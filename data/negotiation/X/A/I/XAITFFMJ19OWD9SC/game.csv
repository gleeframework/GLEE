"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12500, which is still a good price for you, considering your value of $12000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12500 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13500 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay. How about we settle on $13000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $13250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
