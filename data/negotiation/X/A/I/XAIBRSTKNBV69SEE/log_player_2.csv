Considering its high quality and the value it brings, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing this product for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

While Alice's offer of $95 is a discount, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice or going with John."
