"Alice, your offer is enticing, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a good deal for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's finalize this deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your serious interest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,5,
