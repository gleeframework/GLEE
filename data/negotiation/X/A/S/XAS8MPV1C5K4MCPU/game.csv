"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident we can find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,500 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference at $11,250. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
