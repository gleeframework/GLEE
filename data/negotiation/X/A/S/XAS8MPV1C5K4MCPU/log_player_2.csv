"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still above his maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation. He should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he's still willing to pay $1,000 less than Alice's offer. He has a few rounds left and there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,500 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference at $11,250. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $11,250 is outside of Bob's budget. 
* **Negotiation is getting difficult:**  Alice is being stubborn, and the price isn't moving down significantly.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  John's offer is within Bob's budget, and it guarantees he gets the product.

While Bob could continue negotiating with Alice, there's a real risk she won't come down further. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further potential frustration."
