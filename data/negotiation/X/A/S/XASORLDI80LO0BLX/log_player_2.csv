It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  You can offer a lower price and potentially get a better deal than $850,000."

I'm offering a price of $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I believe it's a fair price, while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000

Alice's counteroffer of $790,000 is getting closer to my desired price. It's still above my initial counteroffer, but I'd rather get the product now for $790,000 than continue negotiating and risk Alice walking away, or having to buy from John for $1,000,000."
