Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Aiming for Maximum Profit:** Offering the product at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, potentially persuading Bob to consider a price higher than his initial valuation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but always keep in mind your $15,000 baseline from John."
