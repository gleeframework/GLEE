"I understand your position, Bob, but $200 is already a significant discount on my end. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $160 is still above my budget.  How about we settle on $120? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $120.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $140? This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $130. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,
