{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice's offer is $95.  It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price.  You can counteroffer, potentially get a better deal, and still save some money compared to buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is a better offer than Alice's initial $95, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You're better off continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to $85."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $92.5 is the best deal you've gotten so far, and it's still within your budget of $100.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your offer again, or you might end up buying from John at $100. It's a good compromise to accept Alice's offer and get the product for a reasonable price."
