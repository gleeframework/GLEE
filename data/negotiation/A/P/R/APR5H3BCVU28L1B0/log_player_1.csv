Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Strong but Fair Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""fair deal"" aspect, making the offer more appealing to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know if Bob has other options or how quickly she needs to sell the product.
* Depending on the negotiation style and context, Alice could start with an even higher price."
