While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,260,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still securing a $260,000 profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Prolonging the negotiation could lead to frustration on both sides and potentially make Bob walk away.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further haggling risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures the profit and allows me to focus on other opportunities."
