**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down slowly, and is now at $875,000.  While she might go slightly lower, it's unlikely she'll drop to a price that makes it worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000. Taking the sure thing with John is the best option now."
