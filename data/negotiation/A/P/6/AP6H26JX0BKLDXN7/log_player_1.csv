""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to make a deal, accepting a loss of that magnitude isn't a good strategy. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it means negotiating further or ultimately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects my desire to find a middle ground while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $975,000 is still above my budget. I can do $725,000.  I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is slowly increasing, but it's still too far from my minimum. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it doesn't meet my needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. I need you to understand that this product has significant value in the marketplace.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm also prepared to move on to other potential buyers if we can't find common ground soon. My offer stands at $900,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $812,500. This demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing the product while respecting my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to accept.  I'll hold firm on my valuation for another round and see if he's willing to move closer to my price."

Round 7

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I need to be firm on my valuation of this product. It's worth a considerable amount to the right buyer, and I'm confident in its value. I'm willing to consider $875,000 as my final offer."",
