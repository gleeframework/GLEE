 You can get a better price from Alice.  Let's see if she'll come down."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $100 to $90, and now I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $87.5, which is a good price for you. It's slightly more than what you'd like to pay, but still cheaper than John's offer. Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
