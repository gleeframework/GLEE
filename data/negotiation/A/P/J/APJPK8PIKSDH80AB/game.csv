"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. Would you be interested in taking it for that price?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $12,500. Would that work for you?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a great deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
