"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that owning this will be highly beneficial for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, we aim to anchor Bob's perception of its worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This signals your willingness to negotiate and gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  It's likely we can push for a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, the product's value is truly significant, and I need to get closer to $1,950,000 for this deal to make sense for me. This reflects the true worth and potential of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** We're lowering our price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Smaller Concession:** The decrease from $2,000,000 to $1,950,000 is smaller than Bob's previous concession, signaling that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Reiterate Value:** We're continuing to emphasize the product's value to justify the high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,700,000 is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly decreased his offer, but it's still above our minimum acceptable price. We're not ready to settle just yet. We have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,825,000? I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll be gaining from this product."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,825,000, we're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,700,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,950,000). This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Finality and Confidence:** The language used (""Let's find a middle ground"", ""confident this price reflects the value"") suggests we're getting closer to a final decision point.  
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price point still ensures a profit above our $1,500,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,825,000. Can we try $1,750,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant profit above our minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Accepting now capitalizes on his momentum.
* **Time Value:**  We still have rounds left, but there's a risk that continued negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting a good offer now avoids potential for losing the deal altogether."
