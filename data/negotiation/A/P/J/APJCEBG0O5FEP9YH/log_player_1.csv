"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to him, so he'll likely counter.  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or going with John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter again, but I'm starting to consider selling to John. We're nearing the halfway point, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm getting closer to my minimum, and Bob seems to be getting closer to his maximum. If he doesn't accept this offer, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation and  I've already rejected several offers from Bob.  I'm not confident we will reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob."
