"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $900,000. Would you be open to a deal in that range?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget targets.  I've tried to be flexible, but to be transparent, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal today.  If you're able to meet me at $1,250,000, we have an agreement. This offer stands for the remainder of today's negotiations only, as I do have other potential buyers to consider.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would allow me to make the purchase while acknowledging the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
