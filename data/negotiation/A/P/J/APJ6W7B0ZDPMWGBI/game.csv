"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90.  That's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $90 is still a little too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,5,
