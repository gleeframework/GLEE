"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me is no more than $1,200,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This gives you a good deal and keeps me closer to my target price.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $1,200,000.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a small adjustment, and it gets us closer to a deal. How does that sound?",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $1,200,000.",920000.0,Bob,6,
