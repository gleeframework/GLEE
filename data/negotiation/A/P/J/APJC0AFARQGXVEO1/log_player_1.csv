{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me is no more than $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to my goal of $1,000,000 with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This gives you a good deal and keeps me closer to my target price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $925,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $950,000. I believe I can get there with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a small adjustment, and it gets us closer to a deal. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal to another buyer or being stuck with a lower price from John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
