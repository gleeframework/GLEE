Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, even exceeding the value you anticipate gaining from it.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high aims to secure the highest possible profit. While Bob values the product at $800,000, he might be willing to pay a premium to acquire it immediately and avoid missing out. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can gradually reduce the price, staying closer to our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** We have a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose out as we can sell it to John at our desired price.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale, aiming for the best possible outcome."
