"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get the product for cheaper than $100, so it makes sense to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'm willing to offer you $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You are still trying to get a lower price than $105, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $97.50.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $97.50 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

You have a few reasons to accept this offer:

* **Price is within your budget:** $102.50 is below your maximum price of $120.
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has shown willingness to compromise, and you've gotten the price down from $105.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, Alice might increase her price again, or you might lose the deal entirely. 

Therefore, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
