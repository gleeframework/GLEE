,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'm willing to offer you $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $97.50.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $97.50 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
