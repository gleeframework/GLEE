"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $11000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still see a good value in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $10,750. That's a good price for me, and it's a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10875 for the product. This is a great price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal without further negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his ideal price, and Alice's offer is now within his budget.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising her price again exists.  At this point, accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob without risking a worse outcome."
