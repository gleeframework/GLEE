Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to my operations, and I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This offer reflects the value I see in the product, while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear that getting him significantly closer to $1,500,000 will be difficult.  It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting a lower offer when John provides a guaranteed $1,500,000."
