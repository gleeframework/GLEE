**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,800,000 reflects that value more accurately. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While it's getting closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable spending. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
