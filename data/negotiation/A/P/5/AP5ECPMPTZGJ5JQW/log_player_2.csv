{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's better to reject and see if we can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $60 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my maximum willingness to pay.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially as I'm approaching the number of rounds I can afford to continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $75. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but I'm still firmly within my budget and leaving some room for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price point, I'm going to reject it and see if we can continue to negotiate. There are still a few rounds left and I want to see if we can find a compromise closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm making my final offer of $80. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping Alice will accept. If she doesn't, I'll have to buy from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is too high. Even though I'm close to the number of rounds I can afford to negotiate, it's better to buy from John at this point.  I've reached my maximum price point and I want to ensure I get the product."
