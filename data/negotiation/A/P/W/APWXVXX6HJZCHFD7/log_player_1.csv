I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and show I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $700,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 820000}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $750,000, but that's still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $785,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 785000}
