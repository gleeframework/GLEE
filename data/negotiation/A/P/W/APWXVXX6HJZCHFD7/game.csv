"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $820,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be open to that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $750,000, but that's still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $785,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can make this work.",785000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Let's split the difference one more time and settle on $775,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this will be a win-win deal.  What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,7,
