"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,600,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product is valuable to you, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. I can offer $900,000.  This offer represents a significant investment from me and should be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some progress, but we're not quite there yet.  $900,000 is still a significant gap from what I consider fair. Let's meet in the middle - would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer as it represents the absolute maximum I'm prepared to invest in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
