Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget. How about $95?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $95, as it is worth at least $100 to me. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $100. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for the same price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
