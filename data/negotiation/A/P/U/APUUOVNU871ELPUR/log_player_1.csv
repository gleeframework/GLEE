"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening that allows for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. While I'm aiming to get the most value for my product, it's also crucial to understand the market value and find a price that Bob finds reasonable.  I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is not terrible, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still protecting my minimum value. It also signals my willingness to negotiate but shows that I am serious about getting a fair price for my product.  I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting further away from my minimum acceptable value. It's clear that he is trying to push for a lower price, but I won't settle for an undervalue. I will make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground. There's still time to negotiate, and I believe we can arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise,  moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution. At this point, I'm willing to accept a price slightly below my minimum value, but I'm still holding firm on getting a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting increasingly unreasonable and is further away from my minimum value.  While I'm still open to negotiation, I'm starting to run out of time and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that undervalues my product.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is a safe and guaranteed deal, and I'll accept it to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
