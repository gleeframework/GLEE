{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open ended:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to see how he feels about the price and gauge his potential interest.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:** I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible.
* **Test the waters:** I'm gauging Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I have the option to adjust my price based on Bob's response or move on to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $17000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still below my ideal price. I'm not desperate to sell and want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Continue negotiating:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to $20,000, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **See if Bob is serious:** Bob's willingness to counteroffer shows he's interested, and rejecting might encourage him to come up with a better offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting immediately, I retain control in the negotiation and show that I'm not willing to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $18,500? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing willingness to compromise.
* **Middle ground:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer ($20,000) and Bob's offer ($17,000).
* **Reasoning:** I justify my price by emphasizing the product's value. This helps me make a stronger case for my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and positive tone to encourage further negotiation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and agree to the price.
* **Increase potential earnings:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, so this is a win for me if Bob accepts.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can still adjust my offer in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $18000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $18,000 is very close to my last offer of $18,500. It's a significant increase from his previous offer and is only $500 below my desired price. Given that John is offering $15,000, it makes sense to accept this offer and secure a sale at a price I'm comfortable with. 

Here's why:

* **Close to desired price:**  $18,000 is within a reasonable range of my desired price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While there's a possibility of pushing for $18,500, there's also the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a profitable price, securing a better deal than selling to John.

By accepting Bob's offer, I minimize risk while still achieving a good outcome."
