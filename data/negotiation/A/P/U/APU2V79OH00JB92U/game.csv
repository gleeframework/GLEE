"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $850,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $850,000. How about we settle at $725,000?  It's a significant step closer to your asking price.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $725,000 is still not high enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I can see we're both motivated to close this deal.  How about $775,000? This is a strong offer and I'm hoping we can find an agreement on this.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. Let's aim for a final agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,
