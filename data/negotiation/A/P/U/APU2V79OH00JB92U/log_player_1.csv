"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $850,000. How about we settle at $725,000?  It's a significant step closer to your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
