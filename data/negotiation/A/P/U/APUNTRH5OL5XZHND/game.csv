"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $9,000 for the product. This allows us to bridge the gap between our initial offers while still providing a fair profit for me. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to pay $8,750 for the product, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",8750.0,Bob,4,
