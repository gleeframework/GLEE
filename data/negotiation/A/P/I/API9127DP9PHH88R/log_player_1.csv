Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I get a price closer to my value of $1,500,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough to justify selling the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a good price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer or losing the deal altogether.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
