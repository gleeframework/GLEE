"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for it. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $1,100,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close the sale quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I can do $1,120,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe the product's value to you justifies this price, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
