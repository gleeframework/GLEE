Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for $70. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $70 to $80, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer of $75. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the margin. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating, and I'm willing to risk losing a few more rounds for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $82.  Let's call it a day at this price and we can both be happy with the outcome. "", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80 to $82, so I'll offer $81. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $81
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $81. While I was hoping to get closer to $85, it's important to remember that I have a guaranteed $80 offer from John.  With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking losing Bob as a buyer and ending up with John's offer.  This is a good compromise and I'm happy with the outcome."
