"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $8,750. This is a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,250. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand you're at your minimum, but I'm also trying to get the best possible deal.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it brings us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make a decision. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price, and I think it's the best we can do. Let's shake on it!",9000.0,Alice,7,
