``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since you have 10 rounds, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round is a good strategy.  You might be able to get a better price from Alice, or if not, you can still choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This demonstrates that I'm serious about negotiating and sets a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still above my ideal price.  With 7 rounds left, I can afford to keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly.  Since Alice is willing to negotiate, I want to show I'm willing to meet halfway.  This demonstrates I'm serious about getting a deal, but also that I'm not going to be bullied into accepting a price too high."
