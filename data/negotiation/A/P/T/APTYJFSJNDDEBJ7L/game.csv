"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership,  $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $1,550,000 for the product. This price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Please consider this offer carefully.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
