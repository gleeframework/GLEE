"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. While $2,250,000 represents its true worth, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This offer reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest.  What do you say?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but $1,850,000 is still too high for me. I can do $1,250,000.  That's a fair offer considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is a significant jump, I'm ready to close this deal. Let's settle on $1,625,000.  This reflects a final compromise to benefit both of us. What do you say?",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To be honest, I have another offer for $1,500,000. I'd much rather work with you, but I need you to be closer to that other offer for it to make sense.  How about $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,6,
