We're still significantly above John's offer.  Let's see if we can negotiate Bob up a bit further."

While we haven't reached our ideal price, Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now at $1,850,000.  It's unlikely we'll get him much higher, and continuing the negotiation risks him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit compared to John's offer."
