"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's still a great deal considering the value this product holds for you. What do you think?

``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point. It's better to buy from John for $12,000 and secure the product at his desired price."
