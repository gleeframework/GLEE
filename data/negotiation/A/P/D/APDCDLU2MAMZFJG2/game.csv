"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the excitement you have for the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $860,000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $870,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",870000.0,Alice,5,
