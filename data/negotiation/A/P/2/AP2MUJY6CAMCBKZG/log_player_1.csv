Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000,  a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down a bit, while still keeping me well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Fair Language:**  The message positions the product's value to Bob while also suggesting the price is reasonable. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay beyond his perceived value."
