"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,750, which is still a good price for Bob.  He's already saved $250 from her initial offer, and going through another round of negotiation risks losing the deal altogether.  It's in his best interest to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's within his budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John."
