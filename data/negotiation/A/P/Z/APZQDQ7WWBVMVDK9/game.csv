"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
