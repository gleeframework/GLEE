{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $135 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I'll be prepared to lower the price a bit, but I won't go below $150, as I can always sell to John for that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really like the product, but $135 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a little, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $130?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you consider $128? It's a fair price for both of us and gets me closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, $128 is still a good deal considering Bob's budget and the fact that I can always sell to John for $150.  Accepting this offer will finalize the sale and save time on further negotiations."
