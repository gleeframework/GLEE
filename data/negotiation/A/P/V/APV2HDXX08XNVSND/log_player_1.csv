"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, so I'm not going to accept anything lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can come to a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
