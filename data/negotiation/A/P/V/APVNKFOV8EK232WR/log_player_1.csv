"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point.  I know it's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.  I'll keep an eye on the rounds and the potential of selling to John if it looks like I won't get a good enough price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more.  I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting at least this amount and will be willing to meet me there. If not, we can continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
