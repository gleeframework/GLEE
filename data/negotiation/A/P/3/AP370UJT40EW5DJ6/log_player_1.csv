"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm starting the price at $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value. Selling to John for $100 is always an option, but I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? It's a fair price for a great product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $97.50 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm still optimistic about reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal. While $97.50 is closer to my price, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we meet at $102.50?  This would be a fair compromise and  a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $102.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge much further.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $100 from John."
