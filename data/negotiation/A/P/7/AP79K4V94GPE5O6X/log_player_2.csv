Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and  I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $1,087,500.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to finalize.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. At $1,087,500, the deal is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While there's always a chance to push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or running out of rounds outweighs the potential gain.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
