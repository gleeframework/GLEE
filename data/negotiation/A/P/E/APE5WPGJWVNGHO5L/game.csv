,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows for a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,150,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,250,000, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
