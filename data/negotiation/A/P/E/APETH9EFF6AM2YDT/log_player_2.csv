# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you want to save as much money as possible, you're still willing to spend up to $150. Alice's offer of $140 is within your budget and saves you $10 compared to John."
