Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 aims to split the potential profit ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000) with Bob. This gives Bob a $2,000 incentive to buy from you while securing a $2,000 profit for yourself. 

This strategy is a starting point. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's perceived eagerness, you could potentially start with a slightly higher price and negotiate down. However, this initial offer represents a strong balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
