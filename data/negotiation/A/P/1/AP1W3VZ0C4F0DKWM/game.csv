"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something that would be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000, reflecting its exceptional quality and potential. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $900,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900,000 is lower than my initial price, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for that price. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
