"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay $75, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $82.50. I'm willing to go to $80, which is what I'd pay John for the same product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
