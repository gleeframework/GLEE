Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  This gives him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's not too far off from Bob's valuation, making it more likely he'll accept.

Let me know what Bob says, and I'll help you navigate the next steps!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum valuation of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a price that is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's also closer to my minimum valuation.  This makes it more likely that Bob will accept, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $90. How about we meet at $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still below the $120 I could get from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $95.  That's a fair price that allows me to make a profit and hopefully still meets your needs."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation.  This shows flexibility while still ensuring I make a profit. Hopefully, this counteroffer will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $87.50? That's the closest I can get to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.5 is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still not ideal.  I'm willing to risk losing this sale to Bob and instead go with the guaranteed $120 from John.  It's important to prioritize getting the best possible price for my product, even if it means walking away from a potential deal."
