```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is a factor:**  We're in the penultimate round, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a further counteroffer.
* **A reasonable price:** While not ideal, $950,000 is still a good price. It's lower than your initial budget and offers a potential profit margin for Alice.
* **Avoiding risk:** Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed purchase but at a higher cost. Accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures the product.

Given the circumstances, it's wise to accept Alice's offer and close the deal."
