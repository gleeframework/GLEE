"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $925000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I still feel that $925000 is slightly out of my budget range. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
