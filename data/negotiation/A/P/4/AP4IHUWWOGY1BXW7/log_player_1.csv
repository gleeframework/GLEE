I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get a higher offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I hoped for, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  With only 6 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal and avoid selling to John for a lower price."
