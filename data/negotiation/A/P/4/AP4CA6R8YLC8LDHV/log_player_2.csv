"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** $900,000 is less than $1,200,000.
* **But, it's still too high for Bob's target:**  Bob wants to spend no more than $1,200,000, and $900,000 exceeds that. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
