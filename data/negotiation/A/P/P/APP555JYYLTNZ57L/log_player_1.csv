Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
