**Reasoning:** 

Bob is firmly anchored at $1,200,000. He hasn't budged significantly from this price point, indicating it's likely his ceiling.  Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, continuing negotiations with Bob carries a risk of ending up with a lower final price. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed offer."
