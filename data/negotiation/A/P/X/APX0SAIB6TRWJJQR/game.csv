"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. Let's split the difference - $1,212,500. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
