"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140. Would you be interested in that price?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $120, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $155, which is still below my minimum price but closer to what I'm looking for. Is that something you'd be interested in?",155.0,Alice,5,
