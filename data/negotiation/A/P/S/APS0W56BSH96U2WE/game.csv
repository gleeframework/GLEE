"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,500. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can meet you at $11,200, which is a good compromise considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. Let's see if we can meet in the middle",11200.0,Alice,5,
