"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. However, I cannot lower the price below $140 due to the value I place on this product. To reach a fair compromise, I propose a price of $135. This still allows me to achieve a good profit margin while offering you a reasonable deal. I hope this proposal works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of a price of $132. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase. What do you think?",132.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In order to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I would like to suggest a price of $133 for the product. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a competitive price. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",133.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting close to making a decision, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I've already offered $132, and I'm willing to meet you at $130. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,6,
