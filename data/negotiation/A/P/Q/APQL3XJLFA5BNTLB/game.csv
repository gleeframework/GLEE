"Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price is a little too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, however, $650,000 is significantly below its market value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's unique features and potential for your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my current budget.  I can offer $700,000.  This is a significant investment on my part and reflects my serious interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. I'm willing to consider $1,200,000  as my final offer. Please understand that I have other interested buyers and need to see serious commitment from your side. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm prepared to spend. To be completely transparent, I do have another offer for the product at a significantly lower price point. I'm still very interested in working with you, but I need to see some movement on the price to make this work. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part.",750000.0,Bob,6,
