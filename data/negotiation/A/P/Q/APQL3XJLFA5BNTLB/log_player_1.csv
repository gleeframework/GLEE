Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, however, $650,000 is significantly below its market value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's unique features and potential for your business."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my current budget.  I can offer $700,000.  This is a significant investment on my part and reflects my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. We need to signal that we are willing to walk away."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. I'm willing to consider $1,200,000  as my final offer. Please understand that I have other interested buyers and need to see serious commitment from your side. "",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm prepared to spend. To be completely transparent, I do have another offer for the product at a significantly lower price point. I'm still very interested in working with you, but I need to see some movement on the price to make this work. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
