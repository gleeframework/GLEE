# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's flowery language aside, her offer of $950,000 is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to overpay. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're a savvy buyer and open the door for a potential counter-offer at a more reasonable price."
