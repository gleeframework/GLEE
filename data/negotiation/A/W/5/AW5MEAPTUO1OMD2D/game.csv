"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer of $9000, but I would like to suggest a price of $8500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  Let's close this out.",8750.0,Alice,5,
