"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1350000 to make this worthwhile.

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1300000.

"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  While I appreciate your persistence, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1280000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that still reflects the product's value and potential for your business. Consider it my final offer. ",1280000.0,Alice,7,
