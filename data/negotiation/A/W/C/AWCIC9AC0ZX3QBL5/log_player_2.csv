"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from the true value of the product, and I believe it will be a very profitable investment for you. Please let me know if you're interested. If you decide not to purchase, I have another buyer lined up who's happy to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
