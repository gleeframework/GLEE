Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows for some potential negotiation downwards while still staying significantly above your minimum price.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning listing it publicly implies others might be interested, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
