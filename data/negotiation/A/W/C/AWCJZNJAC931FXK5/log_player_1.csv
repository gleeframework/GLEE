"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,500,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still achieving a favorable outcome.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,500,000, we set a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if this price is unrealistic, it can influence his perception of what a ""fair"" price might be.
* **Leaving Room:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and our minimum is $1,500,000, there's a potential bargaining range.  Starting high allows us to explore that range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price is fair considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum of $1,500,000.  We have room to negotiate and John's offer acts as a strong fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We're coming down from our initial offer, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  We're not just throwing out numbers. We're reiterating the product's value to justify our counteroffer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $2,000,000 keeps us well above our minimum while still leaving room for negotiation. It also puts pressure on Bob to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This price is fair considering the value you've placed on the product and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we could try to push for more, it's unlikely Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer guarantees us our desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale."
