{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and a great value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed.  Since I can always sell to John for $10,000, I'm aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, but it's good to know he's willing to negotiate. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and would make this a worthwhile deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I'm confident I can't get much better.  I'll accept and sell to him for $10,500."
