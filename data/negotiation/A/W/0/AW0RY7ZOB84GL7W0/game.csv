"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and the savings it brings me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  How about $10,500?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $10,800. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
