"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? It's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
