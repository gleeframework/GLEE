"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  While I value the product at $800,000, I want to see if I can get more. If Bob rejects, I'll have to gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I think I can still get more. I'll see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little bit.  I have a few rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum value of $800,000. I'm hoping that this will be a good compromise for both of us. I'm also starting to feel the pressure to close the deal soon, so I'm willing to be more flexible."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I'm starting to run out of time.  I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's closer to my minimum but still allows for some profit. I'm taking a risk here, as I only have a few rounds left. If Bob rejects, I'll have to sell to John, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can close the deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only a few rounds left and Bob's offers not meeting my minimum, I'm going to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John.  I don't want to risk getting a lower price, and I need to secure the sale."
