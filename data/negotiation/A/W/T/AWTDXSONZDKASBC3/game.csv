"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm really looking to stay within a $10,000 budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product? I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high.  $10,500 is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,500 is a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,5,
