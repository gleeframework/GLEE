Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your own valuation of $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
