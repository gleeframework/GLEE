"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your own valuation of $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own valuation of $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
