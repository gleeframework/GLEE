"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have other potential buyers for this product.  To be frank, $1,075,000 is below what I'm comfortable accepting.  If you're unable to move closer to my previous offer, I may have to explore those other options.  I'm open to a reasonable counter, but this is getting close to a deal-breaker for me.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
