Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

Round 4

Bob is holding firm at a price that's cutting it close to my minimum.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away to see if he'll budge further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have other potential buyers for this product.  To be frank, $1,075,000 is below what I'm comfortable accepting.  If you're unable to move closer to my previous offer, I may have to explore those other options.  I'm open to a reasonable counter, but this is getting close to a deal-breaker for me."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm still interested in making a deal with you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is finally moving closer to my range, and $1,090,000 is a solid profit above my minimum. There's more potential upside in continuing to negotiate, but it's getting riskier. Accepting now secures a good deal."
