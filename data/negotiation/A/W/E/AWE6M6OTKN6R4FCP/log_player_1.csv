Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000 and leaves very little room for profit. I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000.  This is a compromise that still allows for a substantial profit while acknowledging Bob's lower offer.  I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price point and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and surpasses my minimum acceptable value.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and potentially lowering his price again is too high.  Selling to John would guarantee $800,000, but this deal with Bob provides a slightly higher profit."
