"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm genuinely interested in this, but I need to stay within my price range.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $12000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. ",13000.0,Bob,4,
