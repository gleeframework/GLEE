"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth to you. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while still allowing you to make a profit. Let's keep talking and see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm lowering the price to $1,050,000, which is still a great value for the product. I'm confident that this price will be more acceptable to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This shows my commitment to a deal, but it also ensures a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we're really close now. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $995,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal and make it happen!",995000.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, we've both been flexible, and we're almost there.  I'm going to make one final offer: $1,000,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and it reflects the true value of this product to me. If we can agree on this, we both walk away happy. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
