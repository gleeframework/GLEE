Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  To start, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you coming down in price, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark quickly enough to be worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer."
