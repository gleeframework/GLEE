"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a valuable piece and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible. He's starting with a lower offer than Alice's price, hoping to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still aiming to save as much as possible. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a price closer to his $11,000 offer. There's still room for negotiation, and he doesn't want to settle for a price he's not entirely comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget. He's raised his offer from $11,000, showing a willingness to compromise."
