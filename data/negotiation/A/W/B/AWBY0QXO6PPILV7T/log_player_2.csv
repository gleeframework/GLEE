Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product, and it's a price that's fair to both of us.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John for the same price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is still not willing to meet my price.  I've already offered my maximum, and it seems like she's not serious about selling at a reasonable price.  It's time to move on and buy the product from John for $100."
