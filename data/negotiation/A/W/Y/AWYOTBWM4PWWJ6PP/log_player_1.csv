"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit higher than my minimum, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'll see if I can convince him to pay closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to get a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating,  Bob's offer of $155 is only slightly above my minimum and John is offering $150. It's not worth risking further rounds to potentially get a slightly better offer from Bob. I'll take the $155 and sell to Bob."
