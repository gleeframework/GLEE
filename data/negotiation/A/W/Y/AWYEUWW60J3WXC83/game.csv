"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $90. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you think $75 is a fair offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight discount to $85. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $80. I can offer you a small discount from my previous offer, and sell it to you for $87. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",87.0,Alice,7,
