Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $80. I can offer you a small discount from my previous offer, and sell it to you for $87. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go down to $80.  It's better to secure the deal with John at your target price than risk Alice not budging further and losing the opportunity."
