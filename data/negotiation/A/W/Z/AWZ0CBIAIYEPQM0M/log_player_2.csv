"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $100 by you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's work together to find a fair price. How about we start at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $100, but her initial offer is $90.  
* **You have leverage.**  You can always buy from John for $100, which gives you a baseline for negotiation. 
* **First round is for positioning.** By rejecting the offer, you show Alice that you're serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to buy the product for $85. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $85 is a fair compromise, considering Alice's worth is $80 and your maximum is $100.
* **Be polite and positive:**  Maintaining a good rapport will help keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate and find a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $87.50 for the product. I hope this helps move us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal price.**  $87.50 is only $2.50 more than your initial counteroffer of $85. 
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.**  While you could potentially get a lower price, the time and effort involved in continuing the negotiation might not be worth the potential savings.
* **You're saving money.**  By accepting this offer, you're saving $12.50 compared to buying from John."
