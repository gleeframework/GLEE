"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,800 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's my absolute limit. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $10,650.",10650.0,Bob,6,
