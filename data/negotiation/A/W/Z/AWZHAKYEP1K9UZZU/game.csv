"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? It's still a bit above my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Bob,4,
