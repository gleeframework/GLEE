Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $15,000, giving Bob some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's a significant amount:** Bob knows he's getting a good deal, but it's still a substantial amount for him to consider.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $13,000. There's potential for a higher price, especially since Bob acknowledges the product's worth. 

We'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? It's still a bit above my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $11,500, which is closer to our desired price than his initial offer of $11,000. While we can continue negotiating,  accepting this offer is a good compromise, especially considering the risk of him walking away and us having to sell to John for a lower price."
