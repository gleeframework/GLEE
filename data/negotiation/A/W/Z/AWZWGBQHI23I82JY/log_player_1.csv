"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, $1,200,000.  This is the price John is willing to pay, so I'm not losing anything by starting high and seeing if Bob is willing to meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's not even close to my minimum. I will reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,150,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject and see if we can get closer to a deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000}
```

I'm going to drop my price a little bit more to $1,120,000.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm recognizing that Bob may not be willing to go much higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but still not acceptable. I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a better price from him.  It's better to sell to John now and secure my desired price than to risk further negotiations with Bob."
