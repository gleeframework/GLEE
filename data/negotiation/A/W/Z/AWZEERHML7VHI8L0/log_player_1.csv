I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This price is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I believe this price is a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This price is still above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price with this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still a bit too low.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation at this point.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get the best possible price for my product and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
