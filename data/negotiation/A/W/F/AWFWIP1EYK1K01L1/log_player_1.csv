Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still significantly below what I'd get from someone else. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It's below your minimum, but still leaves room for you to make a profit and potentially earn more if Bob accepts.
* **It's friendly and open to negotiation:**  The message signals a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target. It's worth pushing for a higher price, as John is still waiting to purchase for $120.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $92.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
