"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a cheaper price from Alice, even if it takes a few rounds of negotiation. Buying from John would cost you significantly more. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives Alice room to counter, but also signals your willingness to negotiate seriously. It's a good starting point to see if you can find a mutually agreeable price within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above your preferred price point, and you're confident that you can negotiate her down further. While $1,300,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for improvement before committing.  A counteroffer will show Alice you're serious about finding a deal within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your offer slightly from the previous round, showing you are willing to compromise.  It still leaves a decent margin for Alice to counter, but it's a step closer to your desired price point and keeps the negotiation moving in the right direction.  You are still confident you can get a better price than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is now within your budget of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than what John is offering. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John at a higher price is now too high. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price."
