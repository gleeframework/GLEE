Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $140. I believe it's a great deal and will be valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate but still ensures a profit if he accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is above Bob's perceived value ($100) but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This might entice him if he's particularly interested. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale without relying solely on John."
