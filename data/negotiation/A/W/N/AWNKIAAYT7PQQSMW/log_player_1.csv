Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to accept.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
