"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do any better on the price? How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $850,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit much for me.  How about $750,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering it's a significant saving for me and still a good profit for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
