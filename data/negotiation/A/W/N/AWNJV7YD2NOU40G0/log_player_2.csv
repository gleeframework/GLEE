You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 20%. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate.  If she rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on her counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price than $800,000, especially since I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still aiming for a price lower than her last offer. This is a compromise that could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $820,000, which is closer to my previous offer of $750,000.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, we're nearing the midpoint and the risk of going further is that Alice might dig in her heels and refuse to budge. With only a few rounds left, it's a safer bet to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
