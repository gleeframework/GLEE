Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value it holds for you, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $850,000. I believe this strikes a balance between what I can offer and the value you see in the product.

Reason: While Alice is negotiating, $850,000 is still significantly higher than our ideal price point. We can afford to push a little further and see if she'll come down closer to $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. My counteroffer is $825,000. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's value.

Reason: Alice has come down considerably in price, and $825,000 is a reasonable deal. It's getting close to the point where further haggling might make us lose the deal altogether, and buying from John would be significantly more expensive."
