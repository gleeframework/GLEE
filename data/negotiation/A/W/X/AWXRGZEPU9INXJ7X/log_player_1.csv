Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $150 for it, which I think is a fair price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $150, I'm aiming to maximize potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not presenting the price as a final offer, leaving the door open for Bob to counter. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've made a good profit. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further.  I'll also consider how long I'm willing to continue negotiations before selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to sell at that price. There's still potential for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can try to meet Bob halfway or offer a slight concession.  This could lead to a sale at a price closer to my initial target.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $120 and $150. I'll need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $135?  That gives us both some room to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $135 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positive language:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and showing a willingness to work with Bob.
* **Setting a clear expectation:**  This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about negotiating, but also have a limit.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've achieved a good price while still securing a sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to consider his next counteroffer carefully. If it's too far below $135, I might be more inclined to sell to John for $120 to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $130 is only $5 away from my initial target of $135.  Considering the potential for further negotiation, it might not be worth the risk of going another round.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up to a price I'm happy with. 
* **Limited upside:**  Selling to John at $120 would only yield a slightly lower profit than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. I've achieved a good price and avoided further negotiation."
