Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging message creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  A brief mention of the product's value (""I think you'd really enjoy it"") can subtly increase its perceived worth. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! You've made a good profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** Be prepared to counter-offer or accept his counteroffer based on how close it is to your minimum.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  If the negotiation drags on, or Bob becomes unreasonable, you can always switch to John and sell for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Minimum Value:** Although $80 is your minimum acceptable price,  Bob's counteroffer is at that minimum.  There's no immediate gain, and it's worth exploring if you can potentially get a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation. You can counter with a slightly lower price than your initial offer ($100), potentially reaching a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Weighing Options:** While selling to John guarantees $80, it's risky to assume you won't get a better price from Bob.  Negotiation can lead to a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is definitely a good starting point.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a middle ground between your initial offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($80). It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a better price.
* **Positive Language:**  The message remains friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Justified Offer:**  The counteroffer is presented as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great!  You've struck a deal. 
* **Bob Rejects:**  Be prepared to counter-offer again or accept his new offer (if it's closer to $90).
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  If negotiation stalls, remember that John is still waiting to buy the product for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is just $5 above your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While you could counter-offer again, it's unlikely you'll get much higher than $85.  Continuing could risk losing Bob entirely.
* **Time is Money:** The negotiation has been going on for a few rounds, and it's time to secure a deal.  $85 is a good profit, and delaying could lead to no sale at all.

**Reasoning:**

In this case, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision. While a higher price is always desirable, it's crucial to balance potential gains with the risk of losing the sale altogether.  $85 is a solid profit, and it's wiser to secure that deal than to risk further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate or a lower price."
