"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for your product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $15,000 for this. How about we split the difference and meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $13,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
