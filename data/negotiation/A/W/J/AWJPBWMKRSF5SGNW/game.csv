"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000. This is my absolute maximum, as I can buy it from another seller for that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8000.0,Bob,4,
