"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1400000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm still confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $1700000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling we got a good deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
