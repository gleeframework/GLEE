"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being fair to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,000,000? This would be a significant investment for you, and I believe it would offer a substantial return.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
