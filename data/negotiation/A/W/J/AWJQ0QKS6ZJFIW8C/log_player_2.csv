"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $90, so rejecting the offer is the best first step.  You can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal. Would you be willing to let it go for $85? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to let it go for $85 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $87? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $87 is a good deal for you. You're getting the product for less than your maximum price of $100 and it's closer to your desired price of $85.  It's better to accept than to risk going back and forth further with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
