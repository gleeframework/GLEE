"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $80, and John is also selling the product for $80, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to consider other options or wait for a better deal."
