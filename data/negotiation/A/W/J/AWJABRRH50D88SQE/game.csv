"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer. $13,000 is still a touch more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really love it.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'm happy to hear you're willing to be flexible.  While I agree it's a great product, my budget is firm at $12,000.  I understand that might not leave you much room, but I'd be ready to close the deal immediately at that price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
