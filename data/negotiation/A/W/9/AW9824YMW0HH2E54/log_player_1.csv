Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate but leaves room for you to make a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum desired price.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The friendly message indicates you're willing to work with Bob.

This strategy allows you to see if Bob is willing to pay more than he initially thought while still protecting your own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $8,500. How about we try $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more time to get closer to my target price.  I'm not going to risk selling to John yet, as I still have a chance to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is the best price we can reach. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my target price, but I still think $9,250 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,500. How about we try $8,625? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, as $8,625 is close to my minimum, but I've already rejected Bob's offer twice and I'm not sure he's willing to go any higher.  I'm also worried that if I reject his offer again, he'll walk away.  I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John for $10,000. It's a sure thing, and I'll get the price I want."
