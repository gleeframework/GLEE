"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $8,500. How about we try $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is the best price we can reach. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my target price, but I still think $9,250 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,500. How about we try $8,625? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8625.0,Bob,6,
