"Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm starting with a price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $150 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is too low for me. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant at $95.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $100. It's a fair price, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",100.0,Bob,6,
