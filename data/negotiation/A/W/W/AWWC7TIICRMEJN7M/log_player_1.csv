"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to start the conversation at $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly closer to his perceived value than mine. While I could push for more, there's a risk he might walk away.
