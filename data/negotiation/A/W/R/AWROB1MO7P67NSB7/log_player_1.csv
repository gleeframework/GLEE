I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000.  This is the price I'd get from John if Bob rejects the offer, so it's the best possible outcome for me. 

While I know the product is only worth $800,000 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more to secure the product, especially if he believes it's valuable to him. It's a gamble, but it's the only way I can potentially earn more than my minimum acceptable price."
