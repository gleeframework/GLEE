"Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I can't go lower than $11,500. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and yours at $11,125. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll be selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly getting impatient and hinting that she has other options. While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting close to John's price. Accepting $11,125 ensures I get the product and still save some money."
