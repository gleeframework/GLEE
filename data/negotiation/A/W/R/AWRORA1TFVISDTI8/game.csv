"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I can't go lower than $11,500. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and yours at $11,125. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll be selling to John.",11125.0,Alice,5,
