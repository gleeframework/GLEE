"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I believe that's a reasonable price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
