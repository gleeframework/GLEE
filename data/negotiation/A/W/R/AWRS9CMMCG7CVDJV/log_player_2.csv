"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product at $1,200,000, which is your maximum price. However, you can also buy the product from John for the same price. 

There is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, as you will pay the same price and have the same outcome. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the optimal choice, as you can still acquire the product at your desired price from John."
