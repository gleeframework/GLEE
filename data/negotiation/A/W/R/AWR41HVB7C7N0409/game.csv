"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair deal considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $850,000 to make this work for me.  It's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $1,000,000. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
