"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. Would you be open to $12000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get this product for $11000 elsewhere, so I'm really hoping we can bridge the gap. How about we split the difference and settle on $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
