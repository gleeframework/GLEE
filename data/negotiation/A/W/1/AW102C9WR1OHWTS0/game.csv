"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",142.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $125 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my own costs.  Let's make this deal!",135.0,Alice,5,
