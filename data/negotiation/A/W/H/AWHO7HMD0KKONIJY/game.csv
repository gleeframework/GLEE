"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1,050,000.  This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement.  However, $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum for this product. I believe this price is fair considering its value to your business and my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I hope we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
