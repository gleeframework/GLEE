"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find this a good deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer. There's still time to try and get a better deal before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high.  Let's try $10,750.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and gives you a good return.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's try $10,900.  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of not reaching an agreement. With only five rounds left, the likelihood of getting a better price from Alice is uncertain.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $10,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and secures the product."
