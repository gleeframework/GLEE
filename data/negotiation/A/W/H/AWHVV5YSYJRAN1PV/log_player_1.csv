Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering his valuation. It also leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value of $12,000, I'm not yet satisfied. I have 8 rounds left and I can still try to get closer to my target price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find this a good deal considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high.  Let's try $10,750.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and gives you a good return.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. I have 6 rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
