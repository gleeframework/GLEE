"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find this a good deal considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high.  Let's try $10,750.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and gives you a good return.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's try $10,900.  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds.",10900.0,Alice,5,
