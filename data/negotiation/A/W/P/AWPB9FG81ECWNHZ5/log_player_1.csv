Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and worth much more than that. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $130. This is more than Bob values the product at ($80), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Message:** I'm trying to motivate Bob by highlighting the value of the product and framing the price as a ""deal.""

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $130 is a better price than selling to John for $150.
* **Increase the likelihood of Bob accepting:** I'm offering a price that is more appealing to Bob than my minimum, while still ensuring I make a profit."
