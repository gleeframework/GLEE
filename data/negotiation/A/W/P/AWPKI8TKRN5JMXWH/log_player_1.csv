"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's a bit lower than the product's value to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob an incentive to accept, while also leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $80.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are narrowing down the price. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I still feel there's room for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about $82? That's only $4 away from your last offer and closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 82}
