Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $150. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale for $150 if Bob refuses.

You start with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price. This gives Bob a potential ""deal"" and incentivizes him to buy it now rather than risk you selling it to John."
