"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $8,200. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a good compromise.",8200.0,Alice,5,
