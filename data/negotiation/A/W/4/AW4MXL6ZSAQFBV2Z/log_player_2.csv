{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price.  Since Alice values the product at $15,000, there's a potential for a deal, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still keeping it below Alice's last offer.  I believe this shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price that's more favorable to me.  I hope this will incentivize Alice to make a final concession."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting and getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is always an option if the negotiations with Alice fall apart.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a price closer to my maximum of $12,000."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer once more, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. I'm hoping this will show Alice that I'm committed to reaching a deal, but I'm not willing to pay her asking price. I'm also keeping in mind that I have John as a backup option, which gives me some leverage in this negotiation.  I'm hoping this final push will convince Alice to accept my offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my limit, but it's still above my ideal price point.  We're in the final round, and I don't want to risk ending up paying more than I'm comfortable with. It's better to secure the product from John at my desired price of $12,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
