Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in your product and would be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with selling for $1,150,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
