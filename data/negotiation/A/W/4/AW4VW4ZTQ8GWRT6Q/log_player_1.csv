"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,100,000 is a significant discount for Bob, while still allowing me to make a substantial profit. This tactic aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob accepts immediately, I've secured a good price.
* **Set the tone:**  A high starting offer sets the expectation that the product is valuable. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  It allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without reaching my minimum price too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired $1,100,000. I'm also considering the following:

* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 rounds left, giving me room for more negotiation.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Rejecting now keeps the possibility of a higher offer from Bob open.
* **John's offer:**  I'm not yet desperate enough to settle for John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant profit margin.  This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Maintain my advantage:**  I'm still above my minimum price, giving me room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Test the waters:**  This offer will reveal if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my desired price and it's well above my minimum threshold of $800,000.  Considering:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  I've already made significant progress in negotiations.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation process.
* **John's offer:**  I'm confident that I can secure a much better deal with Bob than John's offer.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
