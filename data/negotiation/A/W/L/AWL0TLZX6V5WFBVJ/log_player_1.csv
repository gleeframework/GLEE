"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob $145, which is a bit higher than his initial offer but still lower than my initial offer. Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
