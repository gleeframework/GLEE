"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** This gives me space to adjust the price if Bob counters, while still maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** The John option provides a safety net, ensuring I won't be stuck with a low price if Bob is unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and well below my initial offer of $9,500. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, leaving room for potential compromise. 
* **Maintaining Value:** Selling to John for $10,000 is still a good option, but I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  $8,500 is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, creating a potential compromise point.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that this is still a good deal.
* **Maintaining Option:** I'm keeping the John option open in case the negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer, Alice. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob is showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal price, but still acknowledging Bob's desire to meet in the middle.
* **Maintaining Value:** Selling to John for $10,000 remains a viable option, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still within your budget."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by moving closer to his desired price.
* **Fair Price:**  $8,000 represents a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining Option:** The John option is still available, but I'm hoping to secure a better price with Bob."
