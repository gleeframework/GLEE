"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13500. Can we compromise at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13500 is closer, I'm still at a loss at that price. How about $14500? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $13000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,
