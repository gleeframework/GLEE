"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  I've priced it at $11,000, which is a great value considering its worth.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $7,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value of $10,000. I have room to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and try to reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a price that feels good. I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  There are still rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go to $8,500,  which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
