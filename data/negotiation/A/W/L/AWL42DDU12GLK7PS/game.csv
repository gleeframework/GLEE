"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value I perceive it to be.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to go up to $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $9500 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10500? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $10250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,6,
