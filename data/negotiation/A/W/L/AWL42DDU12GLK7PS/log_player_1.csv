"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value I perceive it to be. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I also have the option of selling to John as a backup, so I'm not under too much pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to go up to $9500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping to get a better price.  The possibility of selling to John for $8,000 is a safety net, giving me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $10250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and is closer to my desired profit margin.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle with John for a lower price."
