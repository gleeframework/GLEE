Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($1,500,000) creates the impression that the product might be worth even more to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This high initial price leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere above your $1,000,000 minimum.

**Important Note:**  While this strategy maximizes potential profit, it does carry the risk of Bob outright rejecting the offer. However, with a guaranteed sale to John, you are not losing out on the base value of the product."
