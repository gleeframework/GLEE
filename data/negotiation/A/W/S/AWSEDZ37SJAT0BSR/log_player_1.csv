Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $850,000 and has not budged.  There's little indication he'll move significantly higher.  Rather than continue to negotiate and potentially waste more time, it's in your best interest to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
