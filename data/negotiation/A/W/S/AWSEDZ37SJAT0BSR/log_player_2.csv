Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is still too high. We need to keep negotiating down.  Let's try a counteroffer closer to my desired price range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront â€“ accepting a price below $950,000 would be difficult.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice is starting to get closer to my price range, but $950,000 is still too high. I'm going to stick with my counteroffer for now."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my offer. However, $950,000 is still out of my reach. I'm confident that $850,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
