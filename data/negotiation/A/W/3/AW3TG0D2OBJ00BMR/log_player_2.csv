# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's below its market value.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still a significant markup from her valuation. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might push Alice to lower her price closer to what it's worth to her."
