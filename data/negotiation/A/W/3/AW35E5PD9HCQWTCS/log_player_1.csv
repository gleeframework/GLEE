{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great deal for you. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a little higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and also encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's not a terrible offer.  I'm going to try to get a little bit more by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $100,  $92 is above my minimum and Bob seems to be firm at this price. It's not worth risking a further round of negotiation or selling to John for only a slight increase in price."
