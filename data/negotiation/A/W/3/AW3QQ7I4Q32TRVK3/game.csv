"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my top price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for providing your perspective. While I recognize your position, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
