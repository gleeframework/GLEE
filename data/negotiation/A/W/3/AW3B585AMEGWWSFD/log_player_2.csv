"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is less than Alice's value of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $115?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as close to his maximum of $120 as possible.  Offering $115 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $115 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $125 for it.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is close to Bob's maximum, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He can get the product from John for $120, so there's still room to bargain with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final counteroffer. He's offering his maximum price, which is the same price he can get from John.  This shows Alice that there's no further room for negotiation. It's a ""take it or leave it"" offer."
