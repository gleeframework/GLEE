"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is way above your budget and even her own product valuation. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than my budget, I aim to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a great deal. 
* **Polite & Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating my price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still keeping John's $80 offer as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90 for you. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer has come down significantly, $90 is still above our $80 budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John as Backup:** We still have the option to buy from John at $80 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? "",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting the Midpoint:** By suggesting $75, we're directly aiming for the middle ground between her last offer ($90) and our previous counteroffer ($60). 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The tone remains collaborative, showing Alice we're interested in reaching a deal that works for both of us.
* **Staying Strategic:**  This offer is still below our $80 maximum, preserving our budget and leaving a small margin for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about $85?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:**  Alice's offer of $85 is now within our $80 budget, with only a small overage.
* **Minimal Savings from John:** Buying from John would only save us $5 at this point. 
* **Not Worth the Risk:**  Further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price from Alice, and there's a chance she could walk away. It's better to secure the product now at a reasonable price."
