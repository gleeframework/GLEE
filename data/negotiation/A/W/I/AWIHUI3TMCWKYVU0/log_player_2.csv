"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's wise to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. How about $10500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $10000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $10,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for further negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm firm on my offer of $9,000. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. I'm willing to throw in a bonus feature that's worth $1000 if you're willing to meet me at $10000. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, even with the bonus feature. At this point, Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has shown reluctance to come down further.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and it's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
