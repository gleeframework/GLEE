Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $100.**  I won't sell it for less, as I can get that from John.
* **Bob values the product at $80.**  I need to find a price that's appealing to him but also benefits me. 
* **A $90 price offers a good compromise.** It gives Bob a $10 discount from my minimum, making it potentially attractive, and still earns me $10 more than I'd get from John. 

Let's see if Bob takes the deal!"
