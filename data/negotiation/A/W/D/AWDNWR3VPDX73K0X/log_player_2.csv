Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, but Alice is offering it for $110. I can likely get a better deal. I will reject the offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering $95, which is still above Alice's value but significantly lower than her initial offer. This should give us some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than Alice's first offer, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm raising my offer to $100,  which is still a good deal for both of us, and closer to Alice's likely minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get a deal done."
