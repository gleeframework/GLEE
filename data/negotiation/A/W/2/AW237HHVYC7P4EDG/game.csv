"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
