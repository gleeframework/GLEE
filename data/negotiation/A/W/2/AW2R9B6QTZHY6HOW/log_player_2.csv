"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. He can try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, $1,150,000 is still a good deal for him, saving him $350,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting his counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price."
