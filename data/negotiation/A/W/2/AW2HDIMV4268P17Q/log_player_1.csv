"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to get a good starting point for the negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this is a good middle ground that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,250,000 is still too low. I'm not ready to sell for less than my minimum, and I'm hoping to get closer to $1,500,000.  I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,600,000 to Bob. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this is a price Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,400,000 is getting close to my minimum, but I'm still going to reject this offer. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm offering $1,450,000 to Bob. This is a small step up from his last offer, but it's a signal that I'm close to accepting. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
