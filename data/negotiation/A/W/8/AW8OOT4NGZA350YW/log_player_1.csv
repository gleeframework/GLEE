Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product goes beyond standard comparisons.  I'm willing to move down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,150,000 or lower. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, we still have room to negotiate. His language suggests this is his ""final offer"" to pressure us, but we have time and another option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, and I'm willing to make a significant move to reach a deal. Let's close this out at $1,250,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is our final offer, we signal we're firm on the price and won't go lower.
* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):**  This price is closer to the middle ground between his last offer and our previous one, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit with Bob, we're still above our guaranteed sale price with John if Bob refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be at $1,100,000 or lower to make this deal work for me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $1,100,000 is still a significant profit above our $1,000,000 guarantee with John.
* **Bob's Firmness:**  Bob has repeatedly used ""final offer"" language, suggesting he's reached his limit. Pushing further risks losing the sale altogether.
* **Time Investment:** Continuing negotiations with uncertain outcomes could waste valuable time we could use finding other potential buyers if needed."
