Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.

Offering the product at $145 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal (saving $5 from a perceived higher value), while still netting Alice a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
