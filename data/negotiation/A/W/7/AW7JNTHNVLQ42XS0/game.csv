"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $15,500? This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's still well above the value you placed on the product. Let's make this deal happen!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, and that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
