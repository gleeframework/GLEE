"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than its true value to you, and I'll still be making a substantial profit. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $850,000. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a price closer to $950,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a price that allows me to get closer to the value I'm hoping for.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit. How about $900,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
