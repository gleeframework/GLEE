"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've outlined. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
