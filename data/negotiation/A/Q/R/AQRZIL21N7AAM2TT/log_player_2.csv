"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10000. I think it's a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $10,500 is closer to his desired price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000).  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer could potentially lead to a price closer to $9,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000**. This is still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000), but it's less than what John is offering ($12,000).
* **Bob's goal is to save money**.  Accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Alice has stated this is her final offer**. This implies that further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a lower price.

While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Alice will walk away from the deal entirely. Accepting the offer at $11,000 ensures Bob gets the product and saves money."
