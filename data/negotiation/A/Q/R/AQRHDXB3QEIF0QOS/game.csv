"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $700,000, but that's really the most I can justify spending on this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we have some ground to cover still.  While I aim to find a price that works for both of us, I'm valuing the product significantly higher than your current offer. I'd be willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a considerable reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations is still too wide. To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't agree on a price closer to $750,000. I believe that's a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget constraints.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,6,
