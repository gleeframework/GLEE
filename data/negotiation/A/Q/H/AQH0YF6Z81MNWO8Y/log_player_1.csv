{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob. This gives you some room to negotiate while still securing a profit. It also shows that you're confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations. I want to see if I can nudge Bob up from his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1225000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to go up to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It's important to avoid getting stuck in a loop of counteroffers and risk losing the deal altogether."
