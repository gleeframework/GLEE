Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.  $1,200,000 is still too low for me at this point."
