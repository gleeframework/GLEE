"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product at a competitive price and me to secure a profitable sale. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
