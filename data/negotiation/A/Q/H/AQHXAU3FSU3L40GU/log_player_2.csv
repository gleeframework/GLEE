Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $8,850 for the product. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit margin for myself. I hope this offer meets your expectations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,850 is very close to Bob's final offer of $8,750.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't get a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is only slightly higher than his desired budget, and saves further negotiation rounds."
