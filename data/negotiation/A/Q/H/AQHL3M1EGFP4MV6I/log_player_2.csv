"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to both of us, I propose a price of $11,000 for it. This is slightly above your perceived value but below my cost, aiming for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This is a step closer to your offer while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing out on a deal with John who is offering the product at my target price.  It's better to secure the deal now rather than potentially lose out due to further negotiations."
