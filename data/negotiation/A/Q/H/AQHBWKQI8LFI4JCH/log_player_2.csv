"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Bob's maximum price, there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount while still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $950,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to buy but also leaving room for Alice to counter with a price closer to her desired selling point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still below Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer again and forcing Bob to buy from John at a significantly higher price outweighs the potential savings of a lower price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price without risking a more expensive purchase from John."
