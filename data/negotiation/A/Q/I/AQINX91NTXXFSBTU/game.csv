"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
