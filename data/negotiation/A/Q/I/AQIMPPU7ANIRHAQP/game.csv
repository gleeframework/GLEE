"I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is a good middle ground for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
