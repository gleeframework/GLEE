"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is my bottom line, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $750,000 simply isn't enough for me to move forward.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000.  This is my final offer before I move on to other interested buyers. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, including buying from John for $800,000.",775000.0,Bob,6,
