I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob as it's lower than his estimated value of $1,500,000. 

If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer.  I believe this price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to push for a bit more, I'm not sure I can get a better price.  There's a risk of further negotiation dragging on, and I don't want to lose the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of continuing to negotiate."
