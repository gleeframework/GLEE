"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the special price, my budget for this product is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet your budget of $8,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,250. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",8800.0,Alice,5,
