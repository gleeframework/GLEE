"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,300,000?  This price is still within your stated budget, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's bridge the gap further.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is a good compromise, and it's still within your budget, considering you're willing to pay a premium.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
