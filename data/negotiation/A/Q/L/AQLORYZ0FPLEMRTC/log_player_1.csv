{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my minimum price:** This leaves room for negotiation without losing too much profit. 

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value, it's still lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum price. I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000. Accepting this offer will get me a decent profit, although not as much as I initially hoped for."
