"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to do $85? I'm really interested in the product and would be happy to purchase it at that price.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about $88? This is a really great product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",88.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $88 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $86?  I'm really serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",86.0,Bob,4,
