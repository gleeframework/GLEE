Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  You're still making a profit and leaving room for potential counteroffers. 
* **It's friendly and open-ended:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to do $85? I'm really interested in the product and would be happy to purchase it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about $88? This is a really great product, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $88 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $86?  I'm really serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not willing to go any lower, so it's better to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $100."
