Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $9,500 is a bit more than I can afford right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $8,000, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. My revised offer is $9,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget:** While it's getting closer, $9,250 is still more than your maximum of $8,000. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** Alice has shown a willingness to continue negotiating. 
* **You have a backup:** John's offer gives you a strong negotiating position.

You're close to a deal, but there's still room to bargain and potentially get a price closer to your target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to explore other options. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $9,000 exceeds your budget. 
* **Alice is becoming firm:** Her ""final offer"" statement signals that further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **John's offer is your best option:** You can purchase the product from John for your desired price of $8,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and saves time and potential frustration with further negotiation. 

It's better to take advantage of the guaranteed deal with John than to risk a potential stalemate with Alice."
