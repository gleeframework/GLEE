Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for it. Would you be able to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to budge beyond his valuation of the product, which is lower than my minimum acceptable price.  There's no room for profitable negotiation here. It's better to sell to John at my desired price."
