"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,100,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the competitive price, I'm aiming to secure a deal that maximizes value for both of us.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential for both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,050,000 to Alice, and $1,500,000 to Bob. This means that Alice is offering a price that is closer to her valuation of the product, but still significantly less than what Bob is willing to pay. It's a good deal for Bob, as he saves $450,000 compared to buying from John."
