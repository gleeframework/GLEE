"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $2,000,000? This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $2,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle on this one.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
