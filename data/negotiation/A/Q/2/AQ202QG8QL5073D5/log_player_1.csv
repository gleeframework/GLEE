Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an offer that aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's potential gain:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This presents a significant return on investment for you, considering its worth to someone like yourself. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves him with a potential $50,000 gain, making it a very attractive proposition.
* **Maximizing Your Profit:** This price point nets you $150,000 above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or risk tolerance. Depending on your relationship with Bob and your knowledge of his personality, you might adjust the offer slightly."
