"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $115.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is only asking for $115. This means there's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm happy to pay $110 for the product, would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 110}
