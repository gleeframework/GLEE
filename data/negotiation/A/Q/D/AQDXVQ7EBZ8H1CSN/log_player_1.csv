Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $100 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to earn a good profit. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is only slightly lower than my counteroffer, and it's a good price. I'm willing to accept it to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up selling to John for less."
