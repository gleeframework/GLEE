"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $130.
* **You have better options.** You can either try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm starting with the maximum price I'm willing to pay, knowing it's likely Alice will reject it.
* **Setting the stage:** This establishes my firm stance and gives Alice a clear starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $120.
* **You still have better options.** You can either try to negotiate further with Alice or buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget.
* **Strategic approach:**  I'm aiming for a price in the middle ground, hoping to find a point where Alice might be willing to accept. 
* **Limited room:**  I'm aware that I'm approaching the price I'd pay from John, so I need to be careful about going too high."
