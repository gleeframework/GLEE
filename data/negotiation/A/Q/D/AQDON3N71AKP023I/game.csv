"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my value and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This gives us both a good deal, and ensures we can both walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would leave you with a healthy profit margin. Let's aim for a win-win situation and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 still leaves me too far from my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with this deal. Let's make it happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
