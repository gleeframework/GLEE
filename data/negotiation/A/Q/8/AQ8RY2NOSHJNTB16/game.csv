"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $140, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $150. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $155. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
