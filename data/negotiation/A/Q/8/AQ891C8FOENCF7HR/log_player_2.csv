"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're aiming to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. Alice's opening offer is too high, so rejecting it and counter-offering is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price given my needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. Considering the situation, I would like to offer you the product at $9,000. This is a price that reflects both the value of the product to you and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to your target, you can still try to push for a lower price.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you a better chance to secure a deal closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $8,750. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your offer and the value of the product to you, I am willing to accept $8,900 for the product. This price allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to your target of $8,000.  While you could try to push for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and then potentially offering a higher price again is not worth it.  You're close to your goal, and it's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
