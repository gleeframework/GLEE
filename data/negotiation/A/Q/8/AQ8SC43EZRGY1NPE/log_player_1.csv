"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This strategy balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. However, I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I still believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I need to ask for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still slightly above his stated value. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product too cheaply."
