"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it's well worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for the product. This is still a good value for you, as it's above your own valuation, and it gives me a chance to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. ",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10750.0,Alice,5,
