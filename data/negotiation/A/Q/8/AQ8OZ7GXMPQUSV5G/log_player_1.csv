Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for the product. This is still a good value for you, as it's above your own valuation, and it gives me a chance to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
