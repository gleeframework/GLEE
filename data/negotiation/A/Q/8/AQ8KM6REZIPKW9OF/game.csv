"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is quite far from my asking price.  Could you do $15,000? That would make it worth my while.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but $15,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting close! $12,500 is tempting, but I'm hoping for something a bit closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to go up a little?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
