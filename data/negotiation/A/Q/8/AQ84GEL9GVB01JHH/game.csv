"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $10,000 and I'm willing to go above my budget to get this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
