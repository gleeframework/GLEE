Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality and value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting close to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Odd Pricing:** The slightly odd price of $14,999 can sometimes feel like a better deal psychologically compared to a round number like $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If you had that information, you could tailor your offer more precisely."
