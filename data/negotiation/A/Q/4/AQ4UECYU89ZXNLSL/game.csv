"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're serious about making a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I'm willing to go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I think I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
