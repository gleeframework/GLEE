Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for potential negotiation without risking you selling below your minimum.
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easier for Bob to process and potentially counteroffer.

Remember, if Bob rejects, you can always counteroffer or even sell to John for your desired $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counteroffer Bob.  A good counteroffer would be something like:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about $950,000? It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still significantly lower than your minimum.  You're only $80,000 away from your desired price, and selling to John guarantees that. 

**Next Steps:**

It's time to make a final counteroffer to Bob. This will be your last chance to negotiate with him before selling to John. Consider a counteroffer close to your desired price, perhaps $980,000.  If Bob rejects this final offer, you'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $920,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $980,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product. Can you consider this as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is still below your minimum acceptable price.  You've already made several concessions, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet your price. Selling to John guarantees you the highest possible price and avoids further negotiation."
