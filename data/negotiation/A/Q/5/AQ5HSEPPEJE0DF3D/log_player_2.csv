# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, you know your maximum valuation is $1,500,000, and John is already offering it at that price. 
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. She might be willing to lower it to avoid losing the sale.
* **John's offer as a fallback:** You always have the option to buy from John at $1,500,000 if negotiations with Alice fail. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you're aiming to either get a better price from Alice or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
