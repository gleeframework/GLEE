# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.** You can try to get a lower price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** But you want to see if you can get a better deal from Alice first."
