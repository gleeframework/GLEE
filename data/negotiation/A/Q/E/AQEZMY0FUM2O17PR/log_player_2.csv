"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's initial offer is too high ($15,000) and exceeds my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but need a more reasonable price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always go to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price range, it's still slightly above my $12,000 limit. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  It's possible that with a little more pushing, Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're open to this, we can make a deal. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm serious about the deal. However, I'm still staying below my maximum budget and leaving some room for negotiation. This demonstrates flexibility while keeping my bottom line in mind. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to consider buying from John, as I'm getting closer to my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. Can you go up to this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my $12,000 limit. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further counteroffers going back and forth is increasing. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down to my desired price, and we are already halfway through the negotiation rounds. To avoid risking further time and potential loss of a deal, I'm choosing to buy from John for $12,000. This ensures I get the product at my maximum budget without the risk of further negotiation."
