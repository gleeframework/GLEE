{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate and hopefully reach a middle ground.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you don't immediately lose out on potential profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps avoid any misunderstandings.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

While $960,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go lower.  It's time to move on to John and secure the $1,200,000."
