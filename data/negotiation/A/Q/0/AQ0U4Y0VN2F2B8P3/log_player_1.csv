Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $18,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling flexibility by stating that I'm open to negotiation. This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""fantastic"" and ""interested in"" helps build rapport and makes the offer seem more appealing.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The success of the negotiation will depend on Bob's reaction and your ability to assess his interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $10000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000, and I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob is interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price.  $14,000 is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to work with him.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, which may encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open-ended question:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites further discussion and negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is a strategic counteroffer, but the outcome depends on Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I may need to consider selling to John or making further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $12000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No need for further negotiation:**  There's no point in trying to get a higher price since I'm already at my minimum and Bob is clearly willing to pay that amount.
* **Avoid potential loss:**  Rejecting this offer and counter-offering could lead to further negotiation, which could potentially drag out the process and result in a lower offer from Bob or a decision to sell to John. 

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees the sale at my minimum price, which is the best outcome in this situation."
