"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
