# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $17,000. It's a rare and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
