Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I highlight the product's value and potential benefits for Bob.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and encouraging tone can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling pressured.
* **Backup plan:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not losing money by trying to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident that I can get a higher price from Bob by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is the backup:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $8,000 is quite a bit below what the product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,000?  That's still a great price for you and allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer but providing a reason why it's too low, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Compromise approach:** Offering $10,000 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize a ""great price for you"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Remaining open to negotiation:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I invite further negotiation while maintaining a sense of control over the process."
