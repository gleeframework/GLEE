"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $8,000 is quite a bit below what the product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,000?  That's still a great price for you and allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
