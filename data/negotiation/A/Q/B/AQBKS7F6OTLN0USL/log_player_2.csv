"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, it's beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to do $10,800?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that my initial offer of $11,500 is a fair price for this amazing product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,200? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
At this point, the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. Alice is offering the product for $11,200, a good deal. It is unlikely that Bob can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate. Therefore, accepting the offer is the best option."
