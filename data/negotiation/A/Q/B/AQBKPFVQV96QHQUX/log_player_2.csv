Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8800. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. He's already made a counteroffer at his maximum price point of $8,000, and Alice has rejected it.  Alice's new offer of $8,800 is higher than his budget, and there's a risk that further negotiation will only lead to a higher price. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price point."
