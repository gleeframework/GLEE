Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to $15,000."
