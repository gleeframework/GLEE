"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my estimate of Bob's value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to keep the negotiation going. I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept a price closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer before potentially risking a lower price or losing him as a buyer entirely."
