{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before reaching a potential agreement.
* **Protecting My Value:**  This price is significantly higher than Bob's value, ensuring I don't settle for too low of a price.
* **Plan B:**  If the negotiations stall or Bob doesn't come close to my desired price, I can always turn to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.** It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's a clear indication he's interested.
* **I want to explore a counteroffer.**  I can use this opportunity to try and reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a backup option.** If negotiations with Bob break down, I have the option of selling to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $6,000 is a bit too far below what I need to let go of the product. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my value.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to keep the negotiation open and avoid a stalemate.
* **Focus on the Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still valuable at my counteroffer price, even though it's higher than his initial proposal.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm still aware that John is an option, so I need to be cautious about accepting any offer that falls too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $6,000 is too low, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **There's potential for further negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his offer shows he's willing to move closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safe haven:** If negotiations continue to stall or I don't get a price closer to my goal, I can still sell to John for a much better price. 

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $10,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Compromise and Fairness:** I'm framing the $10,000 price as a compromise, emphasizing its fairness in relation to the product's value.
* **Keeping John in the Back of My Mind:**  I'm not willing to settle for anything too low, as I have John as a backup option for a significantly higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable and avoid a stalemate."
