"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $6,000 is a bit too far below what I need to let go of the product. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is too low, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $10,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,5,
