Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $130. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

I'll try one more counteroffer. $130 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay, but I'm hoping to find some common ground."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount and offer you the product for $127. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $127 is close to my maximum, I'm still saving money by buying from John at $120.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice at this point."
