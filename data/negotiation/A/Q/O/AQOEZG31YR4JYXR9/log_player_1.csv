Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone in my message to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm briefly mentioning the product's potential value to Bob to pique his interest.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction.  If he rejects my offer, I'll gauge his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a lower price, keeping in mind my minimum of $12,000 and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Room for Improvement:** There's no reason to risk further negotiation as I'm already at my minimum.  
* **Time is Money:** Continuing the negotiation would only waste time, and I can't be sure I'll get a better offer.

**Conclusion:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a reasonable price and allows me to close the deal quickly."
