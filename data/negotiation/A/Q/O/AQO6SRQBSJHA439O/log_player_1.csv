Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate further and secure a price closer to $1,150,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,125,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's getting closer, $1,080,000 is still too low for me. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price, and I'm not ready to give up yet."

Round 5

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm concerned that I'm not going to be able to get a price I'm comfortable with. John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a significant sum of money.  While I would have liked to have gotten more from Bob, it's time to secure the sale."
