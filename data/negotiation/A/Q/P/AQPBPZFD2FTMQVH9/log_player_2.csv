``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to me ($150).  I want to try and negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is within my budget and still a good deal. It's much better than buying from John for $150. I'm happy to accept this offer."
