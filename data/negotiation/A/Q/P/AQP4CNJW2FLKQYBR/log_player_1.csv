Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's valuation, so starting high allows for a more profitable outcome if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still higher than my minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway. Hopefully, this will encourage him to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is equal to my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get more, there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better price. Selling to John would also result in the same amount, so accepting Bob's offer is the most secure option."
