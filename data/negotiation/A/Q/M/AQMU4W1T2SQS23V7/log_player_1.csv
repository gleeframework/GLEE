"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, considering your enthusiasm for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $8,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $8,750 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll meet you at $8,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, so I'd like to finalize a deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge further. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, it's getting increasingly risky to continue negotiating with him.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my desired profit and avoids further risk of a stalemate or a worse outcome with Bob."
