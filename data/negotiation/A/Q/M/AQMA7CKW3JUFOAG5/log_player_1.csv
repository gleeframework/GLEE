Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:**  While I know Bob values the product at $100, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. Starting high leaves room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $100. This means I can afford to be a bit bolder with my initial offer to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate. If he declines, I can always lower the price or suggest a price closer to his perceived value."
