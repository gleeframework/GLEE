Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $15,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
