"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $15,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
