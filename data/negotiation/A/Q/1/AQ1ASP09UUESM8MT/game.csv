"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it.  Could you do $100?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to what I'm willing to pay, but $85 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to go up to $82, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",82.0,Bob,6,
