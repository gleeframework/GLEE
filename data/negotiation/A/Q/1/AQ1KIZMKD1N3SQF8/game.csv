"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's worth $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000, which I believe reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I do see the value in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to see if we can reach an agreement.  This still reflects the substantial value of the product.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price. I can see this is a quality product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,287,500. This represents a significant compromise from my side. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
