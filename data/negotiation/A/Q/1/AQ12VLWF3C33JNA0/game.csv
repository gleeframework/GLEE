"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,250 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250.
