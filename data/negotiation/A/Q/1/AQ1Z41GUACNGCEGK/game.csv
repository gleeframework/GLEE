"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to get a fair price. Let me know if you're open to this.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its value to you, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
