"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $10,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me somewhere around $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $17,000 is still quite a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we settle around $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

``` 
This is a good time to accept Bob's offer for the following reasons:

* **Profitable Deal:** $13,000 is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and a decent profit margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiation might push Bob away, while John offers a guaranteed $15,000. Accepting $13,000 now avoids the risk of losing Bob entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means receiving the payment sooner rather than later.
