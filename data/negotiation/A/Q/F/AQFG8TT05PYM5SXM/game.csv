"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get a valuable asset at a fair price, and I'll be able to move it quickly. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure we're getting any closer to a deal at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price given the product's value.  Let's aim for a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",980000.0,Bob,6,
