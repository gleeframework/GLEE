"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a 8.3% markup on my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium right away. If he rejects, I can adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's a 21% discount from my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I won't accept such a drastic reduction. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is still a 4.2% markup from my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer. If he rejects again, I'll need to consider my options more carefully."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,150,000. This is a 8.3% discount from my original offer, but still a 25% markup from my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will realize that he's getting a good deal, and that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I've already made significant concessions, and it's clear he's not serious about reaching a fair price.  I'm running out of time, and it's not worth risking further negotiations. I'll sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
