Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still ensuring Alice gets significantly more than her minimum. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but there might be a slight delay.  Getting Bob to buy quickly at $11,500 could be more advantageous overall."
