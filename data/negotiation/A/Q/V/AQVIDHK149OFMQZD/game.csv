"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to move on with the sale.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $8,750? That's the lowest I can go.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",8900.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. Can you consider $8,700? That's the lowest I can go.",8700.0,Bob,8,
