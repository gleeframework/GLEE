"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be useful, but I have a budget in mind. How about we bring the price down to $6,000? ",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. It sounds like this product could really help you, so let's find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand this product has value, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
