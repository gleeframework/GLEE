I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that aligns with your interests. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $725,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000 is too low, so I will offer $725,000 is too low, so I will offer $740,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000

It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point. Accepting the $740,000 offer is a good compromise and saves a significant amount compared to John's offer."
