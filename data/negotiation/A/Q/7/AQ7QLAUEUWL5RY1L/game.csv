"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  While $1,225,000 is closer, I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $1,150,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
