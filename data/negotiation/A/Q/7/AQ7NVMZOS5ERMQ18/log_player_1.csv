Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's still better than selling to John for $100.  At this point, the negotiations are getting too long, and I'm worried about the risk of Bob getting impatient and walking away."
