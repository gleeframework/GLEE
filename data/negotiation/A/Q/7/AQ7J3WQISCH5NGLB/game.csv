"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a fantastic investment for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That's a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the value this product brings. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I agree the product has value, $1,750,000 is still too steep for me.  How about we try $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to meet for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll be getting.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to stretch to $1,200,000, but that's truly as high as I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
