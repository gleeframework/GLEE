"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price of $150. I need to try and get closer to that, so I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $140.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $135? That's the best I can do, and I really like the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to sell for less than $140. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $135 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference at $137.50. That's a fair compromise that would allow us both to move forward with this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. Can we try $132.50? That's the absolute most I'm willing to pay for this product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of rounds and Bob's offers are consistently below my desired price point. It's better to sell to John at $150 than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or having the negotiation stall completely."
