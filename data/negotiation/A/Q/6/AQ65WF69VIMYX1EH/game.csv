"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product at that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $140.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $135? That's the best I can do, and I really like the product. Can you meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $135 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference at $137.50. That's a fair compromise that would allow us both to move forward with this deal. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. Can we try $132.50? That's the absolute most I'm willing to pay for this product. Can you meet me at that price?",132.5,Bob,8,
