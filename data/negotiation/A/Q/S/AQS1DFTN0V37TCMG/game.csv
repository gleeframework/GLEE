"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $155. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $140. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $140 is still beyond my budget.  I'm going to stick with my original counteroffer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that this product is worth it at that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,6,
