Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob's maximum valuation is $8,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $10,000. Starting with a higher price ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing add a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating its value to Bob, the message hints at the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice may need to adjust her price."
