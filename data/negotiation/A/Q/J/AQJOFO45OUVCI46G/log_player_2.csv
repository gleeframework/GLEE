"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $125 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $125, but I'm looking to pay closer to $100. Would you be willing to go to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $120. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $120 is better than $125, he can likely get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation.  He wants to see if Alice will budge further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $120 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $100.  I'm willing to offer $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $122.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still hoping for a better price. While $122.5 is slightly better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his target range.  He has 5 rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might lower her price again.  He's willing to risk a few more rounds before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $122.50 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to go up to $117.50, which would be right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go below $125. I'll counteroffer at $124. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $124. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $124
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but he's still not comfortable paying $124. He's hoping to get Alice down a little further.  He has 3 rounds left, so he's willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're getting closer.  $124 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a living. I'll counteroffer at $123. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob only has one round left. While he could counteroffer again, he's likely not going to get Alice to go below $123.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $150. It's a bit higher than his desired price, but it's still a better deal than accepting Alice's offer and also saves him the time of another round of negotiation."
