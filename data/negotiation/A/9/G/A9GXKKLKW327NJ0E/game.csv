"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so I'd like to offer $100 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer,  $100 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go a little lower than my last offer, but I need to be at least at $120 to make this work.  This would be a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're open to that.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, so I'd like to offer $110 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",110.0,Bob,6,
