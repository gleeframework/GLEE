{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to make Bob feel valued and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can lower the price a bit in subsequent counteroffers. 
* **John as backup:** The threat of selling to John for $150 provides a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for anything less than $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $80. Accepting would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest. This creates an opportunity to negotiate further and try to secure a better price. 
* **John as a safety net:** The option to sell to John for $150 provides a solid backup, ensuring I won't be forced to accept a price that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $130 to $110. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $110 is still a good deal, emphasizing the product's value and justifying the price. 
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts. 
* **John as backup:**  This counteroffer still keeps me above my minimum price point of $150, ensuring I don't lose out if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so I'd like to offer $100 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer, it's not enough to justify selling.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, and he's already shown a willingness to compromise. This suggests there's still room to push for a better price.
* **John is the backup:**  I'm confident that I can sell to John for $150 if I don't get a better offer from Bob. This provides a safety net, allowing me to continue negotiating with Bob without pressure.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer,  $100 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go a little lower than my last offer, but I need to be at least at $120 to make this work.  This would be a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly, demonstrating that I'm still open to negotiating.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I highlight the fact that $120 is a good price for Bob, making it more appealing and less likely for him to reject.
* **Firm stance:**  I'm not willing to go any lower than $120, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose out if Bob rejects.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a better price, knowing that I can always sell to John for $150 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, so I'd like to offer $110 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's closer, it's not enough to justify selling.
* **Limited negotiation space:** Bob has declared this his final offer.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **John is the safe option:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

I've made several concessions, and Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate. However, his final offer is still below my acceptable range.  Selling to John at this point is the most sensible and profitable choice."
