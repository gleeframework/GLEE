"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $14,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
