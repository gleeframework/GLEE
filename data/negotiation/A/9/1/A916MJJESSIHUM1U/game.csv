"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
