Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $120 (its worth to you), there's a chance Bob might decline. Offering it slightly lower at $115 increases the likelihood of a sale and still nets you a profit.
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By mentioning you're offering it to Bob first at a special price, you create a subtle sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially swaying him to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is firm, the initial message doesn't completely shut down the possibility of Bob countering with a slightly lower price (though you should be prepared to walk away if he goes below $120)."
