"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a starting point. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable offer.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, $6,000 is still a bit low considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. $7,500 is a bit closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to close this deal soon.",8500.0,Alice,5,
