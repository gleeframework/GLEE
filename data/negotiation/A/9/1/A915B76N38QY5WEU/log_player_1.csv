"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product.  
* **Opportunity:** The message emphasizes the opportunity for Bob to gain something valuable.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he's not interested in this price, we can move into negotiation.  I have the safety net of John's offer, which I can always fall back on if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still not a good deal for me considering I can get $1,200,000 elsewhere.
* **Negotiation room:** I have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a more acceptable price within the remaining rounds.  
* **John's offer:**  I don't want to rush into selling to John yet. If I can get a better price from Bob, it's worth continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still higher than his offer. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the limited time we have to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1,400,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,550,000. This would allow me to move forward with the deal, and it's a good price considering the value of the product.  We only have a limited time to finalize this, so let's see if we can find an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, giving me room for further negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's value to justify the price.
* **Time pressure:** I subtly create a sense of urgency by mentioning the limited time. This could encourage Bob to consider my offer more seriously.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully assess if continuing the negotiation is worthwhile or if it's time to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and $1550000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still only able to offer $1500000 at this time. If you're willing to accept that price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a decent deal.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net, it's only $300,000 less than what Bob is offering.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale that's within a reasonable range of my desired price. Given the limited time and the close proximity to my minimum, it's a good risk-reward balance."
