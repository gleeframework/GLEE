"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* A counteroffer of $7,500 is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within the range of a potentially acceptable deal. 
*  This counteroffer allows for negotiation and potentially a middle ground that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $8,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget.
* Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product at the highest price he's willing to pay, saving him nothing but securing the product.
* While rejecting and counteroffering could potentially lead to a lower price, there's a risk of Alice rejecting that counteroffer and potentially reaching a stalemate. 
* There's also the risk of running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at the same price.
* Accepting the offer eliminates these risks and ensures a successful purchase within budget."
