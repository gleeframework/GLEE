"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $950,000? That would make it easier for me to move forward.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $950,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to close this deal.  Let's aim for a win-win situation.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to wrap this up.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  $975,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's aim to reach a final decision this round.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
