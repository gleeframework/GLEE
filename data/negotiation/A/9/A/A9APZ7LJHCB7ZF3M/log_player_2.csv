You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $122.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting the $122.50 offer gets you the product within your budget and saves you $27.50 compared to John's offer."
