{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe it would be a valuable asset. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects its potential value to you while also being fair to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Communicating value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Setting a high price:** Targeting a price close to Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Inviting a response:**  Encouraging Bob to engage in a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but is still significantly lower than the value I believe the product has. **
* **I have room for negotiation. **  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial ask, attempting to bridge the gap.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price higher than $900,000, but lower than $1,000,000, aiming for a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer.  While I recognize the product's value to you, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the product's potential for you, and it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just $20,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk of losing a better deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $800,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, and I may not get a significantly better offer.

**Conclusion:** It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that's close to my minimum, minimizing risk and maximizing potential profit."
