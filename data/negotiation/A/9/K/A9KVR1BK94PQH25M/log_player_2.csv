# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on the budget.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,400,000. This feels like a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to see this product in your hands.
