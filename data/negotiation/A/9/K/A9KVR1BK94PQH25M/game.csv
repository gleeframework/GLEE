"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Its value is significant and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my maximum offer, as it represents the value I place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects its inherent worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high. I'm confident in the product's potential, but I can't justify exceeding my budget. My final offer remains $1,000,000.  If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position on the budget.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,400,000. This feels like a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to see this product in your hands.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in the product. ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $1,300,000?  It's a fair deal that avoids any further back and forth.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
