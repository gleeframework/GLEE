"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $95, which is below your value.
* Buying from John would cost you $100. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves you $5 compared to buying from John."
