"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product, which I believe will be immensely valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong opening offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is still $50,000 below Bob's valuation, providing space for bargaining while staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is above our minimum, we are still in the early stages of negotiation.  We have room to counter and try to secure a price closer to our initial offer. We'll aim to understand Bob's willingness to pay better in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While this product offers immense value, I'm targeting a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $1,120,000? This reflects the true worth of what this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  We're making a smaller concession ($30,000) to signal that we're aiming for a price closer to our original ask.
* **Justifying the Price:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** We phrase our counteroffer as a question (""Would you be willing..."") to encourage a collaborative negotiation rather than a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I need us to find a compromise. Would you be open to $1,095,000? I believe that's a fair offer, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, incrementally increasing his offer. We're still above our minimum, so it's worth pushing a bit further.
* **Assessing Willingness to Pay:**  By continuing to counter, we can gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay for the product.
* **Time Consideration:** We have enough rounds left to negotiate without feeling pressured to accept a less-than-ideal offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,107,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1107500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  We're demonstrating a willingness to compromise by proposing a price directly in the middle of our previous offer ($1,120,000) and his ($1,095,000).
* **Seeking a Quick Close:**  By offering a seemingly equitable split, we aim to expedite the negotiation and reach an agreement quickly. 
* **Maintaining Value Proposition:** We continue to emphasize the product's value to reinforce its worth at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the movement. How about we settle on $1,090,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is still a significant profit ($90,000) over our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to negotiate further, Bob's increases are getting smaller, suggesting we're approaching his limit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a very good profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the earnings sooner rather than later."
