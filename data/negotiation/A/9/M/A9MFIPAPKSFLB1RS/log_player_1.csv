Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value. I'll see if Bob is interested in this price. If not, I can adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still being above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150

Bob's offer of $150 matches my minimum acceptable price and is equal to what John is offering.  There's no need to continue negotiating further.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
