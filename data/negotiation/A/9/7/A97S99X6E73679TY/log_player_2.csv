"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  You can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm offering $75, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget is $100. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to keep trying to negotiate with her and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $80, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price than her previous offer.  This is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still not a great deal. With only 5 rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating and risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with. It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum budget than to gamble and potentially miss out on a purchase."
