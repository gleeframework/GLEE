"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me, though. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we try $700,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000. Let's try $825,000.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  I could maybe do $750,000, but that's really pushing my budget.",750000.0,Bob,6,
