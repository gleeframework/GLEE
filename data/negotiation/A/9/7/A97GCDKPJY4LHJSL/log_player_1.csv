Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,500,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $950,000?  That would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a million, it's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk Bob lowering his offer further or reaching an impasse in negotiations."
