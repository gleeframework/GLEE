"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $85? I'm really interested in purchasing the product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference?  Would you be interested in paying $95 for the product? This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the price of $95. I've done some research and found a similar product for $80 elsewhere. I believe this aligns better with my current financial situation. Thank you for considering my offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
