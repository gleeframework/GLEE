Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so offering it for that price or lower would be selling ourselves short.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $145 is our initial offer, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer. This gives us some wiggle room to potentially still get a price higher than John's offer."
