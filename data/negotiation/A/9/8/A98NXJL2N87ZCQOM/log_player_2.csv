"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since you can get the product from John for $120, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still above what you're willing to pay. Since you can buy from John for $120, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
