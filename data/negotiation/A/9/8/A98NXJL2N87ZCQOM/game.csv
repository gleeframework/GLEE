"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $125 right now. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $132.50 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $128.75? That's a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal.",128.75,Bob,4,
