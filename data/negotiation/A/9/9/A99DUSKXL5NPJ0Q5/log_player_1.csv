"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encouraging. I want to keep Bob engaged and open to negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I briefly highlight the value of the product to Bob, hoping it will make him more willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and try to get as close to my minimum price ($150) as possible. I'll be prepared to negotiate downward if Bob rejects the initial offer. However, I also have the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob stall or if I'm not happy with the offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150.  While it's tempting to take the $120, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price. If negotiations continue to stall, I can always fall back on selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counter-offer of $140, which is halfway between my initial offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $140 is a ""fair price"" considering the product's value. This adds weight to my counter-offer and could make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer but not going below my minimum, I'm aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. I hope that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and be willing to accept.  If not, I'll continue to negotiate in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum price of $150. While it's getting closer, I'm determined to get a price closer to my target. 

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate.  I have several rounds left, and there's still a chance I can get a better offer from Bob. If his offers continue to be too low, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go lower than $145. This is a good deal for both of us.  Think about it - we're almost there!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counter-offer of $145, which is halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($130). This shows a continued willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm reminding Bob that we're ""almost there"" to emphasize that a deal is within reach and encourages him to close the gap.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate that $145 is a ""good deal for both of us"" highlighting the value of the product and appealing to his desire for a fair deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm strategically closing the gap while remaining above my minimum price. The positive and encouraging tone aims to push Bob towards accepting the deal. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate in the following rounds, keeping my minimum in mind and always having the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a final price of $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $140 is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer a bit more, accepting this offer ensures I get at least my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a lost deal.

**Strategy:**

This offer aligns with my goal of maximizing profit while still securing a sale.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $150, accepting this offer ensures a quick sale without the risk of further negotiation."
