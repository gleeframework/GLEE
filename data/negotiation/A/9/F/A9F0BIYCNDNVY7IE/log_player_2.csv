{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it."",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still securing a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 was a bit steep, but I still think this product is worth more than $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved a bit, the price is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $88?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to her price, showing willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a price below $90."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $88, Bob. But I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and $90 is a decent price, saving me $30 compared to John. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
