"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This aligns closely with what I am willing to pay.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise: I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $12,500 for the product. This still aligns closely with what I am willing to pay and represents a compromise from my initial offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - I'll drop my price to $12,750. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll see it as a fair offer. Let's close this deal now.",12750.0,Alice,5,
