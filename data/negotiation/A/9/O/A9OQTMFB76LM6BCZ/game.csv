"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit constrained on my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $9,750 for the product. I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,900 for the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm getting close to my target.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing hard on the price, but $9,900 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,000.  This is a fair price, and it will get us both to where we need to be.  Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,7,
