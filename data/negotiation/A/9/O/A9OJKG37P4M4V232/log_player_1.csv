"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob to hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'm hoping to get closer to the $14,000 I initially offered. I'll counter with a lower price, but still above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum than John's offer, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my initial goal of $14,000. I'll counter with a price a bit higher than Bob's, but still lower than my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $11,500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,500?  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $12,000?  That's a fair price, and it would allow us to close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and while I could sell to John for the same amount, I'm happy to close this deal with Bob."
