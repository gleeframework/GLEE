Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to sell the product for $110, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $125. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While the price of $125 is close to your $120 limit, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. There's no point in risking Alice sticking to her ""final offer"" and losing the chance to buy it from John."
