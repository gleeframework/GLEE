"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable, but I'd need a more competitive price. How about we try something around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I know the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1,050,000? This is a compromise that still brings you a great deal, while also allowing me to recoup some of the value I know the product has for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to find a price point that works better for my budget. I can go up to $925,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product has the potential to be worth it.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in it. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $950,000. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing too much of my margin. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
