Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum and a significant discount from Bob's perceived value ($100). This makes it a tempting offer.
* **Open Communication:**  The message aims to start a conversation and gauge Bob's interest, rather than being a simple take-it-or-leave-it offer."
