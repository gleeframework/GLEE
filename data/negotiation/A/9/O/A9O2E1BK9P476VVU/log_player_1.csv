Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still secure $10,000 from John, which is my safety net. However, I'm hoping to get more, and I believe Bob might be willing to pay a higher price, given the potential value of the product."
