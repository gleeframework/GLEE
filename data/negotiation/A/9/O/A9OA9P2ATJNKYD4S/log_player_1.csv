Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys it from you.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob still sees value in the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It secures you a significant profit above your minimum while leaving Bob with a potential $50,000 gain.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting exclusivity can add perceived value and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Fairness:**  While aiming high, framing the price as ""fair"" and emphasizing ""true worth"" can make it more palatable. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but no less than $1,100,000). 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly more generous offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a lower price might be more enticing.
