Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
