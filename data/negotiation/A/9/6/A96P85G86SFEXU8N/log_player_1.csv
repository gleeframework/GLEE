{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Reasoning:**  $115 is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation if he's willing.
* **Flexibility:**  This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving you the opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives you a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum value of $120. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:**  Rejecting allows me to counter-offer, hopefully reaching a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides security if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $105 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum value. 
* **Appealing to value:**  I emphasize the ""good value"" to Bob to highlight the potential benefit of the deal for him.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  Ending with ""Let's see if we can find common ground"" keeps the conversation open and encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $100, which is the price I'm aiming for. Would you be willing to meet me at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $98 is still below my minimum value of $120. Accepting would result in a loss. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is closer to my desired range, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Safety net with John:**  Rejecting provides the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable price, knowing I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, and I appreciate your persistence.  While $98 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to go down to $102.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** $102 is a further compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I emphasize the word ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of a balanced transaction.
* **Urgency:**  Adding ""Let's try to close this deal"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $99? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:**  $99 is still below my minimum value of $120, and while it's tempting to try for one more counter-offer, it's becoming clear that Bob is not going to budge significantly further.
* **Risk of losing time and profit:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further delays and potentially lower offers from Bob, further eroding my profit margin.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit that meets my minimum requirements and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed profit with John.  While I might have been able to get closer to $102, the risk of further negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential gain."
