"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's find a way to make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.  This is my final offer.  Let's finalize this deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, but $14,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",13000.0,Bob,6,
