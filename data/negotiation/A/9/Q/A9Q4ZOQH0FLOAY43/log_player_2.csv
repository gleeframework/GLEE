Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is now matching John's price, and there's no benefit to further negotiation.  This secures the product at the best possible price."
