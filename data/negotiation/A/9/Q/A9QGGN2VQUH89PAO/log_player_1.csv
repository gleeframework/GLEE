Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
