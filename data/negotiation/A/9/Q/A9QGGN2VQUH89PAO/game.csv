"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $925000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you while also being fair to me.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
