Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the value this product brings. Let's meet halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is a fair price. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  She's consistently staying above the midpoint between your offers. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John with no further negotiation. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal."
