"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its value to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can't justify going that high. How about we bring it down closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000).  I have 8 rounds left and can still negotiate with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is still pushing it for my budget.  I could go to $950,000. That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 6 rounds left and can still negotiate with Bob or sell to John for a higher price. Selling to John would be the optimal solution, but I'm willing to give Bob a few more rounds to see if he'll meet my minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer takes into account your budget and allows us to find a mutually beneficial outcome.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal within the remaining rounds."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
