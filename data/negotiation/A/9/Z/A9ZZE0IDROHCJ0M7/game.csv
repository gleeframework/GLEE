"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can't justify going that high. How about we bring it down closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is still pushing it for my budget.  I could go to $950,000. That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it shows I'm serious about making a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer takes into account your budget and allows us to find a mutually beneficial outcome.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal within the remaining rounds.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
