Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My primary goal is to get as much money as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I need to offer Bob a price lower than that to entice him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob while still ensuring I get a significantly higher price than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message to Bob is framed positively, emphasizing the value of the product without directly mentioning my minimum price. This approach aims to increase the perceived value for Bob and make the offer more appealing."
