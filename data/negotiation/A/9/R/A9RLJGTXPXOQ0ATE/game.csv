"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $725,000.",725000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $650,000, which is $687,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",687500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, you're tough! I respect that. I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to $670,000. This is really my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you say, are we close to a deal?",670000.0,Bob,8,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and I'm willing to consider it a fair deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale.",675000.0,Alice,9,,
