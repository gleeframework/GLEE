I'm going to start high and see if Bob is willing to pay my minimum. If he doesn't, I'll see what counteroffer he makes, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."

I'm going to offer Bob $1,137,500.  This is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and his last offer. I think it's a fair price, and I'm hoping he'll accept it. If he doesn't, I'm starting to get nervous about the potential for losing out on the sale to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1132812}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again. I'm offering $1,132,812, which is the average of my last offer and his.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince him to accept.  If he doesn't, I'm starting to get very concerned about losing this sale."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm starting to feel the pressure. While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a considerable amount of money. I've pushed as hard as I can, and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John.  It's not ideal, but it's the most financially sound decision at this point."
