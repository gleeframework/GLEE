"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" you provide a vague justification for the high price, even though you know it's worth less to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Clearly stating this is an ""initial proposal"" and a ""starting point for negotiations"" signals to Bob that you're willing to have a flexible discussion.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down, the high starting point increases the likelihood of a final price well above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response to this initial offer will provide valuable information about his eagerness and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above your minimum acceptable price, we are still in the early stages of negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Explore Higher Potential:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since his initial offer is already significantly above his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:** Accepting immediately could signal that you're overly eager, potentially leading to Bob offering less in future rounds. 

By rejecting and providing a counteroffer, you maintain control of the negotiation and keep the possibility of a higher final price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is still significantly below my initial assessment of the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $2,000,000? This reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down from $2,300,000 to $2,000,000 shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Holding Firm:** While the price is lower, it's still significantly above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The language encourages Bob to meet you halfway, suggesting that you're open to further discussion but not drastic cuts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly above your minimum price of $1,500,000, representing a healthy profit.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to your asking price. Accepting his ""meet in the middle"" proposal shows good faith.
* **Time Value:** While you could potentially push for more in further rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures a favorable deal and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away."
