Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Appeal to Bob's Value:**  I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, reminding him that it's worth $12,000 to him. This might encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to discuss the price. This makes the offer feel less rigid.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.  I'll always keep in mind my minimum price of $8,000 and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Profit:**  While Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This represents a good profit margin.
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price or a prolonged negotiation process, especially if Bob is firm on his offer.
* **John's Offer:** While I can sell to John for $8,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a higher price.

**Conclusion:**  Given the potential risks of further negotiation, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It secures a good profit without the uncertainty of more counteroffers."
