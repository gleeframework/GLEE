Bob has reached the end of his negotiation rope. While Alice is willing to meet him halfway, it's becoming clear that they won't be able to agree on a price. It's better to buy from John at $12,000 rather than risk going another round with Alice and potentially ending up paying more.  John is a reliable option, and Bob knows exactly how much he'll spend."
