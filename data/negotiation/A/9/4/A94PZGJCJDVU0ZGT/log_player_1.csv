Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves me with a profit. It also gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being squeezed too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, hopefully encouraging him to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not high enough. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal. I'd rather secure the $1,200,000 from John."
