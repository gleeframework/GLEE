Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not sure if the product is worth $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob is clearly willing to go above $900,000.  Holding firm for another round is the best move to try and secure a price closer to $1 million."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I'd like to propose $970,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000

While we could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $970,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
