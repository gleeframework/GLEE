"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move on the price.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to accept $10,000, but that's my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
