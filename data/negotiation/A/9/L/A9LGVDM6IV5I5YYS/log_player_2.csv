Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I can meet you halfway at $130. Is that something you'd be interested in?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high.  How about $115?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I can make that work."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I can offer you a slight discount at $125. That's the lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still too high, even with the discount. At this point, it's getting too close to my limit and I don't want to risk going even higher. I'll go with John's offer, as it's my limit."
