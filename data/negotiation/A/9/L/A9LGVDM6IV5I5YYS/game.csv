"Hello Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm excited to share it with you. My initial offer is $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I can meet you halfway at $130. Is that something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high.  How about $115?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I can make that work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I can offer you a slight discount at $125. That's the lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
