Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I think $95 is a fair price, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate, while still ensuring a good profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback buyer at $80, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer.

By starting with a strong but reasonable offer, you increase the chances of Bob accepting and maximizing your profit."
