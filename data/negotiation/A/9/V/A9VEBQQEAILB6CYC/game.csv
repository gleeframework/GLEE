"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That seems like a reasonable compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000.  My minimum price is $8,000, which reflects the product's value to me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500. This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
