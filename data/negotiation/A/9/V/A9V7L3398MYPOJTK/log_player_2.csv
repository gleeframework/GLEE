"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. I'm willing to go down a little more, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. How about $120?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

$120 is a good price for you, considering John is selling it for $150.  It's also a reasonable compromise with Alice."
