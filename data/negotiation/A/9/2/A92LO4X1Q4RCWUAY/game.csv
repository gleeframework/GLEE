"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I receive a fair return on the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
