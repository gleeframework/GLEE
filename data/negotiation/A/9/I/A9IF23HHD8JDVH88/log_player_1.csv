"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair compromise given Bob's previous offer."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, and John is waiting in the wings if this deal falls through."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $155. This is my final offer. I'm willing to come down to $150, but if Bob doesn't accept this, I'll sell to John."
