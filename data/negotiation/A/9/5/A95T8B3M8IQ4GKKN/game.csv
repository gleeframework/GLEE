"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking for a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $13,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $14,500. It's the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
