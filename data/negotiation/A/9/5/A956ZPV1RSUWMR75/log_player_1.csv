"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential deal while also ensuring I'm getting a good price. I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to create a positive environment for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $112 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $112 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $118? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a significant compromise on my end. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 118}
```

I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that I'm making a compromise. This will hopefully encourage Bob to accept the offer."
