# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,750 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000 for the product. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is coming down in price, $11,000 is still above your budget. You're close to a deal, but you're better off trying to get a lower price and see if Alice will budge.  You've got more rounds and a guaranteed alternative with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,900. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to your budget, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You have two more rounds, but it seems Alice is unwilling to drop below $10,900.  

To avoid further negotiation and potentially losing more time, it's best to go with the guaranteed price from John.  You'll save $900 compared to Alice's final offer, and you'll have more time for other things."
