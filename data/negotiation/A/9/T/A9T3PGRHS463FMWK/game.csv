"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider a price reduction?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm looking for a better deal. How about $15000? I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product. However, $15000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $17000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",17000.0,Alice,5,
