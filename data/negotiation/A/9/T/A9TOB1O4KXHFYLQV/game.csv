"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it, given my budget and the need for further consideration. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $775000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $750000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our discussions and my need to make a sound investment. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
