You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can do $9,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,500. I can do $8,500, which is still a good deal for you, but also reflects the value I think the product has. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  It's better to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
