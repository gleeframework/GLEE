Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,800,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my desired budget and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
