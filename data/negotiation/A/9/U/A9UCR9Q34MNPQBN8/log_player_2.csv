**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $780,000 - $800,000 range.  While we might be able to push her down another $5,000 - $10,000, the risk of her refusing and our alternatives (John at $1,200,000) makes this a reasonable acceptance point.  It's a significant savings compared to John and a decent deal overall."
