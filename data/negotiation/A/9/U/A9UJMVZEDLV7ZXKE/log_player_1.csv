Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product,  which is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.
