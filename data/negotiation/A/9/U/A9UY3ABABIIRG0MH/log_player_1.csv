"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1,750,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,750,000:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum desired price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also opens the door for further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible. By starting high, I leave room to negotiate down. I'm also prepared to walk away to John if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. How about $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum desired price, I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a higher price. I'm not willing to sell for my minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it still offers you great value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,600,000:** This is a compromise price, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's position while reiterating the product's value. It also frames the offer as a compromise and leaves the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a more moderate approach, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I believe this will encourage Bob to accept or come closer to my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1550000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's latest offer.  I have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price, especially since John is offering my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop to $1,575,000.  This reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,575,000:** This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while still keeping the price above Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes a sense of compromise and encourages Bob to close the deal. 

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds left, I'm getting closer to the halfway point and need to be more aggressive while still trying to secure a good price. This offer is a clear compromise that shows I'm serious about making a deal but I'm also still trying to get a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering the negotiations so far, I'd like to propose a final price of $1560000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,560,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,560,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action. Here's why:

* **Getting Closer to My Minimum:**  While it's not my desired price, $1,560,000 is significantly closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Losing More:** If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a risk he might reject my counteroffer and we could end up in a stalemate. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  John is offering my minimum, but I'm not guaranteed to get a better deal with him if I continue to negotiate with Bob.

**Overall:** By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's close to my desired price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
