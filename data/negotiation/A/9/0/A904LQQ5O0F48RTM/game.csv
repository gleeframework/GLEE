"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2000000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe the product's value will be worth it for your business in the long run. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1650000.  This is my final offer before I have to explore other options.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1750000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1700000.  This is my final offer before I have to seriously consider other options.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1725000? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the product's value.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1725000 is still outside my budget. Let's aim for a final compromise at $1675000. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1675000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1692500? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1692500.0,Alice,9,
