Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't possible in a real negotiation:**  In a real-world scenario, Alice wouldn't know Bob values the product at $8,000. This response is crafted for the given exercise, but a more realistic approach would involve researching market value and comparable products.
* **Starting high leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it establishes a high anchor point. This gives Alice the flexibility to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than $10,000. 
* **Alternative buyer provides leverage:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position.  She doesn't need to desperately sell to Bob.
* **The message is framed positively:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob and positioning the offer as exclusive can make it more appealing."
