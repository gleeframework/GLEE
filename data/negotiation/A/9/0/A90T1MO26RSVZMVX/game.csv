,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $60? I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $60 is quite low for the value of this item.  Could you meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which was $60. Would you consider $75? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",75.0,Bob,4,
