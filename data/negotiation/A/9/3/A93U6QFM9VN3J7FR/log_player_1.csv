Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but not at the maximum to give room for negotiation. This offer is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we settle at $975,000? It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $975,000 is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can push for a little more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs. It's a good compromise that ensures we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again.  The gap between our positions is narrowing, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."
