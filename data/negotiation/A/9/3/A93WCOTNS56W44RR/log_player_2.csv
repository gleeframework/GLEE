"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a decent price, you can potentially do better.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to compromise. How about $110?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within your budget and a good deal considering you're willing to pay up to $120.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price, so accepting this offer is the best choice."
