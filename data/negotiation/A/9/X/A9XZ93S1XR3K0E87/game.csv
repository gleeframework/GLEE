"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good value, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not sure that's the best value for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm not sure if you're really serious about getting this product.  $825,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm coming down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $875,000 is the best value for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle here.",825000.0,Bob,6,
