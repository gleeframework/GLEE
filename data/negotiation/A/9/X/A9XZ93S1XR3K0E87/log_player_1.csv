"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $850,000 is still a bit below my minimum value for the product. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good value, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not sure that's the best value for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm aware that I'm running out of rounds, $825,000 is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a price that is closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm not sure if you're really serious about getting this product.  $825,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm coming down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $875,000 is the best value for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. I've reached a point where it's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk another round with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
