Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to me and I'm willing to pay a small premium for it."

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get it down to $80."

I'm now offering $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay and also the price John is selling it for. This is my final offer, and if Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John."
