**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving in smaller increments and is unlikely to reach a price that significantly exceeds his current offer. While we could continue negotiating, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of Bob's offers dropping further or the negotiations stalling completely. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and avoids further time investment in an uncertain negotiation."
