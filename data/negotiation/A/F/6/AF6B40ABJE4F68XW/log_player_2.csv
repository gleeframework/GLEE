"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price and potentially save even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob can try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000,  to potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we settle on $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise and would allow both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,337,500.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,337,500 is within Bob's budget and a relatively good deal considering he has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000.  Further negotiation could potentially save Bob some money, but there's a risk that Alice will reject the offer and Bob might end up buying from John.  It's a calculated risk, but accepting the current offer ensures a purchase and a relatively good price."
