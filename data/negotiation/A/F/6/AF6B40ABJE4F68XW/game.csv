"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.  How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we settle on $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise and would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,337,500.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
