"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $150, considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to pay more than $100, which is the exact amount John is offering.  There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob when I can get my minimum desired price from John without further delay."
