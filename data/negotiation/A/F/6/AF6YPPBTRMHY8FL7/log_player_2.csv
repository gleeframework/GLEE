Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:

At this point, you're very close to your budget but Alice is unlikely to go lower. You can buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000, which is a better deal than the current offer."
