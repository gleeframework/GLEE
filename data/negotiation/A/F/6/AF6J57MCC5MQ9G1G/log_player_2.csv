"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12000 to you, and we're willing to negotiate a fair price. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. My counteroffer is $10800 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $10,500. It's also significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and secure the product. While he could continue negotiating, the risk of further rounds potentially ending with a higher price or losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars."
