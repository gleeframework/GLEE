"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This initial offer aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting high leaves room for negotiation.
* **Be realistic:** $950,000 is still significantly less than the product's worth to Bob. 
* **Signal confidence:** It shows that I believe in the product's value. 

I'm open to adjusting my offer based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. However, I'll always keep in mind that I can walk away and sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with $950,000.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).**  Selling to John would be a better option at this point. 
* **However, there are 8 rounds remaining.** This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Bob.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I'm not desperate to sell.** It also allows me to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap and keeps the negotiation moving. 

I'll proceed to Round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product to you.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I signal that I am not desperate to sell.
* **Bridge the gap:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Highlight the value to Bob:** I remind Bob of the value the product holds for him, hoping to persuade him to compromise.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching a deal within the limited rounds. I remain open to further negotiation, but I will not go below $850,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John for $800,000, depending on the remaining rounds and the likelihood of securing a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too high. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).**  Selling to John would only net me a small amount more.
* **We have already gone through four rounds of negotiation.**  Time is running out, and there's a risk of not reaching a deal with Bob. 
* **Bob's offer is a good compromise.** It demonstrates his willingness to meet me halfway, and I believe we can still finalize the deal.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profit and avoid the potential of losing out on the deal entirely."
