"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $2,300,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.  Let me know your thoughts.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However,  $2,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I recognize your interest in finding common ground. I'm willing to consider $1,950,000 as a sign of good faith. This offer stands for this round only, as I do have other potential buyers.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to offer $1,850,000.  This represents a significant step forward and shows my commitment to finding a deal.  What do you say?",1850000.0,Bob,6,
