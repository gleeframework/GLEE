{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $8,000 (your guaranteed price from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  To maximize profit, you should aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation. Offering it at $11,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer anticipates potential counter-offers from Bob.  
* **Relationship:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit in a single transaction. If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower initial offer might be considered."
