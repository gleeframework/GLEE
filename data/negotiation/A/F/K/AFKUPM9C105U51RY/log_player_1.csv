"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'm also mindful of the fact that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $13,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
