"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. This price reflects the product's value and still allows you a good margin for profit.  ",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $760,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I can accept.  ",800000.0,Alice,5,
