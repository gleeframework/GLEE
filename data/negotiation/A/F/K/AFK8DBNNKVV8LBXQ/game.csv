"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9500? That's the highest I can go right now.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget to consider. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $10200? That's a fair compromise and much closer to my budget. Let me know if that works for you.",10200.0,Bob,4,
