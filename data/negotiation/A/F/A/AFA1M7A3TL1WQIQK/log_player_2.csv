"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a valuable product for less than you'd pay elsewhere, and I can get the transaction done quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject the offer. I can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is a better deal for me.
