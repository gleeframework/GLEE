"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product. I'm open to further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. I've already factored in considerable flexibility in my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's inherent worth while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm comfortable offering $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
