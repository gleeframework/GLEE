```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, it's clear she's holding firm around the $850,000 mark.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get her much lower, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. Taking the sure savings of $50,000 makes more sense than risking those savings for a potentially small additional discount from Alice."
