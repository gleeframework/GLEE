"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we try $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we settle on $10,250? It's getting close to your target, and I'm willing to meet you there. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  I can offer $9,500, but that's as high as I can go.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's the original price we agreed upon, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
