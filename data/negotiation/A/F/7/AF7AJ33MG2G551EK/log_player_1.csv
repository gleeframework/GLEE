"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'm hoping to get Bob to bite, but if he rejects, I can always use John as a safety net.  Let's see what Bob's counteroffer is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I think I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference with Bob.  He's shown he's willing to pay close to my desired price, so I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of ending up with John's lower offer."
