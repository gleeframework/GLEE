Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers ready."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""other potential buyers,"" Alice creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $800,000, it doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more if he perceives it as a unique opportunity.  

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to negotiate. This initial offer is ambitious, but her fallback option (John) ensures she doesn't lose out on the $800,000 minimum."
