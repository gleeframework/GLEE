{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, as it's well below its true value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's high value to me, creating a sense of urgency and making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is still below my minimum, but high enough to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Plan B:** I'm always prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but that price is a little high for me. I could consider something closer to $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than Bob's own perceived value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  There's a clear gap between our positions, but it's worth continuing negotiations to try and reach a mutually agreeable price.  

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I can accept.  Given the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly pressuring him to move closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation going.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed. If he rejects, I'll assess my options:
* **Counteroffer Again:** I can continue to adjust my offer based on Bob's responses.
* **Sell to John:** If I feel the negotiations are going nowhere, I'll sell to John for my minimum price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer than before, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, so he's clearly trying to get a bargain.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm not willing to sell for that price, but there's still room for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer again.  I'll need to carefully consider my next move, keeping in mind Bob's increasing resistance and my desire to maximize my profit. I might offer a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but I won't go below $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle once more - I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a halfway point between my previous offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,150,000).  
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I highlight the fact that this is a significant reduction from my initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Final Push:**  This offer is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's getting closer to a potentially acceptable price for him.  I'm aiming to reach a deal without having to sell to John.

**Next Steps:** 
* **Accept or Reject:** If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* **Last Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will consider making one last counteroffer. If he rejects that as well, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
