# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, as it's well below its true value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I can accept.  Given the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle once more - I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 price."
