Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 (from John) if Bob declines.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Profit Potential:** There's a potential $300,000 profit margin to negotiate within (Bob's $1,500,000 valuation minus your $1,200,000 minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases the chances of him accepting.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The language is framed positively, highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition.""  It also subtly acknowledges Bob's potential gains by mentioning ""benefits it holds for your specific needs.""
* **Price:** $1,450,000 leaves Bob with a perceived $50,000 gain while securing you a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, you have room to negotiate down slightly while still remaining above your $1,200,000 safety net."
