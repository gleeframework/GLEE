"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be interested in buying the product at this price since it's still significantly lower than its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a good deal, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. $1,350,000 is a good compromise, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. I'll counteroffer Bob again in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John. $1,250,000 is a significant amount for both of us, and I believe Bob is likely to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. While I would prefer to sell to Bob,  John's offer is still a good deal, and it's time to move on."
