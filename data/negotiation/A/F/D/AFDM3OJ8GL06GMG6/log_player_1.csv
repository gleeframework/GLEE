Round 2
Bob's offer:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,100,000 is a strong deal at this stage. It's significantly more than John's offer and keeps the negotiation moving at a good pace. Bob is clearly demonstrating his interest and willingness to meet closer to my price range."
