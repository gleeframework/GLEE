"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point. I know the product is worth more to me than to Bob, but I'm hoping to get a good price by starting high and then being willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though it's getting closer to my minimum, I think there's still room for negotiation.  It's risky, but I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,450,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that this compromise will encourage Bob to accept the deal, as we're both getting closer to finding a price we can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell to John.  While I would love to get a higher price from Bob, we're getting close to my minimum, and there are only 4 rounds left. The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high - I could end up with a price lower than John's offer. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
