Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price higher than your minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob and your risk tolerance, you could adjust the offer price."
