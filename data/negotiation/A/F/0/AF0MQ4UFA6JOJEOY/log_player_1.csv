Round 2

Round 6

**Reasoning:** Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet even close to the $10,000 minimum you're willing to accept.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and you risk losing a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure a sure thing."
