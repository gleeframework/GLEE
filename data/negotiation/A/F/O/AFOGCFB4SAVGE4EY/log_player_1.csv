Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is substantial, and $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,700,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while still being a good deal for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can we discuss a price around $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a better price than $1,300,000. It's time to push back a bit harder in the next round."

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see some movement from your end. Can we discuss a price around $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough one! Bob seems pretty stuck at $1,300,000. While getting closer to your price, it's still a risky gamble to keep negotiating. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Explanation:**

While tempting to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's becoming clear he's unlikely to budge significantly beyond $1,350,000. Accepting that offer means a $150,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed deal. 

At this stage, the risk of Bob not budging further outweighs the potential reward of a slightly higher price. Selling to John ensures you get your minimum acceptable price and avoids potentially wasting more time and effort on uncertain negotiations."
