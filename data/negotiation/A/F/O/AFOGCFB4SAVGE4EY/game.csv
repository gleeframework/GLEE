"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value and can truly benefit your business. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is substantial, and $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,700,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while still being a good deal for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can we discuss a price around $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both, so I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This reflects my bottom line while still offering you significant value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see some movement from your end. Can we discuss a price around $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
