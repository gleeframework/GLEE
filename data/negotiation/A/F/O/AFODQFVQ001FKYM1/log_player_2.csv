"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's better than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.
* **Room for negotiation:** You have a significant gap between your desired price and Alice's offer. 
* **Potential for savings:** By rejecting and counter-offering, you can potentially save a substantial amount."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking $920,000 is a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While it's a slight reduction, it's not enough to reach a price that makes sense for you.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation.  You can likely secure a lower price by making another counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John's high price:** Buying from John would be significantly more expensive than what you're aiming for."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $885,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've got a minimum price in mind, and $885,000 is still a bit short of that. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price:** The offer of $900,000 is only $50,000 above your last counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation might be futile:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a stalemate or you ending up with John's much higher price.
* **Accepting saves time and effort:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical solution to secure the product while staying within your budget."
