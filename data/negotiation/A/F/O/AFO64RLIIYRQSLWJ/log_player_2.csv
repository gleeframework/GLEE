It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:**  While you could try to negotiate further, Alice seems firm at $12,500 and has even presented it as her final offer. 
* **Savings:** You're still getting a $2,500 discount compared to John's price.
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  If you push too hard and Alice walks away, you'll have to buy from John at the higher price."
