Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that high of a price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I still think $1,200,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his current offer, and continuing the negotiation risks a lower final price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safest option to secure the minimum desired value."
