"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that high of a price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $800,000. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I still think $1,200,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
