"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have the option to get the product from John for a lower price, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value our potential deal,  $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, as you've stated the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, her offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as you have the option to buy from John at your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal immediately."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $1,000,000 is a fair price, but I'm really hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  Would you consider $1,025,000?  It's only a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it would make this a truly mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she is still above your desired price point.  While $1,025,000 is tempting, you've already had four rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely she will come down further.  You have the option to buy from John at your maximum budget, so it's the safest and most efficient option to close the deal now."
