"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value our potential deal,  $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, as you've stated the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal immediately.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $1,000,000 is a fair price, but I'm really hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  Would you consider $1,025,000?  It's only a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it would make this a truly mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
