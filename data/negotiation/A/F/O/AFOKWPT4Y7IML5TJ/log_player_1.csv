Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal immediately.
