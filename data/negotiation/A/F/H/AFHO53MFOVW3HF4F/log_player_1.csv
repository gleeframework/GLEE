Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $2,000,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price, I start with a significantly higher offer to explore his maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $2,000,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to lower the price slightly while still securing a significant profit.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""exceed your expectations"" aims to increase the perceived value of the product in Bob's mind. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the safety net of John's offer."
