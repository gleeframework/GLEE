"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is outside my budget. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,250,000, which is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,
