"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $975,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to make a significant purchase.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but I need to get a better deal than that. Can you consider $920,000?",920000.0,Bob,6,
