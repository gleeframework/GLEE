"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
