Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $115, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I can do $112.50, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $112.50 is the best we've gotten so far and it's within our budget. While we could try to negotiate further, we're nearing the middle ground and running the risk of losing the deal. It's a good deal for both of us and we should accept it."
