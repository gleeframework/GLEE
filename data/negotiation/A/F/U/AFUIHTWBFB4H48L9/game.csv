"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth every penny. However, I'm willing to make a good deal for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, this is your last chance to get the product at this price.",8000.0,Alice,3,
