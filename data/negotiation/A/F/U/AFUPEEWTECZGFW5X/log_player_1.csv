Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your $10,000 valuation.
* **Perceived Value:** A higher initial offer can sometimes create a perception of higher value in the buyer's mind. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
