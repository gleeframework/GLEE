"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will get by emphasizing it's worth more to him.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while still leaving space to potentially raise the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's more than what you value it at. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but I want more.**  $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **I'm confident in getting a better deal.** I have 8 rounds remaining and Bob clearly sees the value of the product.
* **I'm not desperate to sell.**  While $8,000 from John is a safe option, I can potentially get more from Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  $9,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm increasing the price slightly to $9,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product for both of us to encourage him to agree.
* **Urgency:** I'm using language like ""close this deal"" to subtly increase the pressure on Bob to accept."
