Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to potentially make a profit.  It's also reasonable enough that Bob might be willing to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my minimum value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum value of $120, $90 is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's initial offer of $85 and closer to my counteroffer of $92.50. It also avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for $120."
