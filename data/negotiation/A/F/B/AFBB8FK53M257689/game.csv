"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $10,000?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,250. I think this is the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit.",11250.0,Alice,5,
