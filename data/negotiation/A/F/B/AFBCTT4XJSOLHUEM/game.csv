"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to pay $88 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $88, so I'll offer you $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,5,
