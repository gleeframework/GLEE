"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It leaves little room for negotiation below my $12,000 limit. I will try to negotiate a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?  I believe that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Reasonable:** While low, my offer is still within a potentially acceptable range for Alice, considering her product's value to her.  I want to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind John's offer of $12,000 as my fallback option if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,500? This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is better, but it's still above my $12,000 limit and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower, especially since I'm only $500 off.
* **Fallback Option:** Having John's offer gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept a price above my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price exactly halfway between our last two offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the size of my increase and my commitment to the purchase, I'm hoping to make the offer more appealing to Alice.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps me below my $12,000 limit while still leaving room for potential minor adjustments in later rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $12,000. It's a fair price that's closer to both of our positions. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price Met:** Alice's offer of $12,000 matches both my target price and John's offer. 
* **No Need to Push Further:**  Since I've reached my goal, there's no benefit in trying to negotiate a lower price. I might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Accepting now ensures I get the product at the desired price."
