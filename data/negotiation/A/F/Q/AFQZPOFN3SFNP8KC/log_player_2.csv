"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are 10 rounds, so there is time to work towards a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has made a concession, $1,100,000 is still significantly above my ideal price point.  I'm going to counter with a lower offer again to see if we can close the gap. It's better to try and get a better deal before potentially having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right in the middle of our valuations. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,150,000. This is a tough ask, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still above my ideal price point and too close to John's price for my liking. I'm going to counter with another lower offer, hoping to bridge the gap. We still have a few rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,080,000. This is a tough ask, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, and $1,080,000 is getting very close to my ideal price point.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and accepting it ensures I get the product without having to resort to buying from John at a much higher price.  We only have a few rounds left, so accepting this offer is the best course of action."
