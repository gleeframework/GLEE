"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right in the middle of our valuations. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,150,000. This is a tough ask, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,080,000. This is a tough ask, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
