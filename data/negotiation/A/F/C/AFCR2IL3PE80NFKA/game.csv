"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant discount, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I'm confident it will bring significant returns to your business.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000. If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad to see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,210,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair value for the product.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
