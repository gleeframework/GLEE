"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,500, I'm hoping we can reach a price closer to my value of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round.  I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8,900.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us to both come to an agreement.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping we can reach a price closer to $9,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
