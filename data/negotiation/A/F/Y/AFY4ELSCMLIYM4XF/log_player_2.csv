"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering. There are still 9 rounds remaining to negotiate, and Bob can use this time to try and get the price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, and Bob can try to chip away at Alice's asking price until he reaches a price that's closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still trying to save as much as possible. There are 5 rounds left, and Bob has a good chance to push for a lower price. He can counter-offer with a price closer to his target of $8,000 and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8,900.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us to both come to an agreement.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both getting closer. Let's see if we can finalize this. I'm willing to lower my price to $9,100. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a great investment for you.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, the negotiations are getting close, but Alice is still unwilling to go below $9,000. Bob has a better option: buy from John for $8,000. This guarantees Bob the lowest price and ensures he doesn't need to continue negotiating with Alice. While a bit more could be saved by continuing the negotiation, the risk of not closing a deal at all outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
