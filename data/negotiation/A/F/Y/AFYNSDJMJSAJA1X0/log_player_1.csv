"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and potentially encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his seriousness and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while also keeping the value of the product high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous one, which is right at the edge of my acceptable range.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
