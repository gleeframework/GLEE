"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture as much of the potential value as possible. This will give Bob room to negotiate down, but it also sets the starting point in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still lower than what I could get from John. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit. I believe that a price of $1,100,000 is reasonable, considering the value of the product to both of us.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate further, but it also shows I'm serious about striking a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still within my negotiation range and can potentially get a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can close the gap further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a profitable deal. I believe that $1,050,000 is a fair price, given the value of the product to both of us.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and I'm confident that we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $980,000 is getting very close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for the full $1,000,000 in the next round.  I'm running out of time, but I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay.  This gives Bob a chance to close the deal and still get a good value for the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire and time is running out. While $990,000 is close to my minimum, I can't afford to risk losing the deal with John. I've reached my limit with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and secures the sale."
