Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Showing Value:**  My message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've framed my message in a way that suggests I'm open to discussion and negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the door open for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While $100 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth to Bob (he values it at $150). 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for me to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point by rejecting this offer and counter-offering.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John for $80 would be a last resort. I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $110 is still a great deal for him, considering he values the product at $150. 
* **Openness:** My message is framed in a way that encourages further discussion and potentially leads to a final agreement.

This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the need to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $105 is only $5 away from my initial counteroffer of $110.  It's a good compromise and puts me very close to my desired price point.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer. He might walk away, and I would be left with only the $80 offer from John.
* **Time Consideration:** Each negotiation round takes time and energy. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other opportunities.

While I could try to push for a higher price, the potential for a successful outcome is diminishing. Accepting Bob's offer at $105 secures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
