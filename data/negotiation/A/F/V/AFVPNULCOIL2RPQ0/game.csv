,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth more than that to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $12,500. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm still interested in buying it from you, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
