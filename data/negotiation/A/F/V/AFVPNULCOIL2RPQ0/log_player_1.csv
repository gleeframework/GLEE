{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm willing to compromise and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a fair price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also far less than the value the product holds to him, which gives me room to counteroffer and still make a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth more than that to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $12,500. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm still interested in buying it from you, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  There's a chance Bob might not budge, and I could end up selling to John for $12,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids any potential loss."
