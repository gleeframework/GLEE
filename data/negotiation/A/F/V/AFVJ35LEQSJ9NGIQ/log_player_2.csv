{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,250, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  Let's finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been diligently trying to negotiate a lower price but Alice's final offer is still above his $10,000 limit. Given the limited rounds remaining, it's in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product at his desired price point and avoids further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
