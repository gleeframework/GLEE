"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,250, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  Let's finalize this.",10500.0,Alice,5,
