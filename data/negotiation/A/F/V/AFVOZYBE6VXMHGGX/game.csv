,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad to hear you're still interested. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to think about the value this product brings to you. How about we meet at $10800?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $9500, which would be $10500. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you accept this price?",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to reach a final agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11500. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to think about the value this product brings to me. How about we meet at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,9,
