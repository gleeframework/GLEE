"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $925,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to meet halfway.  $887,500 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $900,000?
