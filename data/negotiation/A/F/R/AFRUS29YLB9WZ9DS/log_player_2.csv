"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it makes sense to accept her offer. There's no benefit in rejecting and going to John, as you'll end up paying the same amount."
