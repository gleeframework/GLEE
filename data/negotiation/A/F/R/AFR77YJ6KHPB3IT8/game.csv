"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a product worth $1,500,000 to you for a lower price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,375,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're pushing for the lowest possible price, but I'm still confident in the value of this product.  $1,300,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go a bit lower to make this deal work, but I need to be at $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000, which is my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to commit to purchasing it at this price. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
