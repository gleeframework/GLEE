Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum goal of $15,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my goal, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $11,000.  I'll see if I can convince Bob to go a little higher with another counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are getting too close to my minimum threshold. I'm concerned that I'm not going to be able to get a price that's satisfactory for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on the $15,000 deal with John.  It's time to move on."
