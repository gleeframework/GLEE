"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. By starting at $8,500, he aims to bridge the gap between his desired price and Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still wants to try and save more. He is willing to pay $8,500 and Alice is willing to accept $9,000, so there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there at $9,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $8,750.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that is exactly halfway between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's current offer of $9,000. This shows that he is willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway, but he is also standing firm on his desire to pay a price closer to his desired $8,500. This approach is likely to appeal to Alice, as it shows that Bob is serious about negotiating a fair price."
