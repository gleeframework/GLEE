Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to compromise.

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Profitable:** It's still a significant profit margin above my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations risks him lowering his offer or walking away. John's offer is a guaranteed $1,200,000, but the extra $100,000 from Bob is worth the slight risk.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A deal today is better than a potential deal (even a slightly better one) in the future."
