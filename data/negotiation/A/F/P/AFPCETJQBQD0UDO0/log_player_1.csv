Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can always come down a bit, especially knowing your fallback option.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. However, given the potential for a higher profit, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
