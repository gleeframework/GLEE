Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That's a fair price that leaves us both happy."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $10,250, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is a fair compromise and within my acceptable range.  It's also worth noting that if I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing him as a buyer altogether, potentially forcing me to sell to John for $12,000.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
