"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150, and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's the best option to accept her offer. Buying from John would cost you the same, so there's no benefit in rejecting Alice's offer."
