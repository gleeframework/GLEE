Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with the full value of the product to Bob ($1,200,000). This is my ideal outcome. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While I'm starting high, I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" and inviting Bob to discuss. This avoids making it seem like a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.
* **John as a Backup:** By mentioning John, I'm subtly hinting that I have other options and I'm not desperate for Bob's deal. This can help encourage Bob to negotiate.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less for the product.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Not Desperate:**  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not desperate to sell at a loss. John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating. I will counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap without selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,150,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving from my initial $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Clear Bottom Line:**  I'm stating my ""absolute bottom line"" to avoid further back-and-forth. This makes it clear that I'm serious about this price.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing this as a ""deal-closing"" price, encouraging Bob to take the offer and avoid further negotiation. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go to $1,125,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations.  I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'm not thrilled with the price, it's possible that rejecting this offer and counter-offering could lead to more back-and-forth, ultimately wasting time. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance that I might be able to get a slightly higher price by continuing negotiations. However, there's also a risk that Bob might walk away or John's offer might expire. 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option at this point. It secures a sale that's close to my minimum, and minimizes the risk of a deal falling through."
