Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, giving you room to negotiate if needed.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so this price leaves room for him to feel he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a strong opening:** This demonstrates your confidence in the value of your product while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price. I believe I can likely get closer to my target of $11,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a fantastic deal for you, and it's a price I feel comfortable with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This shows willingness to negotiate and compromise.
* **Still above your minimum:** $10,500 is still significantly above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you are making a profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still a gap between your offer and Bob's, allowing for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or a stalemate makes accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 the best option. This ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
