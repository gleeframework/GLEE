,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
