Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $13,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $13,200 for the product. This would allow us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $13,200 is a good price, and it's getting close to my desired price. It's also better than selling to John, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
