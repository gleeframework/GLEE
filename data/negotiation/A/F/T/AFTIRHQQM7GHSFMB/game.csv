,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $95. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with John's offer.  ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $110 to make it worth my while. Can we meet at $107.50? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a good compromise.",107.5,Alice,5,
