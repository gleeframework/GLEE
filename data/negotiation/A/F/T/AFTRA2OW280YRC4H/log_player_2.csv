Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth every penny. Would you like to make this investment in enhancing your experience? If so, I propose a special introductory price of $75 for you today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75.

Alice's offer of $75 is less than your maximum budget of $80 and also cheaper than buying from John. This saves you money and achieves your goal."
