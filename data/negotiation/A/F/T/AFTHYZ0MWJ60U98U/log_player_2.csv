"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely negotiate a better price with Alice.  By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can explore if Alice is willing to lower her price."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price with Alice.  He's shown that he's willing to pay more than his initial offer, but there's still room to compromise."
