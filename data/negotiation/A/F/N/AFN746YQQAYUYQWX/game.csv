"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but $12,000 is a bit steep.  Could we settle around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  To be honest, my budget caps out at $9000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting closer!  I'd be happy to split the difference between our last two offers - would you do $9250?",9250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll offer it to you for $9,700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9700.0,Alice,7,
