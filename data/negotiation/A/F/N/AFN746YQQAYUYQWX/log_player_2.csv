Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $9,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll offer it to you for $9,700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation and Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $9,700 offer secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of missing out completely by going another round."
