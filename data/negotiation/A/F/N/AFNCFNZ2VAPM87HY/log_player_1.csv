Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. However, it's still a reasonable price that might entice him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge from his $100 offer. I've already made a counteroffer, and he's still not budging. It's not worth risking further negotiation, as I could potentially lose more time and still end up selling to John for the same price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
