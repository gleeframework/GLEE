Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than my initial offer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell it to you for $110.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $105 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
