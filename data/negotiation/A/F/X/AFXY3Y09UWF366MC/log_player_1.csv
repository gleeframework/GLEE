Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob with the impression that there's potential for a good deal if he plays his cards right."

Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his previous offer, and I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price, so it's best to secure this deal now."
