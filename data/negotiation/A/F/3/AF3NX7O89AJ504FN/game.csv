"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $16,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $12,000 is cutting it too close. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. Your last offer is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is a fair deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
