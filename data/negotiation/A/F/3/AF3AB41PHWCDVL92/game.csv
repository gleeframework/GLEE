"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only offer $850000 at this time. It's the highest I can go, given my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the immense value this product can bring to your business and is still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value it offers both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 isn't quite there yet. Given the product's potential and the significant benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to compromise further and offer it for $1000000. This is my final offer, reflecting the minimum value I can accept.  Let's finalize this deal and unlock its true potential.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
