"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. Could you do $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $135.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
