"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Beginning with a significantly lower counter-offer allows room for negotiation. While $8,000 is a big difference, it leaves space to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Polite & Direct:**  The message is respectful of Alice's time and clearly states your price limit without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice met you halfway, the price is still above your ideal budget and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This offer shows Alice you're willing to compromise but are still aiming for a price closer to your budget. 
* **Justification:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Alice to see it positively.
* **Alternative in Mind:** You're still below your maximum and have John's offer as a backup if Alice remains inflexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and the difference is now only $500. While you could try to negotiate further, John's offer guarantees you the product at your target price. It's not worth the risk of Alice refusing further negotiation."
