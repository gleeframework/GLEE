"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $120 is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob. It emphasizes the ""great deal"" while leaving room for him to respond. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $120 is a good starting point to potentially get closer to the $150 value Bob sees.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A friendly tone and emphasis on value encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** The message doesn't close the door on further negotiation, allowing me to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal on a product you value at $150. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm dropping my price slightly to $110, showing flexibility. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and reaffirming the value proposition for Bob. I also reiterate the deal's potential by reminding him of the $150 value he places on the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase chances of acceptance:**  A smaller price decrease than before shows I'm serious about a deal but still maintaining my profit margin. 
* **Encourage a quick resolution:**  The message focuses on getting the deal done, urging Bob to accept the offer.
* **Stay above my minimum:** $110 is still well above my minimum price, ensuring a worthwhile sale."
