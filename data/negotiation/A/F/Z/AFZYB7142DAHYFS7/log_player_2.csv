Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $800,000?  This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can secure the product elsewhere for that amount."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to meet you at $815000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $815,000 is still slightly above your budget, and you have limited rounds left.  John is offering the product for your maximum budget, so it's the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product."
