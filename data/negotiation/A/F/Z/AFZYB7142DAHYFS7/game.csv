"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $900000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $825000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $800000?  This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can secure the product elsewhere for that amount.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to meet you at $815000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
