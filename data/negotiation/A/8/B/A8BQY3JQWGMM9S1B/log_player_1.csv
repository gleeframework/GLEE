"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value is $80.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but also want to avoid driving Bob away immediately.  Let's see how he reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a decent price, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this price is fair and might be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92. While it's still a little below my initial goal, it's a good price and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to push for a higher price, especially with the option of selling to John for $80 always available."
