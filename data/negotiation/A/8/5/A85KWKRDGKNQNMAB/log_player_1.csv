Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,450,000 is a significant amount that reflects the product's value, making it more likely for Bob to consider seriously.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and perceive missing out as a loss. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob justifies this calculated risk."
