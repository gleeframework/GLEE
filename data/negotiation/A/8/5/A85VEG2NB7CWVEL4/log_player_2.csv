"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still quite high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts off the negotiation with a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below our $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down in price, it's still above our ideal price point and what John is offering. We'll counter to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,600? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9600
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to Alice's price, but staying firm below $10,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $10,000 is the lowest I can go. That's the minimum I need to make it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to our ideal price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation since we can buy it for the same price from John. Accepting now ensures we get the product without risking further negotiation."
