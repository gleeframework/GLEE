"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that $1,300,000 is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and its market value. This offer reflects my serious interest in purchasing the product, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
