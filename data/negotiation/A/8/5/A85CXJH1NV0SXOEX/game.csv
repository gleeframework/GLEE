"While I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in the product and willing to pay $1,150,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. ",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I have to consider my own investment and expenses. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,200,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
