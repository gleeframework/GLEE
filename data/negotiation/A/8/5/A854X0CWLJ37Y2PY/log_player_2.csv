"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the maximum you're willing to pay is $120, and Alice's initial offer is $120, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate, but it's still within a range where you might be able to close the deal.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good price.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice getting stubborn or the negotiation dragging on.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk missing out on a good product."
