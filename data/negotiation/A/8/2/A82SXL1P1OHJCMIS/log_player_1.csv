Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate, which strengthens our position."
