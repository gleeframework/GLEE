This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still allows for some potential negotiation. I've chosen to leave room for a counteroffer, while also positioning myself to still get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,100,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 1175000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum and further negotiation might risk losing him as a buyer.  It's better to secure the deal at this point."
