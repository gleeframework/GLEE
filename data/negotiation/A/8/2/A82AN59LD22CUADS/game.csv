"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $13,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $13,000. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I really think that's a fair price considering the initial offer was $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $12,500? That's a significant compromise on my end. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer, so I'll counter with $12,250. Can you consider that?",12250.0,Bob,6,
