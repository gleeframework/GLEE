Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum ($12,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum value leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Offering it for $14,000 represents a good balance. It's a significant profit margin for you while still being enticing to Bob.  

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. By having John as a backup buyer at $12,000, you're securing your minimum acceptable price."
