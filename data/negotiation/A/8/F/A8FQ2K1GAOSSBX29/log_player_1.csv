Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a higher price, but $1,625,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

We're getting closer, but I'm still willing to negotiate further to try and bridge the gap.  We're not that far off from a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,450,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable price, his ""final offer"" indicates he is unlikely to go much higher. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
