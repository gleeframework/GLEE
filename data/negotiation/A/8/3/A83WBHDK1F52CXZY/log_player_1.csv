I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering Bob at $10,500. This is a slight concession from my initial offer, showing some willingness to negotiate but still keeps me above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees me the best possible price, so I'll take that option."
