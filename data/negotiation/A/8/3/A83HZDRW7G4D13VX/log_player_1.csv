"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price well above both valuations.
* **Justification:** I frame the high price with a confident statement about the product's worth, aiming to anchor Bob's perception of its value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My language suggests willingness to negotiate (""proposing,"" ""starting point"").

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  By starting high, I aim to secure the best possible price.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how eager he is to purchase and how much he values the product.
3. **Control the Negotiation:**  Setting the initial price gives me an advantage in steering the negotiation towards a favorable outcome."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His willingness to move significantly down from my initial ask suggests he's quite interested. I'll counter with a price closer to my target, aiming to secure a larger portion of the potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I'm confident this product is worth more. Would you consider $2,000,000? This reflects the true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down from my initial price but not by a large amount, demonstrating some flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Reframing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's high value to justify my counteroffer and potentially nudge Bob's perception upward. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer seeks a price point closer to my initial ask while acknowledging Bob's interest by moving closer to his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I think $1,900,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a strong price. Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Significant Profit:** This offer secures a $400,000 profit margin, which is a substantial gain. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating strong interest and a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties if we continue negotiating. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is likely not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
