"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the value, $850,000 falls short of what I consider acceptable.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This reflects my desire to find a compromise while recognizing the product's true worth.  What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. While I recognize the product's worth, I'm  firmly committed to a price closer to $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $937,500? This would allow us both to find some common ground and close this deal.",937500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground.  I'm willing to be flexible, but to be completely transparent, I need a price closer to the $1 million mark.  How about $980,000?  This is a significant investment on my part, but I believe in finding a deal that works for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. However, $980,000 is still a stretch for my budget. How about we settle on $950,000? This is a fair price that balances our needs and allows us to close this deal quickly.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're very close! I respect your position and want to find a solution. How about we split the difference and land at $965,000? That feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",965000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $965,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go up to $955,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",955000.0,Bob,8,
