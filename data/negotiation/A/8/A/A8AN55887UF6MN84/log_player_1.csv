"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Not Too High:** While starting high, it's crucial not to alienate Bob with an unrealistic number. $1,100,000 is significantly above his perceived value but leaves space for negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes that this is a starting point and encourages Bob to share his thoughts, setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting $850,000 would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. I'll use the next round to counter and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the value, $850,000 falls short of what I consider acceptable.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This reflects my desire to find a compromise while recognizing the product's true worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession (But Strategic):** I've reduced my price by $75,000, a substantial amount. This signals flexibility and a genuine desire to find an agreement.
* **Still Above Bob's Offer:** The new price remains significantly above Bob's offer, pushing him to move closer to my range.
* **Rationale Provided:** I've provided a brief explanation for the price, highlighting my recognition of the product's value. This helps justify the offer and avoids appearing arbitrary.
* **Open for Dialogue:** The message ends by inviting Bob's response, keeping the communication flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. While I recognize the product's worth, I'm  firmly committed to a price closer to $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $937,500? This would allow us both to find some common ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating more seriously and has increased his offer considerably. However, $937,500 is still a significant way off my minimum price, and I'm better off pushing for a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see Bob move closer to the $1 million mark to consider accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground.  I'm willing to be flexible, but to be completely transparent, I need a price closer to the $1 million mark.  How about $980,000?  This is a significant investment on my part, but I believe in finding a deal that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Move:** I start by acknowledging Bob's attempt at finding a compromise. This maintains a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm stating my need for a price closer to $1 million directly. This reinforces my position without shutting down the conversation.
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting that my willingness to come down to $980,000 is a significant concession on my end.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the goal of finding a deal that benefits both parties, reinforcing a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. However, $980,000 is still a stretch for my budget. How about we settle on $950,000? This is a fair price that balances our needs and allows us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close, but every bit counts. While $950,000 is tempting, I believe I can still encourage Bob to move a little closer to my target. I'm willing to take a slight risk to see if I can secure a better deal in the next few rounds.  The difference between accepting now and potentially getting closer to $975,000 is significant enough to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're very close! I respect your position and want to find a solution. How about we split the difference and land at $965,000? That feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", 
""product_price"": 965000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I begin by acknowledging Bob's sentiment about being close to a deal, fostering a sense of progress.
* **Compromise Emphasis:**  By suggesting a split of the difference, I'm demonstrating a commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer aims to be my final move. It's a strong price that still maintains a significant gain over Bob's last offer while recognizing that closing the deal is now a priority.  
* **Call to Action:** The message concludes with a positive spin, implying that accepting this offer will lead to a successful outcome for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $965,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go up to $955,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be realistic. While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's latest offer of $955,000 is relatively close to my previous counteroffer. It's clear he's not going to significantly budge, and I'm running the risk of him walking away completely if I continue to push. Accepting now secures a solid profit and avoids the possibility of missing out on both Bob and John."
