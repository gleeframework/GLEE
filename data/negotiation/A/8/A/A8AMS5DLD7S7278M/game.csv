"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, even considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value your initial interest.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.  Let me know what you decide.",10000.0,Bob,6,
