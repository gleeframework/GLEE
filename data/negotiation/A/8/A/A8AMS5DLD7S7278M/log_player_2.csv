# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, even considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is far above his budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

While $18,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
