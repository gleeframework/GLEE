"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $85?",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice! However, I'm still looking to save a bit more. How about we try $80? Can you meet me there?",80.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go down to $80, Bob. But I'm still open to negotiating. How about we try $87.50? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise.",87.5,Alice,5,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about $84? It's the highest I'm willing to go.",84.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go down to $84, Bob. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm going to have to draw a line here. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $80, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at $88, I think it's time to walk away.",88.0,Alice,9,
