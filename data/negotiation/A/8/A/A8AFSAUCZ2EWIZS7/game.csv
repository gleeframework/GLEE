"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $10,000. That's the highest I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
