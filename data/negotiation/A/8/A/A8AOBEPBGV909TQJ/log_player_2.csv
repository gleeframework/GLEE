"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a strong counter-offer significantly below my maximum budget leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me a sense of Alice's willingness to move on the price. I'm aiming to be somewhere between John's price and Alice's starting price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but that price is significantly below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice moved closer to my price, she's still significantly above John's offer. I'll push a bit further down to see if there's more room for negotiation. I'm willing to go slightly above John's price if it means getting the product from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,275,000 is closer, my budget is quite firm. I could potentially do $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still staying well below her current offer. This keeps me in the negotiation and allows Alice to feel like she's getting a better deal than my initial counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1,150,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I could consider a final offer of $1,225,000. This offer takes into account the value this product brings and represents my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and the price of $1,225,000 is relatively close to John's price of $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will move much more, and I risk losing the deal entirely. It makes sense to accept the slightly higher price from Alice to secure the product."
