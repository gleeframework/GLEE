Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While I value the product at $1,500,000, I know Bob values it at $1,200,000.  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000), which gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. While I want to find a mutually agreeable price, accepting such a low offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but that price is significantly below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?"", ""product_price"": 1275000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer represents a compromise by meeting directly in the middle of the previous two offers ($1,400,000 and $1,050,000). It signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm aware I have John's offer as a fallback, giving me leverage to push for a higher price with Bob. I'm not desperate to accept a low offer.
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** By proposing a price closer to Bob's initial offer, I'm hoping to encourage him to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,275,000 is closer, my budget is quite firm. I could potentially do $1,150,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. By consistently rejecting low offers, I am signaling that I understand the value of the product and am not willing to settle for a low price. I'll continue negotiating strategically, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1,150,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I could consider a final offer of $1,225,000. This offer takes into account the value this product brings and represents my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm communicating the seriousness of the situation and my limited flexibility.
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my price slightly, but it's still significantly above Bob's last offer, emphasizing the value I place on the product.
* **Walk-Away Preparedness:** I'm mentally prepared to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't accept this offer. John's standing offer gives me the security to do so. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message maintains a respectful tone but clearly conveys my position and the value I bring to the table."
