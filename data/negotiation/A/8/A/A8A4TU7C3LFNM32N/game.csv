"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While $900000 is certainly lower than my initial proposal, it's still significantly less than what the product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while ensuring I receive fair compensation for the product's value. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
