"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point while leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.  Let's see if we can close a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be open to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal.  Let's see if I can get him to budge a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to continue working with you on this. $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still at $10,000.  This is a great price for the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with $10,000. It's only a small difference from my last offer, but it's still a step closer to my ideal price.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both close to agreeing and will accept my counteroffer."
