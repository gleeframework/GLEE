"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11750.0,Alice,5,
