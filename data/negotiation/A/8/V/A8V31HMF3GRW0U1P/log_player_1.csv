"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  It's important to set a price that leaves room for compromise, but also signals I believe in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a decent price, I'm still holding out for something closer to my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap.  The product is worth more to me, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $16,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but still leaves room for a reasonable profit for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. If not, I'm ready to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to drop to my minimum price of $15,000.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've already gone down to my lowest offer.  I'm not going to continue this negotiation. I will sell to John for $15,000, which is a good price for me and ensures I don't lose out on a sale."
