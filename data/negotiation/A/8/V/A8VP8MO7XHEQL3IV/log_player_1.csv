Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. The product is valuable, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary concerns, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle at $875,000? This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good deal. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of negotiations failing and having to settle for John's offer of $800,000."
