Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $1,750,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price from John, we can afford to start high. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,750,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly while still remaining above our minimum.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as something desirable. This can make Bob more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, given the information we have, this strategy maximizes our potential profit."
