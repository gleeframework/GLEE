Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

 ""message"": ""Hello Alice! Thanks for offering this product. While it seems nice, $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $110, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $75?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I can do $85, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle of our last two offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that she's unlikely to go much lower than $85.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a few more dollars, it's not worth the risk of the price remaining above your $80 limit. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs."
