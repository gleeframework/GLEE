"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15000, which is my absolute max.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is your absolute max, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $17000. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",17000.0,Alice,5,
