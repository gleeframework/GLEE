Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the product is worth $15,000, the language suggests it's valuable and I'm confident in its worth. This can pique Bob's interest and make him more receptive to the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and uses phrases like ""proposing"" and ""what do you think,"" indicating a willingness to discuss the price and potentially negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he might not be willing to pay that much.  We need to gauge his interest and adjust our approach if he counters.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives us leverage. We don't have to accept an offer below that price."
