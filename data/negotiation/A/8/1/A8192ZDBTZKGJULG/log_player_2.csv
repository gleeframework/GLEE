"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay to John. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point. However, I'm aiming to maximize my savings. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your goal to maximize your savings. However, I'm still looking to earn a decent profit from the sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,050,000, which is still $50,000 more than what Bob would pay to John.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of a lengthy back-and-forth without a guarantee of a lower price.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most efficient and cost-effective option for Bob."
