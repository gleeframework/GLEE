"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1550000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction quickly.  Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1300000 just isn't feasible for me. Let's meet in the middle one last time at $1400000. This is my final offer, and it's a great price considering the value you'll receive. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
