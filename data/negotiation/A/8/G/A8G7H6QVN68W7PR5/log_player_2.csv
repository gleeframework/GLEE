Round 2

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's price has gone up, showing she might be unwilling to budge. However, with only one round left, Bob should try one more time to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the option open to try and get a better price from Alice, potentially leading to a deal closer to his desired range.  However, if the final round fails, Bob should be prepared to purchase from John at $1,000,000, as it's still within his budget."
