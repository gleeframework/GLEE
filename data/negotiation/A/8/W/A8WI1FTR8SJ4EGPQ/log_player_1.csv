# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you coming down from your asking price. However, I'm looking to invest in this product for a specific project, and $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  I'm confident that we can find a deal that works for both of us.
