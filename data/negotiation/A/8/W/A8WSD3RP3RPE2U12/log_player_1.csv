Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate a bit more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting my minimum price from Bob. While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether."
