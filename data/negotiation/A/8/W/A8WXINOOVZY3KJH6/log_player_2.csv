**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $150, so he is willing to pay up to that amount. Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's price of $150, but Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
