"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  I'm confident that this price is fair considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer.  This reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly less than John's offer. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $300,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation."
