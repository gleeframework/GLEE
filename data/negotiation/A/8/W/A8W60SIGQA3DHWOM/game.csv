"Alice, your initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  I'm confident that this price is fair considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to negotiate.  To move us closer, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer.  This reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
