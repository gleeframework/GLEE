"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $130. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm happy to consider Alice's offer. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll reject Alice's offer since she's asking for $130, which is more than I'm willing to pay ($120 is the most I'm willing to pay). I'll look for a better deal.
