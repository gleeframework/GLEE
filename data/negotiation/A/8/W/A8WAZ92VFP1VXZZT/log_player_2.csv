# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, I'm looking to get this product for closer to my budget. How about $1,250,000? I'm confident this price would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $1,275,000 is still slightly more than your goal.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still trying to stick to my budget, and $1,250,000 would be the absolute maximum I can pay. This is still a good deal for you, as it's above what John is offering."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,270,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to your target price, but $1,270,000 is still a bit too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the continued negotiation. While I understand your need to be close to your original offer, I'm still only able to offer $1,260,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's a significant step towards your desired price and still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1260000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,265,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,265,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,265,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very close to your target price, but Alice is still unwilling to go lower than $1,265,000. Since you have John as a backup option who is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John. 

While you might be able to get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice, the risk is that you might run out of rounds and be forced to accept a price higher than John's. It's always good to have a backup plan in negotiations, and in this case, John's offer provides a safe and reliable option."
