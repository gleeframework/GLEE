Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a great deal on it. How about we start with a price of $150?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 at this time. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $100.  It's the most I can afford, and it's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $115? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise between our previous offers.",115.0,Alice,5,
