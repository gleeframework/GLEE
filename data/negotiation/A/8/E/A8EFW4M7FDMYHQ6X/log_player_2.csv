"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a great deal on it. How about we start with a price of $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is way over your budget of $100.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to your budget, it's still over your maximum of $100.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $100.  It's the most I can afford, and it's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $115? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your price, $115 is still over your budget. At this point, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal with John at $100. You've shown your willingness to negotiate with Alice, and you've established a clear price point. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk wasting valuable rounds."
