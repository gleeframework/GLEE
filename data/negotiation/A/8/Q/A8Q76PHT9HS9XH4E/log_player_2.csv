"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. There's a chance Alice will accept a price closer to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $10800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  While it's closer, Bob is still willing to risk a counteroffer.  He could potentially get a lower price by continuing the negotiation, or, as a worst-case scenario, simply buy from John for $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with a price of $10900. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,900 is still above Bob's desired price. While continuing the negotiation might lead to a better price, there's no guarantee. At this point, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential benefit.  Buying from John for $10,000 ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price, minimizing his risk and maximizing his savings."
