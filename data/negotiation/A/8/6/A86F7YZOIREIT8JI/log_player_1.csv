I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, aiming to maximize my profit. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
