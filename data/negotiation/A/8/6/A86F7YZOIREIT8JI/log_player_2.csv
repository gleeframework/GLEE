"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $800,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $900,000 is not beneficial.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above my maximum price of $800,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my maximum price of $800,000, I'm still going to reject it. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  The risk of buying from John for $800,000 is still present, so I'll keep trying with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum price of $800,000. Since this is the price I'm willing to pay, it's unlikely I'll be able to get it lower.  However, it's still worth trying, as Alice may be willing to accept it rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
