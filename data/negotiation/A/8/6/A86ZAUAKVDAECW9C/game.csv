"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which reflects a fair balance between our positions. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
