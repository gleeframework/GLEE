Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value. Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value ($80) if he thinks it's a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high leaves you room to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob counters your initial offer."
