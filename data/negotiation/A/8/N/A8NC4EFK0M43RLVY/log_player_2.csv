"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us - it's well below its market value and significantly more than I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent offer from Alice, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price."
