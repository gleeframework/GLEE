"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,175,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To make this work, I can meet you at $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value makes it worthwhile at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,200,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
