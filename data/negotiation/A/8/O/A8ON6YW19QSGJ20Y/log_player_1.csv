"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product to your business operations is significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm getting close to considering other options, but I still want to work with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our acceptable range. We're still well above John's offer, so the risk of continuing to negotiate is outweighed by the potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's make this happen. I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant discount while still recognizing the true value of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Offering a price of $1,600,000 applies a bit more pressure while still leaving room for Bob to counter if he's determined to negotiate further. This approach balances risk and potential reward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,580,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is clearly getting close to his maximum. Accepting $1,580,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer ($380,000 more) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
