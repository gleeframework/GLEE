"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I know you're a discerning buyer and appreciate your time.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice offers the product at your maximum budget, there's no harm in seeing if you can get a better price. You have the security of John's offer at the same price, so you don't lose anything by rejecting and potentially negotiating with Alice."
