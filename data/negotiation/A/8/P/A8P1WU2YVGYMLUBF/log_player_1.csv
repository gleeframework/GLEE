"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value and potential. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly closer to his valuation than mine. There's room for negotiation, and I'm not in a rush to accept John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I see the value you place in this product, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We've established a clear negotiation range now. Meeting in the middle shows flexibility on my part but still aims for a strong profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making a deal.  Let's try to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more.  While $1,300,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can still push for a higher price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems like we're getting closer. How about we settle this at $1,425,000?  That's a substantial profit for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1425000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm coming down in smaller increments now to signal I'm nearing my bottom line. This offer is still a significant gain above my guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, Bob is clearly demonstrating his upper limit. Accepting this offer ensures a very strong profit of $350,000 and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with John's default offer."
