"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's wise to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value and potential. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I see the value you place in this product, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.  While buying from John for $1,000,000 is a good option, I want to see if I can get an even better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making a deal.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems like we're getting closer. How about we settle this at $1,425,000?  That's a substantial profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I still believe I can push for a better deal.  $1,425,000 is still above my ideal price point.  I'll make another counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
