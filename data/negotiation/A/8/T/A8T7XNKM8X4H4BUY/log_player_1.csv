{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that leaves a significant profit margin for me while still being attractive to Bob, given his perceived value of $1,500,000.
* This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, but it also establishes a strong starting point. 
* I've included a friendly message to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is still a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired range. I'm rejecting Bob's offer to make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,150,000. This shows flexibility while still ensuring a decent profit for me.
* I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing the benefit of the deal.
* I'm using a friendly tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,080,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,080,000 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's still significantly higher than selling to John for $800,000.  Bob seems serious about buying the product, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  It's important to balance maximizing profit with securing a sale."
