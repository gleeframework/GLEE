"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500? This is still a great value for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
