Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and leaves potential for him to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for improvement. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a positive outcome.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I still have the option of selling to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $905,000 is a respectable offer, it's still lower than my desired price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm also considering the fact that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet."

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $915,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.

If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm confident we can finalize this quickly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $908,000 is getting close to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This offer represents a compromise,  giving Bob a slight advantage. But with only two rounds left, it's a good move to show a genuine willingness to finalize the deal. I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
