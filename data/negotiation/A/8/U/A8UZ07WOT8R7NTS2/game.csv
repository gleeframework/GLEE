"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to be within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my own price range. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500. It's getting closer to what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",10750.0,Alice,5,
