Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will get, making the offer more appealing.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for counteroffers, allowing for a potential middle ground.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to be within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is showing interest and willing to negotiate.  
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** I can always sell to John for a much better price. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my own price range. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob and the desire to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Remaining Flexible:** I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000.
* **John's Offer Still in Play:** I'm confident that I can sell to John for a higher price if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate and is clearly interested in the product.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  I can always sell to John for a much better price.

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500. It's getting closer to what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not by much. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** I'm using language that suggests finding a fair solution for both parties.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $10,750 is above my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting close to the middle ground.
* **John's Offer Still Available:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I can always go with John's offer if this doesn't work out."
