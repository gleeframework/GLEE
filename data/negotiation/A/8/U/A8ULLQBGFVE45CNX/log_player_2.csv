Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to give up yet! I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $155.  It's better to secure the product from John at $150 and avoid further back and forth."
