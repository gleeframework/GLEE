Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value,"" you subtly remind Bob that the product is worth a significant amount, potentially more than even his valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrases ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price further, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find a price that is mutually agreeable while maximizing your profit."
