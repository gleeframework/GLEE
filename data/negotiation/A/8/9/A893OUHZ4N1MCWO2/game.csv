"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
