{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, leaving room for negotiation, but also attractive to Bob given his valuation.  

Remember, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $14,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I think that's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my asking price.  While I'd still prefer $13,000, $12,500 is a good compromise and significantly more than I'd get from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
