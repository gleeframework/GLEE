Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a little higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the deal's value to Bob and leaving the door open for a conversation.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm not immediately committing to John's offer, giving me room to negotiate with Bob before potentially moving on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While John's offer is good, it's worth exploring if I can secure a price closer to my desired value by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $9,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reiterating that this is still a good deal for Bob by emphasizing the price advantage.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting further discussion and leaving the door open for a possible agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, Alice. How about $8,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price and wasting valuable time.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer guarantees me my desired minimum profit of $10,000.  It's a reliable and quick solution. 

By accepting John's offer, I ensure a certain profit and avoid the potential for further price reductions in the negotiation with Bob."
