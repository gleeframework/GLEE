"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $20,000 is a significant amount, but I believe it's a fair starting point considering the product's minimum value to me is $15,000.  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm still aiming for a good profit, but I've lowered the price to show I'm willing to negotiate.  $17,000 is a compromise, leaving some room for further bargaining.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,000 is still too low.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm getting close to my minimum value.  $14,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$11,000 is still too low.  While we're getting closer, I'm not ready to accept a deal that's so far below my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round.  I'm starting to run out of time, so I might have to make a more significant compromise soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum value but still hoping for a better deal.  $13,000 is a compromise,  but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway.  With only a few rounds left, I need to start getting serious about closing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'm getting closer, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  To ensure I don't end up with a deal that's not profitable, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not the ideal profit, but it's a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose money."
