"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
