"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,500, Bob. I can do $10,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,850? That's a fair compromise.",9850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,850. I can do $10,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm open to continuing the conversation.",10000.0,Alice,7,
