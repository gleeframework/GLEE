"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a fair price considering its potential benefits. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can't afford $20000. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? This price still allows me to cover my costs and offers you a good deal on a valuable product. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $15000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12000, which is my maximum budget. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look at other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm not comfortable going as low as $12000, I'm willing to go a bit further. I'm offering you the product for $13500. This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable product within your budget and me to secure a fair price. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $13500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12750. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,6,
