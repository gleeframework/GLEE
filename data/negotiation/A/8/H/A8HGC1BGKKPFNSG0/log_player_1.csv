Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but my budget for this product is limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $150 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is limited.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $160 is a reasonable offer given the limited rounds left.  I'll accept it and move on."
