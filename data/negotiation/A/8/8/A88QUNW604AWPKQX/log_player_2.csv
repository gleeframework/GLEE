"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $800,000. This gives Alice a chance to either accept and make a deal, or reject and potentially counter with a price closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above my budget.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, I'll go with the guaranteed lower price from John.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better price than John's offer."
