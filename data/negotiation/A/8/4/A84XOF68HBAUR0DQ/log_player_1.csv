``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get at least $15,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I will reject it and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves room for potential compromise.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and make one more counteroffer to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is my final offer, as it's very close to my minimum and I'm confident I can get $15,000 from John if this deal falls through.  I believe this demonstrates a strong commitment to reaching an agreement while also ensuring I'm fairly compensated for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating further.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale without any further risk."
