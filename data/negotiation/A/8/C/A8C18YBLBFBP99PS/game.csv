"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $950,000. Let's chat about it!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I understand it's a significant investment, but this product's value is truly exceptional.  Let's compromise. How about $850,000? This reflects both the product's value and your potential for success with it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see where you're coming from, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we settle on $775,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price point, but $775,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both the value of the product and your budget.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $800,000? That's a strong offer, and it would allow us to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
