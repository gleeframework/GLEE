"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the unique opportunity, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be interested in purchasing if the price were closer to $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $95. This is my best price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",95.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm happy to pay $85 and that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,92.0
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $85. I can meet you in the middle at $90. This is my final compromise, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",90.0,Alice,5,,
