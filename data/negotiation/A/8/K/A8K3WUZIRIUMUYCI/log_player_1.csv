Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing you to profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you are still making a profit even if Bob accepts the first offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly to incentivize him further, but you have a good starting point that still favors you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for his initial offer. I'll try to meet him halfway and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is insistent on his $10,000 offer, which is still below my minimum. While I could continue to negotiate, the time spent could be better used elsewhere.  John is a guaranteed sale for $15,000, which is significantly better than the $10,000 I would get from Bob. It's time to move on and secure the better deal."
