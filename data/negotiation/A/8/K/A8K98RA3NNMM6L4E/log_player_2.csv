# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than what John is offering. You can save $150,000 by going with John. Your goal is to maximize your savings, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
