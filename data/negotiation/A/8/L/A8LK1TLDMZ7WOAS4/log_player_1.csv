Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $750,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can make this happen.
