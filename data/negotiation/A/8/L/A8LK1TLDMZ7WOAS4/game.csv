"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $750,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a deal that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness about the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a deal for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a deal for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
