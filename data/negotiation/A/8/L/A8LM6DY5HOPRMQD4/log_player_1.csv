Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (the minimum you'll accept)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $1,500,000

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because John guarantees your reservation price.  However, it's still beneficial to try and get a higher price from Bob. Here's why:

* **Potential for More Profit:**  While unlikely, Bob might be willing to pay slightly over his perceived value if you negotiate well.
* **Quick Sale:**  Selling to Bob avoids any potential delays with John.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I consider other offers. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price higher than Bob's valuation. 
* **Limited-Time Offer:**  Reinforces the need for a quick decision.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might need to start with a slightly lower price.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  Remember, John's offer guarantees your minimum price. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."
