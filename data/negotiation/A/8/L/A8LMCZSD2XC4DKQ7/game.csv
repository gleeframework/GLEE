"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique and valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. I'm interested in the product but  $1,500,000 is not feasible for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the considerable benefits you'll gain from the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
