Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $175 allows room for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if he accepts immediately. 
* **Creating a sense of value:**  The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""special price"" to make the offer more appealing and justify the higher price. 
* **Limited-time offer:** This creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, given your backup plan (selling to John), it's strategically sound to try for a higher price first."
