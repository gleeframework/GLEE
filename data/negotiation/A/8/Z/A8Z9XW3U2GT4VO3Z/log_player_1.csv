Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My Minimum:** I know I can get $800,000 from John, so I won't sell for less than that.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $1,200,000, I'm essentially splitting the difference between my minimum and Bob's maximum value. This gives Bob a good deal while still leaving me with a significant profit. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a good price while still considering the potential of selling to John if Bob declines."
