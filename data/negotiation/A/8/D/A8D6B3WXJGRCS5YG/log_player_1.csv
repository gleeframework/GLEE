Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start with a higher price than you're willing to accept, especially if you're unsure of the product's value to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $15,000 gives us some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the product's potential value.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The best strategy will depend on the specific product and your assessment of Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested, and I believe I can get a better price if I counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I can always fall back on selling to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $9,000 but lower than $15,000 to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about $12,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still gives you a great deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer that is halfway between my original offer and Bob's offer, creating a compromise point.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the discount from the original price and framing the offer as a good deal for Bob.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message keeps the door open for further negotiations if Bob still finds the price too high.

**Strategy:** This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground with Bob while still ensuring a profitable sale for myself. It's crucial to gauge Bob's reaction to this offer and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to save some money on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get him to budge much higher.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further with Bob could take time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures a quick and profitable sale, meeting my minimum requirement. 

**Conclusion:**  It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 sale with John than to risk further negotiations with Bob that might not yield a better outcome."
