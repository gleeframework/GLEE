"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and gauge his potential budget. It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't serious about the deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still a price I feel comfortable with, and it leaves room for a potential deal in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more. I'm going to counter again, but I'm getting a little nervous. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, and I need to be careful not to overplay my hand."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

This is my final push.  I'm offering $1,850,000. It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but still above my minimum.  If Bob rejects this, I'm going to sell to John.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm not comfortable with the risk of continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure the deal with John and guarantee a profit."
