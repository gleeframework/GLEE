Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $100 as possible, as that's the maximum profit Alice can make.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so offering it slightly below his valuation won't work. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $100, so there's no pressure to go below that.

Offering the product at $99 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob, while still maximizing Alice's potential profit."
