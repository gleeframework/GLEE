```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but it allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He should keep in mind that he has a fallback option with John, which gives him negotiating power."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1300000.  We're getting closer, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is the very limit of my budget, but I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product and the compromise I've already made.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still negotiate a lower price and he's very close to his target of $1,325,000.  It is a risk to buy from John because he only has one round left. If he rejects Alice's offer and makes a counteroffer, he will have to accept Alice's next offer if she makes it."
