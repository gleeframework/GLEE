,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for your product. This is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1200000. This price reflects the product's value to me, and it's the most I can realistically pay.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but it allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's make this deal work.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints.  Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1300000.  We're getting closer, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $1325000. This is the very limit of my budget, but I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product and the compromise I've already made.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we're both getting close to where we need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $1340000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal before time runs out.",1340000.0,Alice,9,
