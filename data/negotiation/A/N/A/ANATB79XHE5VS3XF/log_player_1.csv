I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $110. Since my minimum price is $100, I'm not thrilled about accepting his offer, but I'm also not eager to sell it to John for $100. I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better price in the next round.
