"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob but not excessively so.  This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counter with a price closer to my starting point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $105 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and a good compromise considering the back-and-forth negotiation. It's also likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly higher price, making this a good time to close the deal."
