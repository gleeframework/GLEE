"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $9,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? That's the best I can do at this point.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,125?  That's a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to compromise, but $10,125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand we're getting close.  However, I'm still a bit away from my minimum.  How about $11,500? That's a significant step for me, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's try to close this deal within our budget constraints.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I think we're getting too far away from the original price. Can you reconsider and meet me at a price that's closer to your original offer?",9800.0,Bob,8,
