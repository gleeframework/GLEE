"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a little high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, however, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, considering its potential benefits.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle on $1,000,000? This price reflects a serious offer while acknowledging the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be candid, $1,000,000 is cutting it close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
