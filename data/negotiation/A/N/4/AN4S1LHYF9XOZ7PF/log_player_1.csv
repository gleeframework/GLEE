Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a little high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to negotiate, accepting this would mean a significant loss. It's better to counter and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, however, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, considering its potential benefits."",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle on $1,000,000? This price reflects a serious offer while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again, but I need to start considering John's offer if Bob doesn't increase his offer significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be candid, $1,000,000 is cutting it close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
