"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a price of $950,000 would be more reasonable, considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the value this product offers is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000.",900000.0,Bob,4,
