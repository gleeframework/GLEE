I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That way we both come out ahead."", ""product_price"": 9500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counteroffer one more time and then consider selling to John if Bob isn't willing to budge."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob has shown he's not willing to budge much, and I'm running out of time. I'd rather secure a guaranteed $12,000 than risk another round of negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a lost deal."
