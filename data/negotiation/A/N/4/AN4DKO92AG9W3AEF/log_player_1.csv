I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value, but it allows for potential negotiation and still leaves room for Bob to gain value if he believes the product is worth more than $2,000,000.  If he rejects, I'll happily sell to John for $1,500,000, so there's no risk of losing money on this deal."
