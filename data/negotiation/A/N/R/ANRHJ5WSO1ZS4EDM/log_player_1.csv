Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My primary goal is to get the highest price possible.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above that. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It gives me a cushion to potentially come down in price while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in its worth, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so I'm not losing money by aiming higher with Bob."
