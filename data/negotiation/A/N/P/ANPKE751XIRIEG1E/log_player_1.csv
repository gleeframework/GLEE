Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $10,000 (your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $12,000
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  $10,000 - $12,000

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John, you're in a strong position. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product at $11,500. I believe this offer represents a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $11,500 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob subtly reminds him why he's interested. 
* **Clear Call to Action:**  ""Let me know your decision"" prompts a response.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Confident:** You have a strong position with John's offer.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't meet a price you find acceptable, you have a good alternative.
* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to adjust your strategy based on his response."
