Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  It's important to get a high starting point to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is too low.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, so I'll sell to him and avoid further haggling with Bob."
