**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $925,000 mark. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll dig in her heels even more.  Accepting at $925,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of the negotiations breaking down."
