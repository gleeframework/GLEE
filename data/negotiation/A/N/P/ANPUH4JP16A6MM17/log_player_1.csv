I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation. I'm hoping that he'll accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than $10,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm offering $10,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $8,000.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob has increased his offer to $9,500, which is closer to my minimum value of $10,000. I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
