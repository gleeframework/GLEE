"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming back to me. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum target. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
