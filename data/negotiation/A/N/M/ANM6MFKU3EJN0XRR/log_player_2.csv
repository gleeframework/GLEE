It's not worth it to pay Alice's asking price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice is still asking for more than my maximum budget.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm offering a slightly higher price than my last counteroffer, but still under Alice's latest offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and compromise while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now within my budget and very close to John's price.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially risking a higher price or losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
