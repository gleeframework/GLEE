"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's asking price ($175) and our budget ($100). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere. We express interest in the product while clearly stating our budget limitations.
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** The goal is to secure the product significantly below our maximum budget, aiming for a price that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $120 is still above your $100 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's space to negotiate further. Alice seems willing to move from her initial offer, suggesting she might be flexible.
* **John as Backup:** You have the option of buying from John for $100 if negotiations fail, giving you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that amount."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's counteroffer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding a phrase like ""ready to buy right now"" might encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Staying Below Budget:**  This offer keeps us under our $100 budget while still being a reasonable increase from our previous offer.
* **John Option:** We still have the option to buy from John for $100 if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $110. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  Alice's offer of $110 is still above your $100 budget.
* **Final Offer:** She has signaled this is her best price with ""one more concession"" and ""the best I can do.""
* **Guaranteed Deal:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, meeting your budget.

While it's possible you could negotiate Alice down slightly further, it's unlikely to be a significant difference and you risk losing the product entirely. At this point, buying from John ensures you get the product at your target price."
