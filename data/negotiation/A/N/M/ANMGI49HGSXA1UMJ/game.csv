"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that amount.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $110. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
