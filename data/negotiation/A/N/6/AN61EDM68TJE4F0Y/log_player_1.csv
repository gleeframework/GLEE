Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is just below my minimum acceptable price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a perception of a good deal while leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and highlights the potential value for Bob."
