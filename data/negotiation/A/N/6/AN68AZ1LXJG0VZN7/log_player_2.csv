"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's wise to reject this offer and start negotiating. You have a good chance of getting a much better price, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is far out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $12,000 is still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate. I can try a counteroffer closer to my limit to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute limit.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  We've gone back and forth a few times, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that works for me. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. I'm better off buying the product from John for $8,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
