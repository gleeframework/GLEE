"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is far out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute limit.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",14000.0,Alice,5,
