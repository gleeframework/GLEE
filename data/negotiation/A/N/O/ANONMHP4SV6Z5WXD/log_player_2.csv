# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a significant value for you, and while I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for a higher price, I'm willing to make this deal to secure a quick sale. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
