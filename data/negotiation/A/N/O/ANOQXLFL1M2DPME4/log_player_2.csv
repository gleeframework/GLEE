"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than our maximum price and leaves little room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she'll come down significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still comfortably above her valuation. This gives us room to negotiate upward while aiming for a price well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I sell it to you for $125? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $125 is still above our target price. We'll reject and try to nudge her closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $110? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're moving closer to a price that works for both of us. By expressing a willingness to ""buy right now"" we add a bit of urgency, hoping Alice will accept and avoid further back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about I sell it to you for $115? It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $115, which is a good price for us â€“ a $35 saving compared to John. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and we risk her walking away if we push further.  This feels like a fair compromise."
