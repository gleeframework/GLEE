"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
