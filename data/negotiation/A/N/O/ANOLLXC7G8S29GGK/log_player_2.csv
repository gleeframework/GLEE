"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My goal is to save as much as possible.  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer gives room for negotiation and probes her willingness to drop the price.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming for a price significantly below my maximum,  leaving open the possibility of increasing my offer later if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice moved significantly:** Her counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Still room to bargain:** While $1,200,000 is better, it's still far above my ideal price and what John offers.
* **Maintaining pressure:** Rejecting keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer shows I'm serious but willing to compromise.
* **Anchoring to John's price:**  By matching John's price, I'm signaling to Alice that this is my absolute limit and I have an alternative.
* **Putting the ball in her court:** By making it my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Her language (""lowest price I'm willing to accept"") signals she won't budge further.
* **Minimal potential savings:**  Even if I could negotiate Alice down a little more, the savings would be minimal compared to John's price. 
* **No guarantee of success:** Continuing with Alice risks her sticking to $1,100,000 or walking away entirely.

At this point, the certainty of buying from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the small chance of getting a slightly better deal from Alice."
