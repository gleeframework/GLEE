Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit to Bob, suggesting the price is a good deal for him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for his opinion and leaving the door open for further discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."
