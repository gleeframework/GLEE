"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Would you consider $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's my top offer.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $110, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit out of my range. Would you consider $115? That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $115, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $122. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,5,
