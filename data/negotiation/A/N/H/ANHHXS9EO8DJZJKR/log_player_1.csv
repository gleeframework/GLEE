This is the best possible outcome.  Here's why:

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob lowering his offer.  
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a fair offer can lead to positive future interactions with Bob."
