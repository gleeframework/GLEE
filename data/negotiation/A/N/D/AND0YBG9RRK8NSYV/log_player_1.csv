Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above my minimum but leaves room for potential bargaining.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 isn't my ideal price, it's close enough to my target and significantly higher than selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
