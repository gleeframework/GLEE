"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,300,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  While there's a risk Alice might walk away, there's also the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings.  By offering $1,100,000, he is significantly below Alice's asking price of $1,300,000 but still above her minimum value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,100,000, but lower than her previous offer.  It's likely Alice is willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price. It's also worth noting that while John's offer is higher, Bob has not ruled out buying from him as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a strong signal of Bob's willingness to buy the product, but it also leaves no further room for negotiation for Bob.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to choose between buying from John at a higher price or walking away from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has come down from her original price of $1,300,000, and the current offer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,100,000.  While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, there's no guarantee.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal, and saves Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John."
