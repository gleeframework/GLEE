Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I believe $1,000,000 would be a fair price given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 falls significantly short of its true value and potential. I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget, I am unable to meet your latest offer. I propose $1,100,000 as a compromise. Thank you for considering my proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,100,000. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit ($300,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
