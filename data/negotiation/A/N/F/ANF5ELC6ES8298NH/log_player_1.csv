Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum, I leave room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's valuation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, I can always negotiate down, knowing I have John as a backup.
* **Confidence:**  Presenting a confident first offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still ensuring a sale, either to Bob or John."
