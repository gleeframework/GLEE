"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product.  Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my highest offer for now.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique benefits this product offers and leaves room for us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I have another potential buyer who sees its true worth. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, but this is my absolute limit. ",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from our last offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
