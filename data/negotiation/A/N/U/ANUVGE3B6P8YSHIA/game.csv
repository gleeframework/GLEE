"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think the initial price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significant, and $800,000 falls quite short of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
