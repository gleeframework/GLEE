Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will either accept or make a counteroffer that we can negotiate from."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,000. This is still above my minimum price of $12,000, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price to Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him. It's guaranteed profit, and it's a good way to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
