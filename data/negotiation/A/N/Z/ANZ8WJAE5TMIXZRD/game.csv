"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm looking to sell it for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $20,000 is already a significant discount on the true value of this product.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000.  This is a very competitive offer, what do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm serious about wanting this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
