Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
