"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
