Alice's offer is still too high. While it is closer to my budget, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my $120 limit."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $120.  Even though it's close, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a price I can't afford.  It's better to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $120."
