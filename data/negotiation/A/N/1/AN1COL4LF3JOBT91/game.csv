"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to offer $850000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of $880000. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $880000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $860000. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still be within my budget.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get to a price that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of $870000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
