"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls short of the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its significance. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can you meet me halfway from your original offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and I need to see that reflected in the final agreement.  Would you consider $900,000? It's a fair offer that recognizes its worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",900000.0,Alice,5,
