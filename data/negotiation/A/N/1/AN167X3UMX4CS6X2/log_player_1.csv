"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the significant benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1000000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $850,000 is a substantial sum, it's still significantly below the product's value to me ($1,000,000) and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount this early in the process. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls short of the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its significance. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between my initial asking price ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above Bob's valuation:** The $925,000 price remains significantly higher than Bob's estimated value ($800,000). This leaves room for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on Bob.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:** By making a substantial counter-offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about closing a deal and not interested in endless back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can you meet me halfway from your original offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer.  However, his latest offer is still considerably lower than both my valuation and my previous counter-offer. I'll continue negotiating to aim for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and I need to see that reflected in the final agreement.  Would you consider $900,000? It's a fair offer that recognizes its worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm reducing my counter-offer by $25,000, showing Bob I'm willing to move to meet him. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, the new offer of $900,000 is still significantly above Bob's stated maximum and maintains a strong stance on the product's value. 
* **Encouraging a Decision:** By making a smaller concession, I'm putting the ball in Bob's court and encouraging him to make a more significant move if he's truly interested in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but I think that's the best I can do. Can you reconsider and meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not budged from his $875,000 offer, signaling that this is likely his ceiling. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. It's time to cut my losses.  Selling to John for the full $1,000,000 guarantees I receive the product's full value without further risk or delay."
