"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That would be a great deal for me.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $109.  That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair to both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $108? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",108.0,Bob,6,
