Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $10,000, you're anchoring Bob's perception of its value.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing that you have John as a backup buyer."
