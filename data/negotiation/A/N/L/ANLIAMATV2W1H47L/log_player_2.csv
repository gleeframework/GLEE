"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could theoretically try to haggle Alice down further, accepting the $14,000 offer is the most strategically sound decision. Here's why:

* **Savings:**  Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Alice's offer in hopes of a lower price is risky. Alice might not budge, forcing Bob to settle for the $15,000 option. 
* **Value:**  $14,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a reasonable price considering his maximum willingness to pay."
