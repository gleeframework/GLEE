Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  bringing the final price closer to his maximum.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  This offer ensures a significant profit above my minimum ($12,000). Even if Bob rejects it, I have a guaranteed sale to John."
