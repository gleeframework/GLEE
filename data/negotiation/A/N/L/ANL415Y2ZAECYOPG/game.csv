"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget.  How about $9,000?  That's a significant move on my part.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10,200. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
