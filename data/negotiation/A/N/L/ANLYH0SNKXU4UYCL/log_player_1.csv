While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is getting very small. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with even less.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
