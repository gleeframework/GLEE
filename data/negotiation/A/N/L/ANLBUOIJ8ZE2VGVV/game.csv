"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find an agreement with you, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's worth and your interest.  What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
