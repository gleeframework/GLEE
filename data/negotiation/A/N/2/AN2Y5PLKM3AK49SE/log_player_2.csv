"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and what you know John is offering. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, aiming to bring the negotiation closer to your budget. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down slightly, but $130 is still too high.  We'll continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves two things:

* **Directness:**  You're clearly stating your desired price, which is your maximum budget.
* **Reasonableness:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" you're suggesting a sense of compromise. 

Let's see if Alice accepts or if we need to adjust our approach in the next round."
