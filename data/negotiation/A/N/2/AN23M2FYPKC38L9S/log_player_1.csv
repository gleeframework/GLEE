Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This gives you a chance to benefit significantly while still recognizing the worth I've poured into it."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 allows for some negotiation downward if Bob pushes back.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and frame it as a win for Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John) as Leverage:**  While not explicitly stated, Alice knows she has a fallback option with John. This gives her confidence to aim high with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher. If Bob is more agreeable, this offer might be spot on.
* **Market Information:**  Does Alice have any reason to believe Bob might be willing to pay even more than $1,200,000?  Market research is key."
