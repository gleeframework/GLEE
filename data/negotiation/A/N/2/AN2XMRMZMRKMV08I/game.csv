"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $12000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $11000? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go that low, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10800? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9900?",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $10900? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",10900.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9950?",9950.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $10800? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",10800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your time and effort in negotiating with me. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $9500. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8000.",9500.0,Bob,10,
