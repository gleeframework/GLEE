"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, and $115 is closer to what I had in mind. To be fair, would you consider $105? That's a reasonable compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
