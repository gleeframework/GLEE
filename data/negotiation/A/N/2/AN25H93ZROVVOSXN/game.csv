"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $100.  This product is quite valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, and $115 is closer to what I had in mind. To be fair, would you consider $105? That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",105.0,Bob,4,
