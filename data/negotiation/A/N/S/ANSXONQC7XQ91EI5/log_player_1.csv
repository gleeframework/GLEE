Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is $6,000 more than the product is worth to Bob, giving him a potential gain. It also leaves me with $1,000 less than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves me with a profit. This strategy maximizes my chances of Bob accepting the offer, while still ensuring a good return for me."
