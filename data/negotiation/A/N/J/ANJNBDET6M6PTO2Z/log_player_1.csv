Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's worth attempting to sell to Bob for a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It signals the product's worth while potentially enticing Bob with a deal if he values it more than he's letting on.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my desired price."
