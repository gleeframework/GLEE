"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  However, the $750,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I've considered your proposal, Alice, but I must stay within my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is the highest amount I can reasonably afford while still making a good return on investment. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
