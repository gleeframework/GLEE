Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the lowest price you're willing to accept. You'll sell to John for $1,500,000, making this your reservation price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This is the maximum he should theoretically pay.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  This is the range between your reservation price and Bob's value where a deal can happen.  In this case, there's no overlap in the ZOPA because your minimum price is higher than Bob's maximum value.

**The Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the information given, you have two main options:

1. **Aim for a Deal Close to Your Reservation Price:** You could start with an offer slightly below your reservation price, hoping Bob might value the product more than he's letting on or is willing to stretch his budget. 

2. **Proceed with John:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your reservation price, you could forgo negotiations with Bob entirely.

**The Offer (Option 1 - Attempting a Deal with Bob)**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* This offer is a significant discount from your reservation price, but it's still a substantial amount above Bob's stated value. 
* The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If Bob is a tough negotiator, he might outright reject this offer, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important (e.g., for potential future business), you might consider a more aggressive discount.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, going straight to John might be the most practical option.

**Remember:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and your own priorities."
