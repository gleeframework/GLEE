"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still represents a fair deal considering its worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
