Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming high.  I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I can always fall back to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd rather sell to him than John, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm still aiming for a good price, but I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  $12,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, and I'm getting impatient.  While selling to John for $10,000 would be safer,  I'm hoping to get a bit more and avoid the risk of John backing out later. I'll take Bob's offer, but I'll keep an eye out for better opportunities in the future."
