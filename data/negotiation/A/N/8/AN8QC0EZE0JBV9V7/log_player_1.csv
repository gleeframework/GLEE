{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,400,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,500,000 but still leaves me with a profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes negotiation. I'm aiming for the highest possible price while also considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  By offering a slightly lower price than my minimum, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still far below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to my bottom line. This will hopefully encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range in his next counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000, which is still a significant discount and represents a great value for you.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise that still keeps me above my minimum price, but it also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget while also highlighting the value he would receive at my counter-price. I'm optimistic and positive to encourage a deal. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maintaining a profitable price while staying open to negotiation.  I'm aiming for a quick resolution while minimizing the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe I can secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to my bottom line and signal that I'm not desperate to sell. This will hopefully encourage Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This is a great price for both of us, and it ensures a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise that keeps me above my minimum but is also closer to Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of this price, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to close the gap and hopefully lead to a final agreement. By offering a slight concession, I'm showing flexibility while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. I'm ready to accept if Bob agrees, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if this deal falls through."
