"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I will be moving forward with another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to achieve Bob's goal."
