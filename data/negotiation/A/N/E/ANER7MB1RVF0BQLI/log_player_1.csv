""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I will be moving forward with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have a strong starting point. Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** While $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's still a potentially appealing discount for him if he believes the product can generate more than that for him in the long run. 
* **Time pressure:** Setting a deadline encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from dragging out negotiations or lowballing you.
* **Alternative buyer:**  Mentioning another interested party (without revealing John's high offer) adds credibility and subtly pressures Bob to act.

This approach aims to maximize your profit by potentially securing a deal significantly above Bob's initial valuation, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
