"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I think we can both benefit from this transaction.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering your value for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $9,750 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,500, which is $10,250. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
