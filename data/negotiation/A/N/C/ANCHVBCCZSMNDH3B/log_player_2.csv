Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $101, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $101.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking a worse outcome.  Buying from John for $100 guarantees the best price."
