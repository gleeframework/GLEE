"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 to start negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. It makes more sense to negotiate further rather than accept such a low price or sell to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,000,000 is considerably below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,750,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer. I'm getting closer to finding a price point that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his actual value for the product, it's still too far from my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further before accepting a price so far below my minimum or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we are making progress.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,250,000 is still too low.  How about $1,600,000? This price reflects the significant value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. To be honest, my absolute top end is $1,350,000.  If we can make a deal work around there, I'm ready to buy today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum price. While it's below my ideal outcome, it's still significantly more than accepting John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better result, so it's strategically sound to accept."
