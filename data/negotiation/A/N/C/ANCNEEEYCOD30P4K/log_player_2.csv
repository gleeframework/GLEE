"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150 from John, Bob can likely get a better deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, it's still above Bob's desired price point and still closer to Alice's value than Bob's. There's room for further negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the offer and trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we settle at $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we try $107? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is Getting Closer:**  Alice's offer of $107 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point. It's only $2 away from Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or getting frustrated, potentially leading to a worse outcome for Bob.
* **Time is Limited:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's important to start closing the deal, especially since Bob has the option to buy from John for $150.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting $107 is a good compromise that saves Bob money compared to John's price and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
