"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob without revealing my own minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired range,  $9,000 is still below my minimum of $8,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I want to avoid selling to John at this stage as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's a good deal for both of us and keeps the negotiations moving.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiations positive. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is ""a good deal for both of us,""  highlighting the potential benefits of agreeing. 
* **Moving Forward:** I'm encouraging Bob to move forward with the negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is above my minimum of $8,000.
* **Limited Time:**  We're already in round 4, and the time to close the deal is limited. 
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll have to settle for John's offer of $8,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, I can potentially negotiate for additional value or concessions in the future (e.g., faster delivery, additional services)  if I accept this offer."
