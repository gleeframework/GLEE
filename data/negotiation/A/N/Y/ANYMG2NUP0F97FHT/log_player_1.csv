Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product between $80 and $150 allows for profit. Aiming closer to $150 maximizes potential earnings.
* **Psychology:** A price of $120 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob wants to) but starts at a point where you gain a significant portion of the potential profit. 

This strategy balances your need to sell the product above your minimum price while trying to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible."
