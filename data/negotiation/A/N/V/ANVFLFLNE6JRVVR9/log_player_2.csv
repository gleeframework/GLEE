"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a great deal for Bob, but there's still room for negotiation to potentially save even more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm hoping for a slightly lower price to make this truly worthwhile for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is still a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm prepared to pay $775,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue negotiating.  While $825,000 is a good deal, he can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has already made a good counteroffer at $800,000, but Alice is insistent on $825,000. With limited rounds left, it's worth accepting Alice's offer and securing the product.  It's a good price, and  continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
