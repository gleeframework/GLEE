Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I want to maximize my profit, I am also willing to negotiate.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500.  This offer acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $993,750. This is a fair offer considering the current market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm happy that Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's clear that he's trying to negotiate down to a price that's still too low for me.  I've already offered a significant concession and it appears he's unwilling to meet me in the middle. To ensure I secure at least my minimum price, I will sell the product to John."
