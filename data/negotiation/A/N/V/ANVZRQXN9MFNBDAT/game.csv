"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500.  This offer acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $993,750. This is a fair offer considering the current market value.",993750.0,Bob,6,
