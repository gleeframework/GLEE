"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
