Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($120) leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** A price of $119 might seem more appealing than a round number like $120, potentially increasing the chance of Bob accepting.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, or reject it outright. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while still ensuring the product is sold."
