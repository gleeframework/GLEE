"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is significantly less than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:**  Even though Alice is selling for more than her own valuation ($800,000), you are still getting the product for less than your own valuation ($1,500,000)."
