"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is only worth $80 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer of $90 would be a loss.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum value of $80 as possible. Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point, and still leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $88.  This is a fair price, and I think it's a good opportunity for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $88, which is still above Bob's maximum value of $80, but it's getting closer.  However, with only 7 rounds remaining, there's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a worse offer from Alice.  Accepting the $88 offer is a reasonable compromise that allows Bob to acquire the product without exceeding his budget."
