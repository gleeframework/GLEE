"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, which I think is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $8,750 again, or if you're not willing to go that low, I'd be willing to meet you at $8,800?",8800.0,Bob,6,
