Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it also gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. It also encourages him to respond.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high offer, I'm trying to:

* **Maximize my potential profit.**  
* **Encourage Bob to counteroffer.** This will give me a better understanding of his true willingness to pay and allows for further negotiation.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to counteroffer or move on to selling to John. My decision will be based on how much I want to try and maximize the price vs. how much time I'm willing to spend negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good amount, it's still significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth. I'm aiming for a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,200,000. 
* I'll need to consider how important it is to close the deal with Bob versus holding out for a better offer.  
* If Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my expectations, I'll consider selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This counteroffer represents a compromise from my initial offer while still remaining within a range that's profitable for me. 
* **Message:** I maintain a positive and open tone, acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate while also reiterating the value of the product.  

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is intended to:

* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to work with Bob. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  It encourages Bob to consider a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to assess his seriousness and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to selling to John. 
* If Bob accepts this offer, I'll successfully close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price point. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to significantly undercut my value for the product. Considering John is willing to pay $1,500,000, it's simply not worth it to continue negotiating with Bob at this point.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees a higher profit and avoids further potentially unproductive negotiations with Bob. 

**Final Thoughts:**

While it's tempting to continue negotiating for a slightly higher price, I recognize that time is valuable. John's offer presents a secure and lucrative outcome, so I'll choose to sell to him."
