"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,750. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,900, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet at this price.",7900.0,Bob,6,
