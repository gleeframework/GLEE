"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, getting closer to Alice's perceived value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a decent amount above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and explains that while interested, the initial price is too high. Offering a specific counter-price demonstrates seriousness. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to establish a lower price range for further negotiation, ideally moving closer to a price that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference and settle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved down in price, we still have room to negotiate.  We're aiming to get as close to $80 as possible without risking Alice walking away. A counteroffer between $90 and $100 keeps the negotiation moving in the right direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  Could you do $95? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still aiming for a lower price and haven't reached our absolute limit. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message reiterates interest and proposes a specific price point for Alice to consider."
