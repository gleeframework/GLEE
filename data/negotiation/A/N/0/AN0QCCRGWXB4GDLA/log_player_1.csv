"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, I'm subtly anchoring the discussion around a high worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language ""proposing"" and ""starting point"" signals that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:** His reaction will reveal how eager he is to buy and provide insights into his perceived value of the product. 
2. **Maximize potential profit:** Even if Bob counters significantly lower, I'm still starting from a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is closer to his true valuation, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a loss. I'll use the next round to counter his offer and try to move closer to a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see value in the product, but $600,000 significantly undervalues its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and expressing understanding. However, I make it clear that his price is too low.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's worth to justify my higher price, using phrases like ""true worth"" and ""exceptional quality.""
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate while staying well above my minimum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor the negotiation higher:** By countering with $900,000, I'm aiming to shift the middle ground away from Bob's lower offer. 
2. **Test Bob's flexibility:** His response will indicate how much he's willing to budge from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, signaling his interest in the product. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal.  The risk of losing the deal to John is outweighed by the potential to gain an extra $50,000 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $850,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to foster a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  While not literally halving the difference, this offer moves substantially closer to Bob's price, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Finality:** The language ""fair price"" and emphasis on ""true value""  subtly signal that I'm nearing my bottom line. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage a Deal:**  The significant price drop might be enough to convince Bob to accept.
2. **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm still leaving myself room for a small concession if needed in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $775,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his latest offer is still $25,000 short.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the potential reward.  

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to reach my $800,000 minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation takes time, and I have a guaranteed offer in hand.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Focusing on Bob might cause me to miss other potential buyers willing to pay more.

Therefore, it's strategically sound to accept John's guaranteed $800,000 offer now."
