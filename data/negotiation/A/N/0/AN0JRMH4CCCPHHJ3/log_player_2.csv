"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your target of saving as much as possible.  You can potentially get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal. How about $9,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750

Alice's offer of $9,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $12,000 and also gives Alice a reasonable profit. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product while saving money."
