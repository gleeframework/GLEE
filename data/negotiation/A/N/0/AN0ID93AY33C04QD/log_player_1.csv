Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:**  $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that profit zone as possible. However, being too greedy could make Bob walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an asset worth significantly more."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  ""Exclusive opportunity,"" ""immense value"" â€“ builds perceived value.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting its worth to Bob subtly reinforces his potential gain.
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $150,000, a strong incentive to buy. It also gives you a significant gain of $350,000 over your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. However, don't go below $1,000,000, as you have a guaranteed sale with John."
