"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is still well below my maximum price. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $110. It's a fair price considering my budget, and hopefully, we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as high as $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $102.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",102.5,Alice,5,
