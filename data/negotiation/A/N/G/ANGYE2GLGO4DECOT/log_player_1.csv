Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I'd get $12,000 from John, offering it slightly lower to Bob might incentivize a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,500 is a strong offer â€“ it's a significant chunk above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still a ""deal"" compared to what I'd get elsewhere. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  A faster sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for a guaranteed sale with John."
