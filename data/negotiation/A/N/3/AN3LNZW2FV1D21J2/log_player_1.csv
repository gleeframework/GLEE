"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can secure a better deal."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to do $1,050,000.  That's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit lower than that. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price of $1,500,000. I have 6 rounds remaining to negotiate and can potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I can't go that low.  Let's compromise at $1,000,000.  It's a fair price that respects both of our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit lower than that. How about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob, I only have 4 rounds remaining, and I'm getting closer to my minimum. However, I'm also concerned that Bob might be unwilling to budge much further. 

Selling to John now guarantees me the $1,500,000 I need, which is my minimum target. It's a safe choice that ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
