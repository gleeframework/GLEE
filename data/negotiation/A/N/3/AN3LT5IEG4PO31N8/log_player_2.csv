"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $11,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair compromise, and it still provides a good value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy from John. Alice's offer of $10,250 is still more than Bob's maximum budget. It's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring the best possible deal within his budget."
