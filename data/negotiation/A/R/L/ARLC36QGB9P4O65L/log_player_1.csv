Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you, as Alice, can send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly lower than Bob's maximum allows for potential negotiation upwards if he counters. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John. Offering the product at $1,400,000 gives you a significant profit margin above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob, you might adjust the offer price."
