"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

This offer starts high, aiming for a significant profit, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also above John's offer, so I'm incentivized to keep negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for significantly less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This offer from Bob is just above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm getting closer to my initial goal. It's a reasonable price, and I'm happy to close the deal now."
