"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $85?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90. I'm sure you'll find a buyer at your original price, but this is the best I can do.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $98, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",98.0,Alice,5,
