It's better to reject the offer and counteroffer Alice. You can try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13250?  It's still a great deal for you and gets us closer to a fair price.

You're still closer to John's price than Alice's, so it makes sense to continue negotiating.  You might be able to get closer to your target price of $12,000."
