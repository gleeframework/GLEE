Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting high allows room for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if he accepts outright.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but not outrageously so. It leaves space for potential counter-offers while keeping your profit margin healthy.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer confidently, which can sometimes sway a buyer even if the price is higher than they initially intended to pay. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no prior information about Bob's negotiation style or how price-sensitive he might be. If you know he's a tough negotiator, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower.
* **Market Demand:** The prompt doesn't mention if there's high demand for the product. If the product is in high demand, a more aggressive pricing strategy might be appropriate."
