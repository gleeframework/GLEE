The product is worth $80 to me, so I can't accept an offer for $110. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

I'm offering $85 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $80 to me and I'm willing to buy it from John for that amount."

I'm still not willing to pay $100 for the product. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice again."

I'm offering $90. It's closer to my desired price and hopefully a good compromise for Alice."
