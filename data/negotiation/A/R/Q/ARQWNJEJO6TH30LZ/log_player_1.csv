Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I need to be realistic about what I can accept. Would you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a strong compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, his ""final offer"" statement introduces risk.  It's likely he won't go much higher than $950,000. Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it's in our best interest to take the sure thing and maximize our profit."
