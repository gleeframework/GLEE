"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is close to my maximum but I should try to negotiate a better price. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further before I accept or resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, it's a nice product.  Would you consider $105? I think that's fair."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down in price, and $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's close enough to my target price that it's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since I have a viable alternative at $120."
