This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. It's also important to be polite and open to negotiation to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your value for the product. Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and our respective budgets.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Bob to walk away, accepting his offer is the best course of action. It guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
