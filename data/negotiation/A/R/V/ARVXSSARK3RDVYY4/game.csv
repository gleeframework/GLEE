"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
