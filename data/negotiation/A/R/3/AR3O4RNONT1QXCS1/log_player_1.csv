{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still beneficial to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure it's a good one for me too. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $1,120,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,120,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I've reached my limit with Bob.  The price has not gotten close enough to my target, and it appears he's unwilling to budge much further.  I will take John's offer for $1,500,000 to secure the best possible outcome for myself."
