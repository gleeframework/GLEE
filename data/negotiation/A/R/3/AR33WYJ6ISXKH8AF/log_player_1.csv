"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is tempting, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $12,500 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $11,750 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit higher.  Let's split the difference and settle on $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer of $11,900 is very close to my minimum, I'm concerned that we might get stuck in a stalemate and run out of rounds. John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which meets my minimum, so it's a safer choice."
