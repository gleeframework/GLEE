"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is tempting, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  Let's find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $11,750 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit higher.  Let's split the difference and settle on $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
