,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $120 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll be happy with it.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you at $115. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125, but I'll throw in a special bonus package worth $10. This way, you'll get the product and the bonus at a total price of $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus package, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you at $120. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",120.0,Bob,8,
