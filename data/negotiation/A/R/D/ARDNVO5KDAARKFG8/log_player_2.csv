"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than her value for the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we can still negotiate further. Her offer is still significantly higher than her valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer and Alice's counter, keeping the negotiation moving while pushing for a better price."
