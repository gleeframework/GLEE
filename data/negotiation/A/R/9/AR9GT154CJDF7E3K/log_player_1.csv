Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable for you, for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($14,000) leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay a higher price.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

This strategy balances risk and potential reward by aiming for a high price while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
