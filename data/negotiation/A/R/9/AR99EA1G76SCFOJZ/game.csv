"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.
