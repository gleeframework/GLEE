"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's more than you value it at, and it's within my range.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you won't regret it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
