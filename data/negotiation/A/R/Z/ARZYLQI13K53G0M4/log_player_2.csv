"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can likely get it for less than $13,500."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Alice has come down to $12,500, which is a good deal for me, and still leaves me room for profit. It's better than buying from John for $15,000."
