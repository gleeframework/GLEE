"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
