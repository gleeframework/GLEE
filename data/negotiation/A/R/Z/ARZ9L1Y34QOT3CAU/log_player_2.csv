"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better deal than $15,000, Bob can still try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $13000 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to selling the product for $13500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is only $1,500 more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's a reasonable compromise and a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  It's unlikely Bob will get a better price in subsequent rounds, and there's a risk of the negotiation breaking down completely."
