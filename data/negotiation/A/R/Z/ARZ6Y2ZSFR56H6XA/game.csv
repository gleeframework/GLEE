,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference and aim for $10,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
