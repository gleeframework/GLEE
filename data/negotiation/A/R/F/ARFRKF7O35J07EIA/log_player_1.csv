Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy follows the principle of starting high. 

* **High Initial Offer:** By initially offering the product at $18,000, Alice anchors the negotiation at a price significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000).  
* **Room for Negotiation:** This high starting point provides Alice with room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. She can gradually reduce the price, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Backup Option:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer in John at $12,000. This gives her leverage in the negotiation, as she doesn't *need* to accept an offer below her minimum.

**Important Note:** It's crucial for Alice to gauge Bob's reactions and be prepared to adjust her approach during the negotiation."
