``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $17,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer positively, emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
