"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's find a middle ground here.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's finalize this agreement, as I believe we are very close.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm truly grateful for your flexibility, but $14,000 is still just a bit too high for me. I'm offering $13,500 as a final compromise. It's a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued negotiations, and we're getting closer to a deal.  $13,500 is a great offer, but I'm still holding out for $14,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal, and I promise you won't be disappointed.",14000.0,Alice,7,
