# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is way above my budget of $10,000.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $15,000 is a significant improvement, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. There's still room for compromise, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's finalize this agreement, as I believe we are very close. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down to my ideal price point. There's still potential to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm truly grateful for your flexibility, but $14,000 is still just a bit too high for me. I'm offering $13,500 as a final compromise. It's a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your continued negotiations, and we're getting closer to a deal.  $13,500 is a great offer, but I'm still holding out for $14,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal, and I promise you won't be disappointed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, I've reached my limit for negotiation.  I'm not willing to go any higher than $13,500.  To avoid further rounds of back-and-forth, I'll buy the product from John for $10,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation that might be unproductive."
