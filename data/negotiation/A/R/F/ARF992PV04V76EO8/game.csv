"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $7,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $6,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",6500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $6,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $6,200.  Would that work for you?",6200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $6,350? It's still a bit above your target, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",6350.0,Alice,5,
