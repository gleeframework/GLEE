"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly below its true worth. Consider this my best offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price and also lower than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
