# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit and what John offers. You're better off securing the product from John at a price that fits your budget."
