Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start with a significantly higher offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  A high starting price leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Justification:** The message vaguely implies the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details. 

By starting high, Alice maximizes her chances of either securing a much higher price from Bob or falling back on her guaranteed sale to John."
