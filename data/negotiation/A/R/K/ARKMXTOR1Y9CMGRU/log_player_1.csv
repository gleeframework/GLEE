Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts by giving Bob a price that is higher than your minimum value, but also leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects it, you can always fall back on John's offer.  The key here is to try and get as much as you can while still being potentially appealing to Bob."
