"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value the product provides.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this work. This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can we compromise on that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $10,800. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we try again at $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $11,200. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to make a deal that works for both of us.  This is a valuable product, and I believe it's worth the investment for you.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go above $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers again. Can we try again at $11,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $11,000.  It's getting close, but I'm still not quite there. Let's make this final offer: $11,300. This is a small compromise on my part, and it's the very best I can do.  If we can agree on this price, we both get a good deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",11300.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I think I'll explore other options and see if I can find a better value elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,
