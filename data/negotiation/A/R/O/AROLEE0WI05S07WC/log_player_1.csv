Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message is structured to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a conversation about the product's value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:**  The success of this offer depends on Bob's perceived value of the product. If he's convinced it's worth more than $12,000, he might accept.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if his price is acceptable. You have the leverage of another buyer."
