"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit out of your budget, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I like the direction we're heading, but I'm still a bit short on my target. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
