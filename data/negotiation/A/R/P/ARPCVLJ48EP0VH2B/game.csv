"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've acknowledged it holds for you. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there yet. I understand that you're looking to keep costs down, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a final compromise from my side.  I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for you, considering the potential it holds. Let me know if you're willing to move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
