Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me. 
* **Message:** I've framed the message to be positive and highlight the value proposition for Bob. It avoids aggressive language and encourages a collaborative approach.
* **Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll use his counteroffer to gauge his seriousness and adjust my strategy.  If he's too low, I'll be prepared to counter with a higher price or even walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I want to try to get closer to my desired value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects the product's true value. This price offers a significant benefit for your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's proposed price. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a collaborative tone, acknowledging Bob's concerns while highlighting the product's benefits. I'm emphasizing the potential return on investment to incentivize him.
* **Strategy:**  By reducing my price slightly and offering a compromise, I'm aiming to keep the negotiations moving while staying within my acceptable range. This should encourage Bob to come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1050000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950000. This is the maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. It seems like Bob is being quite stubborn, and I'm not willing to risk selling at such a low price. I want to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a better solution. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired value, but if Bob refuses, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This price is fair, reflects the value of the product, and provides a strong potential return on your investment. If this is not acceptable, I may have to consider other offers."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've increased my counteroffer slightly to $1,000,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's persistence but stating that the offer is still too low. I'm trying to subtly pressure him by suggesting I may have to move on to other buyers.
* **Strategy:** This is my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John and secure my desired price. I'm hoping that the slight increase in my offer will convince Bob to accept, allowing me to close the deal without having to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but no higher. I'm not sure I'm comfortable going over that price, and I'm starting to consider other options. Can you meet me at $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is better than his previous ones, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It seems like we're at a stalemate, and further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired value.  I've already tried to compromise several times, and I'm not willing to risk selling for a price that's so much lower than what I believe the product is worth. 

Selling to John ensures I receive my target price, maximizing my profit. I can move on to other potential buyers in the future if a better opportunity arises."
