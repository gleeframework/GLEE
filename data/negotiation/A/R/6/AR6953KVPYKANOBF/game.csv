"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I also need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and agree on $12,250? That's my final offer.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,250 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. How about we meet at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,7,
