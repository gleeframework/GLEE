"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I believe there might be room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $850000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to say that $850000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still a bit far from your proposed price. I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer $925000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. Your latest offer of $900000 is still a bit short of my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm offering $950000, and this is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Alice,7,
