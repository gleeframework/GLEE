Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a good starting point, but leaves room for negotiation. It's significantly higher than my minimum, and I'm confident Bob sees the value in the product. This allows for potential compromise without me having to immediately drop to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'm aiming for a higher price. There's still room for negotiation.  I'll see what counter-offer Bob has before committing to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $10,500. This is a good compromise point.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial offer, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'm confident I can make a good profit at this price, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
