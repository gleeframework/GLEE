"Hi Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to get a good deal as well.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. How about $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise that would give you a great product at a good price and still allow me to get a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to $1,400,000, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and avoids needing to go through further negotiation.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to budge a bit more. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,337,500. This would be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you say?",1337500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,337,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,312,500. This would give you a good profit and get us closer to a deal.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
