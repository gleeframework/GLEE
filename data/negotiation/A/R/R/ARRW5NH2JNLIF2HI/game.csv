"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a starting price of $16,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $11,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,5,
