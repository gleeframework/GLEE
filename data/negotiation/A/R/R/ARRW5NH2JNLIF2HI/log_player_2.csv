Alice's offer is way too high. It's more than double your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

$14,000 is still too high, even though it's closer to my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

While $11,500 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's better to stick to my budget and buy the product from John for $8,000."
