"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is a bit tight, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  I'm serious about wanting this product, and I think this is a fair compromise.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet at $90? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",90.0,Alice,5,
