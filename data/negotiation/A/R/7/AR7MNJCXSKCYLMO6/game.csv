"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it would be a significant asset to your operations.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This gives you a substantial savings and allows me to achieve a price above my minimum requirement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
