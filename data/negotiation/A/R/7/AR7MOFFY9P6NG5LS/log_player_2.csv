Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, and that's my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Alice's offer. While $125 is still a bit more than I wanted to pay, it's within my budget and better than paying John $150."
