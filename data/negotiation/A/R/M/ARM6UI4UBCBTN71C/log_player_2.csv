"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:** $950,000 is less than $1,000,000.
* **There is room for negotiation:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  This means there's a potential for a price closer to $800,000, saving you more money. 

By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above what the product is worth to her. This shows I'm serious about buying but also looking for a good deal.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This leaves room for negotiation. Alice could accept, or we could go back and forth until we reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Avoid John's Price:** I want to avoid paying the full $1,000,000 to John if possible."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $900,000 is less than $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Alice has already moved closer to my initial counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Acceptable price:** While I'd prefer a lower price, $900,000 is still a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget.

Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a price that's within my budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
