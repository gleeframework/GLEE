I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a good starting point as it's slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
