"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You can save $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer, which is a good deal.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in a counter-offer, and buying from John is more expensive."
