"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  $900,000 is a significant investment, but the product's true value sits at a higher point. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this reflects the value you'll gain while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $950,000 falls short of the product's true value and the return I need for this deal. I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000, but this is my final offer.  Frankly, I have another buyer ready to close at $1,000,000, but I value our discussions and believe this product can be more beneficial to you.  Let me know your decision soon.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",980000.0,Bob,6,
