{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly tone and highlights the value of the product to Bob. It offers a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his price range and can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than $8,000 from John, I believe I can do better with Bob. He's clearly interested and willing to pay a premium. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $8,500 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close and represents a significant increase from John's offer.  It's in my best interest to accept and close the deal."
