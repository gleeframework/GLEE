"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $8,500 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
