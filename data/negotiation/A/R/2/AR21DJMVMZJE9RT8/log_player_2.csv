Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, so to move this forward I'll counter with $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise.
