"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, so to move this forward I'll counter with $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. I want to be straightforward â€“ my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000. I'm willing to accept this price as a final offer, reflecting its true value and my desire to close this deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
