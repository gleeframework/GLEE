"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
