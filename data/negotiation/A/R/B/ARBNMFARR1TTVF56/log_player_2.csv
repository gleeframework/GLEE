"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you would be willing to pay. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
