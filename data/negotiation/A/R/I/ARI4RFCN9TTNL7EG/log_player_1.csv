Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $12,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you can work down towards a price that's still very beneficial for you.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
