Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives Bob a reasonable starting point for negotiation, while also leaving room for me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell it for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. It's also just above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$9,000 is a good deal, considering Bob's previous offer. It's close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer in future rounds."
