"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to create a sense of urgency. 

**Strategy:** 
I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm leaving room for him to counteroffer, but I'm not going too low yet. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows he's interested. I can use this to negotiate a better price in the following rounds.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm not in a rush to sell. I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so I can afford to be patient.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $12,000, but lower than my initial offer of $14,000. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 simply isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Urgency (subtle):** By stating ""What do you say?"" I'm subtly creating a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob, especially since he's already shown interest. If he rejects, I'll have to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob's willingness to meet halfway shows he's committed to the deal. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my target price.
* **John is still an option:**  I'm not desperate to sell and can always fall back on John's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price slightly higher than $12,500. I'm also going to emphasize the value of the product and reiterate my willingness to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we settle on $13,000? This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product. I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** I'm sticking with $13,000, a price that is still above Bob's last offer, but  demonstrates my willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I emphasize the unique value of the product to justify the price.
* **Enthusiasm:** I maintain a positive tone and express my desire to reach a deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to accept. It demonstrates my flexibility and reinforces the value of the product. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at $15,000. I have only five rounds left, and it's important to start considering my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $12,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only four rounds left, I need to be more strategic and  consider how much time and effort I want to invest in this negotiation. 
* **John's offer is increasingly attractive:** As the negotiation stalls, John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 becomes more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly above Bob's offer. However, if he rejects, I'll seriously consider accepting John's offer.  I'm not willing to lose too much more money and I need to be realistic about my chances of closing a deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we compromise at $13,000? This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** I'm sticking with $13,000 for now. It's a compromise that shows flexibility, but I'm not willing to go lower yet.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential benefits he'll receive. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the importance of ""closing this deal"" to create a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this final counteroffer will convince Bob to accept.  With only three rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure. If Bob rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $12,750 one more time, but if I don't get a better offer, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. Can you meet me at $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds left, I'm facing a real risk of not closing a deal with Bob, and even if I counteroffer again, there's no guarantee he'll accept.
* **John is a safe option:**  John's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's final offer, and it's a guaranteed sale with no further negotiations required.
* **Avoiding potential loss:**  There's a high probability that Bob will either reject my counteroffer or make a counteroffer even lower than his last one, potentially forcing me to accept a price that's much lower than my minimum.

**Strategy:**

To ensure I don't lose too much money, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm prioritizing a secure deal that aligns with my minimum expectations."
