"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be extremely valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better price than John's offer, you still have room to negotiate with Alice.  It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a little too low for me. Given the product's true potential and the value it will bring to your business, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is within my budget and only $50,000 more than my counteroffer. This is a good deal considering that John is selling the product for $1,200,000.  It's worth closing the deal with Alice at this price."
