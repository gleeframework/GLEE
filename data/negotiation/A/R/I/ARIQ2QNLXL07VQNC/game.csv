"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a little too low for me. Given the product's true potential and the value it will bring to your business, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
