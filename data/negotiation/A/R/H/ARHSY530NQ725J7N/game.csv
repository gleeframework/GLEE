"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $10,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
