Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $80, I believe there is room for us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140, which is still above my minimum acceptable value of $150.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, while still trying to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is above my minimum acceptable value of $150 and it's a reasonable compromise.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale to Bob or have to sell to John for a lower price."
