"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price, closer to Alice's value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This creates room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Aiming Below Alice's Value:** Our goal is to get the product for less than Alice values it. By aiming for $70, we're well below her $80 valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  While a low offer, it gives Alice space to counter and still potentially reach a price we find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her lowest acceptable price, but there's still room for negotiation.  We're aiming to get the price as close to $70 as possible before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $75? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer, but only by a small amount.
* **Staying Firm:** We're still aiming below Alice's known value of $80, keeping the pressure on her to lower her price further.
* **Nearing the Alternative:**  We're getting closer to John's offer of $100. If Alice doesn't budge much more, we might have to consider buying from him to avoid overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $80 for this. It's my bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has explicitly stated that $80 is her bottom line. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Good Deal:** $80 is a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer ($95) and John's offer ($100). 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Price:**  Continuing to negotiate might irritate Alice or lead to a stalemate, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting now, we secure a good deal and avoid the risk of missing out on the product."
