Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price but still a potential profit. It's also close enough to Bob's perceived value ($100) that he might be tempted. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I haven't included this in the initial message, starting slightly higher leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
