"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to reach a fair price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal. $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $775,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been great to work with, and I see the value in the product.  How about we make this our final offer - $762,500.  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",762500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your offer is fair, $762,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $781,250.  This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",781250.0,Alice,7,
