"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a product worth $12,000 to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? ",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's get this done. I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  I'm not willing to go lower, so I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,750 is very close, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,100? I think that's a fair compromise.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to an agreement. How about $11,500?  I've come down a lot from my initial offer, and I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer, take it or leave it. $11,200, that's as high as I'm willing to go.",11200.0,Bob,8,
