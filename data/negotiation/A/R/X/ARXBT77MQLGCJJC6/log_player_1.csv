I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my goal with a counteroffer in the next round. There are only two rounds left, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price than I could potentially get from Bob."

With only one round left, I need to make a decision. Even though I'm aiming for a higher price, $898,000 is still a significant profit for me.  If I reject this offer, I risk ending up selling to John for a lower price.  It's time to accept Bob's offer and close this deal."
