"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice values the product at $100, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's original offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a fair price considering Alice values the product at $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high.  While it's closer to your desired price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so you have the leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, but still lower than Alice's latest offer. It shows Alice you're serious about buying the product, but are also determined to get a good deal. It's likely Alice will accept this offer, as it's closer to her desired price than your previous offer, and it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging from her price.  It's clear she's not willing to negotiate further. While $117 is slightly better than John's price, it's not a significant enough difference to justify continuing the negotiation.  It's more efficient to just buy the product from John and move on."
