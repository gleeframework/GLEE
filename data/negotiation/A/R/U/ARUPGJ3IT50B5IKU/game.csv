"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to come up a bit from my last offer.  How about $1,000,000?  This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can afford. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to finalize the purchase. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still think the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it brings.
