Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better deal. He can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation before he needs to consider buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still think the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it brings.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as John is offering the product at a price that aligns with Bob's budget."
