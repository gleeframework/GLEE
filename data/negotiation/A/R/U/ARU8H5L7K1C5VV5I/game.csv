"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair price that benefits us both.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  $10,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,500.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $10,750? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
