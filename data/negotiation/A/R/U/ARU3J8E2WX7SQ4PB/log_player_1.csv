Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This makes the final offer seem more appealing in comparison. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the deal. 
* **Ensuring a Significant Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down, selling at $1,300,000 guarantees a profit of $500,000, significantly more than John's offer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a balance between attractiveness to Bob and securing a deal."
