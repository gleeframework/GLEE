Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, increasing your profit. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, aiming for a price that gives both parties a significant gain fosters goodwill and increases the likelihood of a deal. 

This strategy aims for a win-win situation where Bob gets the product he values and you secure a price significantly higher than your alternative offer from John."
