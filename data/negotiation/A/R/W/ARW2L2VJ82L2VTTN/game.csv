"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $105?  That's a fair offer.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $105 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
