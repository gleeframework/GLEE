"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum price and much higher than what the product is worth to her. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's value of $80 without being unrealistically low. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but there's still room to get closer to your desired price point.  We'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $100? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again. This keeps the negotiation moving while signaling that you're serious about buying but still looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to go down to $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. At $105, the price is within your $150 budget and represents a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
