Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  However, that price remains above my budget.  I could go as high as $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as that is what John is willing to sell for.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed that John is also offering the product for $1,000,000. This means Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and secure the higher profit."
