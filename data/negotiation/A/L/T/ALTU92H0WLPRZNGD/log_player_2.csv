"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can still do better by making a counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to Bob's $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  I'm really interested, but my budget is a little tighter than that. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is trying to get as close to his $10,000 limit as possible. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message starts with a positive tone to maintain a good relationship with Alice.
* **Focus on Budget:**  Bob clearly states his budget constraint to show Alice he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,500. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:**  $10,800 is only $800 over Bob's ideal price of $10,000. It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price or a stalemate, ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at $10,000.
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiating further might take longer, and Bob hasn't provided any information about a time constraint.

At this point, accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice to get the product at a price that's close to his budget without risking a worse outcome."
