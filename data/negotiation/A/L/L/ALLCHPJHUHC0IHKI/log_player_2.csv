"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm thinking of starting at $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'll offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. It's still a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay and there's still time for further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob another opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit lower. I'd be happy to pay $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $9,000.  While $9,200 is closer to Bob's target than Alice's previous offers, it's still a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There are still a few rounds left, and rejecting this offer gives Bob another opportunity to counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, but I'm not budging any further than that. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,100 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price point. While there's still room for negotiation, there are only three rounds left. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying more.  It's also possible that Alice might decide to stop negotiating entirely, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer at $9,100 ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of a higher price or a failed deal."
