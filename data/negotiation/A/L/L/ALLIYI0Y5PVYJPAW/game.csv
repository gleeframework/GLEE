"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
