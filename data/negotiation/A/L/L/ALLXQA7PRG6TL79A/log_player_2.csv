"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm very interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still a little bit off.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,750 is closer to his budget, he's still overpaying compared to what John is offering.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to $8,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be at $8,750.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,250 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price, and I think we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
