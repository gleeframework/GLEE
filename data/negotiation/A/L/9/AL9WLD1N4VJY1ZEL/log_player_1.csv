Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $15,000, so $17,000 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still potentially go higher if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **It shows you're serious:** It demonstrates you're not just looking to get rid of the product at the minimum price.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you be able to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a little more. Since you know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he really wants the product. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to $16,000.  This product is truly unique, and I believe it's worth a bit more.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer and Bob's. It shows you're willing to negotiate, but still want to get a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's uniqueness subtly reminds Bob of its worth and could sway him to pay a bit more.
* **Positive Tone:**  The tone remains friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still cannot exceed $15,000 for this product. Could you consider meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $15,000.  While you could keep counter-offering, there's a high chance this will become a stalemate.  You've already reached your minimum price with John, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.  It's time to cut your losses and move on to a sure sale with John."
