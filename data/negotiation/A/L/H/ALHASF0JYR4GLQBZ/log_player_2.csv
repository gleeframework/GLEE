"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still too high. It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while giving me a solid deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above my target price. It's worth continuing to negotiate. We have 7 rounds left, so there's room to push for a better deal.  My goal is to get the price down as close to $750,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for the product.  This would be a great outcome for both of us, leaving us both satisfied with the deal. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  At $825,000, we're close to my initial counter-offer of $750,000 and well below my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal for me and likely a fair compromise for Alice. With five rounds remaining, there's a risk that we won't be able to reach a better deal. It's time to close the deal and secure the product."
