"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate. You can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to do $115?  I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to negotiate.  $115 is a bit too low for me, though. I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice has come down to $120, which is within your budget and a good deal for both parties. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential for a stalemate."
