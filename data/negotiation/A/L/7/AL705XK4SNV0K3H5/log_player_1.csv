Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
