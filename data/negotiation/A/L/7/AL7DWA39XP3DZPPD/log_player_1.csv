Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it valuable, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and still earn a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $140 is above Bob's perceived value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation while staying close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the product's value and positions the price as competitive, increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
