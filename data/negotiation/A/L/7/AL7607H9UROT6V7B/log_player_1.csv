Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While the product is only worth $120 to Bob, it's good to start with a price higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or for him to accept if he deems it worthwhile.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** Offering it at $140 is close to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. 
* **Encouraging a Response:** The message aims to be engaging and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
