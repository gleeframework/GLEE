Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and encourage a counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate downwards, knowing you have a fallback option."
