"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  While $9,000 isn't terrible, we know we have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price significantly closer to my target. It's a starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our ideal price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal, as we can't do better elsewhere."
