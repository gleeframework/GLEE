"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,262,500 is the maximum I can go. Can we discuss further?",1262500.0,Bob,4,
