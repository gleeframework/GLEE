Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140.  I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product for $140 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
