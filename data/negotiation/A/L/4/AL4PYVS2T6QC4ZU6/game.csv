"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit out of my price range. How about $87?  That's a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for both of us.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $92 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $89?  That's a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to meet you in the middle, Bob! I can do $91, but that's as close as I can get. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot.",91.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. I understand you have a price you need to meet, but $91 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",88.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to give up yet, Bob! I can do $90, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,9,
