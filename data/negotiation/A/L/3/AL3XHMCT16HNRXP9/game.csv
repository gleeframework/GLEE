"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and recognizes the value this product brings.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a good investment for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on making this work.  Let's try this - I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end and still reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",980000.0,Alice,5,
