"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to purchase it at a special introductory price of $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $10,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial solution. I am proposing to sell the product for $9,200. I hope this meets within your budget and allows me to maintain a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum willingness to pay of $8,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $9,200 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I've considered your proposal and I'd like to counter with a price of $9,000. I believe this strikes a good balance between your budget and my asking price, while also ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that he might end up spending more than he wants or that the negotiations will drag on for too long.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, it's the most financially advantageous option for Bob at this point."
