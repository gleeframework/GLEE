"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is considerably below its value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8,000. I understand this is a significant difference, but I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is quite large. I'm willing to make one more significant move to try to close this deal. How about $15,500? This is a very competitive price and reflects my strong desire to find an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still committed to getting this product, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
