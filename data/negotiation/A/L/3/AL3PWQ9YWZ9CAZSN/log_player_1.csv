"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation and tests Bob's interest without immediately resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counter his offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. This counteroffer might be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum and I'm getting closer to my desired profit. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and avoids risking further rounds of negotiation."
