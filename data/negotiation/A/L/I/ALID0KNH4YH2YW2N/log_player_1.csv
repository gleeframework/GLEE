{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Openness:** I'm expressing willingness to negotiate, which may make Bob more inclined to engage. 
* **John as a Backup:** The existence of John as a backup buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll gauge his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a deal, I'll happily sell to John to secure my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than I'd like. 
* **Negotiation Space:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet him halfway, or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm not desperate to sell at this point. John's offer gives me a strong safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $9,500. I might suggest $9,000 to show I'm willing to compromise but still want to earn a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise by dropping from my initial price of $9,500 to $9,000. This shows good faith and suggests a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize that this price is ""fair for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer. 
* **Good Deal:** I reiterate that the product is a good deal for him at this price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will wait for Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept his counteroffer (if it comes closer to my desired price) or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum desired value of $8,000.
* **Further Negotiation Unlikely:**  I've already lowered my price significantly, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a much better result. 
* **Time Factor:**  While John's offer of $10,000 is better, it's important to consider the time it would take to negotiate with him.  Selling to Bob now allows me to secure a decent profit without delaying the sale.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
