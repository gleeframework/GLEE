"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,350,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,275,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,250,000? I believe this might be a fair compromise between our positions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
