Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's excellent value at $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he negotiates, it shows he's interested but wants a better price. 
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Alice can always negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price."
