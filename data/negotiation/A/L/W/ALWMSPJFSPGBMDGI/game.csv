"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it.  This product is worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
