{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm offering it to you for $16,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, which will hopefully encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I think this product is great, $16,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm countering with a price that's still above Bob's offer, but closer to my initial offer. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to make my case."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $15,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $15,250, which is right in the middle of our two offers. If this is acceptable, I'm ready to purchase now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price. I'm going to accept it and sell the product to him for $15,250. This is a good deal for me, considering the value of the product to Bob."
