"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12000 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $9000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's closer to my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000, which is the price John is willing to pay. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
