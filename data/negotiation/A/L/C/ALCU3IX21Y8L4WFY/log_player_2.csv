"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There's no reason to accept it. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's budget. It's better than her previous offer, but Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000, which is the price John is willing to pay. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate further. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, as this is the best deal he can get within his budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice will only waste time and potentially lead to a worse outcome."
