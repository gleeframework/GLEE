"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $20,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $15,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I can meet you in the middle at $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $15,000. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down further or just buy from John for his target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $17,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Bob has already made a counteroffer of $16,000, and Alice is firm on $17,500. This means he's very close to his limit. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. John is offering the product for Bob's target price of $15,000, making it the best option."
