"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,400,000 is a significant amount for Bob, but it's still below his perceived value of $1,500,000.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still below my target. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $1,400,000, or even higher, with further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my preferred price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible, while still leaving room for a potential final price that's closer to my initial target. Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a good compromise. It's getting close to my desired price, and I'm not sure I can squeeze out much more. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
