"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal, while allowing me to make a profit. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a great price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
