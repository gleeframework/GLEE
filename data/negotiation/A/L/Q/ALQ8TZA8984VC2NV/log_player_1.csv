Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $130. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($120). 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the potential value he'd get. This increases the chances of him accepting.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects, I'm confident John will buy it for $150, so I'm not taking a significant risk by offering a lower price."
