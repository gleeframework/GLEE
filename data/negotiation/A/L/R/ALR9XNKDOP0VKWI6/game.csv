"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for my asking price. Let's start by discussing a fair price. My initial offer is $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $110 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price closer to your suggestion. I propose a price of $109 for the product. This is slightly above your offer but below mine, aiming for a mutual agreement. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $109 is still a little too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $108.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",108.0,Bob,6,
