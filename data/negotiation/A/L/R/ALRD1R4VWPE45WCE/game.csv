"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11500 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $11000 for the product.  This feels like a fair compromise, as it's closer to your offer than my previous one, and I'm confident it represents good value for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
