"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my initial asking price. To start the conversation, I'd be willing to offer it for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product brings. However, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fairer compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial counteroffer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $975,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a very fair price considering the significant value this product will bring to your business.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. Your final offer is tempting, but I have a firm budget in mind. I'm willing to make one last move at $990,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",990000.0,Bob,6,
