Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum price.
* **The Goal:** Maximize your profit by getting as close to $1,200,000 as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000, reflecting its significant potential for return."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value proposition.""
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a still-attractive $50,000 potential profit. This price gives you a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""potential for return"" subtly reminds Bob of the value he gains.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower, leaving more room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even in a one-time deal, a positive tone and respectful communication can go a long way.

**Remember:**  This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
