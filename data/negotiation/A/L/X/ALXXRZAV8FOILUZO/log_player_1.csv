"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice and I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value but significantly above my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer acknowledges that it's a ""starting point,"" signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  By mentioning the product's ""great value"" to Bob, I'm subtly reminding him of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to offer $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to counter to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This reflects my willingness to compromise while still recognizing the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm subtly reiterating the product's value to keep it top of mind during our negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's flexibility and determine our next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,375,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,337,500?  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged and negotiating in good faith, but his offer is still below my desired outcome. We're getting closer, and I believe I can secure a slightly better deal by countering again. I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. How about $1,350,000? This is a final offer from my side, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise and a win-win for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm adding a level of seriousness and urgency to the negotiation. 
* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This offer splits the difference between his last counteroffer and my previous one, showing I'm willing to compromise but also holding my ground. 
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:** I want to reassure Bob that this deal is beneficial for both of us, encouraging him to agree.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're past the halfway point in our negotiation rounds. While I'm confident in securing a good deal with Bob, I also need to be mindful of the potential deal with John."
