Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows for some negotiation room. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is my minimum value, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing some flexibility but still leaving room for further negotiation. I believe this price is reasonable, considering my minimum value and Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 below my initial asking price and a good deal considering my minimum value. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and it's not worth risking losing the sale altogether. Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my profit."
