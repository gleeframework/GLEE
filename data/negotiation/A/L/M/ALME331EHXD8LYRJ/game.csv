"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value to you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement quickly. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. I hope you'll consider it.",15250.0,Bob,6,
