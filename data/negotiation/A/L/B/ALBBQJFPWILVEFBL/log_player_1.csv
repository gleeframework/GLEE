Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product, which I know you'll find tremendous value in. Given its unique nature and your discerning eye, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This represents a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This means we have a strong starting point and room to negotiate upwards.
* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($2,250,000) allows room for potential negotiation downward while still aiming for a profit beyond the guaranteed sale price. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""exceptional"" and ""unique"" qualities to justify the high price. By highlighting Bob's ""discerning eye,"" we appeal to his desire for a valuable and exclusive item.
* **Alternative:**  While this offer might be rejected, the risk is calculated. We have John as a reliable backup buyer, ensuring we don't lose out on the minimum value.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit by leveraging Bob's interest and our fallback option."
