"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for a product worth $800,000 to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a middle ground is important to me too. However, $900,000 is a significant drop. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for a product worth $800,000 to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $1,010,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's value.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,010,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,010,000, which is $980,000. I believe this is a fair price for a product worth $800,000 to me.",980000.0,Bob,6,
