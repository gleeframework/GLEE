Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and emphasize the value to Bob, making the offer more appealing. 

This strategy aims to:

* Secure a higher price than my minimum.
* Encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to negotiate further. 
* If Bob rejects, I have the option to counter or sell to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still higher than my minimum price of $80 and is within a reasonable negotiation range. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or having to sell to John for $80."
