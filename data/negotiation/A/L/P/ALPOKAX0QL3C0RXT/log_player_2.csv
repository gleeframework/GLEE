"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is less than the $1,500,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and is a starting point for finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is still lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a good chance he won't get a significantly better price from Alice.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within his budget."
