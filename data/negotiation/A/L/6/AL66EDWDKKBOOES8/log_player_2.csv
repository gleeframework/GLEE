{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130.50, which is very close to your target price of $130.  Given you only have 3 rounds left and John's offer is at $150, it's best to accept this offer. There's a good chance Alice won't come down further, and you risk losing the deal and having to pay more to John."
