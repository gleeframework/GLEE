Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him ($12,000), but lower than what I can get from John ($15,000). This gives Bob a small incentive to buy, while still ensuring I make a profit. 

By offering a price slightly lower than my ""fallback"" price with John, I'm increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
