You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway but also emphasizes that I'm still looking for a better price. This keeps the negotiation moving and keeps the pressure on Alice to make a deal."
