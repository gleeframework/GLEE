"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to negotiate if you're interested.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value to you is $8,000, and it's a 50% profit for me.

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a price closer to $8,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $9,500. Let's try $11,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, but also shows that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target of $8,000."
