"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to get a good price while leaving room for negotiation.  This initial offer also sets a clear baseline and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I want to try and get closer to my ideal price of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that is closer to my initial offer, but still within the range that Bob may be willing to pay. I'm also framing the offer as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $13,250. I'm willing to go up to $12,800. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer.  There are still enough rounds left to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but $12,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm sticking close to my desired price but showing flexibility. I'm framing this as a ""final"" offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and we're reaching the midpoint of our negotiation rounds.  It's unlikely I can get a better price with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing too much money.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
