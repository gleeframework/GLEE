"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  It's significantly below the product's value, and I'm confident I can get closer to its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
