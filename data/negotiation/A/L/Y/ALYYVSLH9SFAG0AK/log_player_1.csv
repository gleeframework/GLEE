I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get more by continuing the negotiation."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I have several rounds left, and I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the best option."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $940,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $935,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
