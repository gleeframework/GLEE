"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he has incentive to negotiate. 
* **It shows confidence:** This initial offer demonstrates that you believe the product is valuable and you're not afraid to ask for a good price.

By starting with a strong offer, we set the tone for a potentially successful negotiation and maximize our chances of getting a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than our initial offer of $950,000 and we have more room to negotiate.  We are confident in the value of our product and want to maximize our profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We've lowered our price from $950,000 to $900,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain value:** We're still above Bob's offer of $850,000 and closer to our initial target. This keeps the pressure on Bob to come closer to our desired price.
* **Strategic positioning:** By meeting halfway, we signal that we're serious about selling the product while also leaving room for further negotiation.

This counteroffer allows us to maintain a strong position while showing flexibility, increasing the chances of a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we are still within the negotiation rounds and have a strong chance of getting a better price.  Rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate gives us a chance to see if we can push Bob further towards our goal.  If the negotiations fail, we can always sell to John for $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** We've lowered our price again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This offer is in the middle of our previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's current offer of $825,000.
* **Staying above minimum:** We're still above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring we don't lose out on profit.
* **Creating urgency:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, this offer may encourage Bob to accept or make a higher counteroffer. 

By making this offer, we create pressure on Bob to close the deal while still maintaining a respectable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is our minimum acceptable price. However, we've reached round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. Given the potential for further haggling and the risk that Bob might reject future counteroffers, it's strategically advantageous to secure the guaranteed sale to John. 

Selling to John now ensures we receive our minimum price and avoid the risk of further negotiation complications. It's a pragmatic decision that guarantees a positive outcome."
