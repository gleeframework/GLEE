"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects the value I believe the product holds. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell at a price that doesn't reflect the product's true value. I have more rounds and I can always choose to sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.  I hope we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. I believe that's a very fair offer, and it brings us close to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price point. I have several rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm not willing to settle for a deal that's significantly lower than my desired price, especially when I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,062,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $1,040,000. I believe that's a very competitive offer and would allow us to close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offer, while higher than before, is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a significantly better price.  It's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I reach my minimum goal and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower price."
