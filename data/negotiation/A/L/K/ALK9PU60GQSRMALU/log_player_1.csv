{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's slightly above the minimum I want to sell it for, but still leaves room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage. I'm hoping to get a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $140 is a little too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $155? I'm really hoping to finalize this deal, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it seems like he's serious about buying the product.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by continuing to negotiate."
