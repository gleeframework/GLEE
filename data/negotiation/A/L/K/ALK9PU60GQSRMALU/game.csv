"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $140 is a little too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $155? I'm really hoping to finalize this deal, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
