"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $850,000 is a step closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about $950,000? This would allow us both to achieve a positive outcome. Let's continue discussing.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
