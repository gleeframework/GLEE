"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. However, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100, leaving room for compromise.  I'm also emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $95 is closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will let me get the product I need. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a deal, $85 is still too far below my minimum price of $100.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be more firm in my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm firm on my price of $90.  This is still a great value for the product, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $90 is still a bit outside my budget.  I can offer $87, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's the best I can do, and it would allow me to get the product I need.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $100. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to my terms within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not yield a better result."
