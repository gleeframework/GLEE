"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is just not enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10500 to make this work. This is a good deal for you, as the product is worth $12000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
