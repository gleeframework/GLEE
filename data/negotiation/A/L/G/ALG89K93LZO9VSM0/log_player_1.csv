Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, even though I could sell to John for that price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just not enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this work. This is a good deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
