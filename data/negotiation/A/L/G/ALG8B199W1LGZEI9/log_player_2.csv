"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $140, while John wants $150.
* **You can still save money:** Even at $140, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $150."
