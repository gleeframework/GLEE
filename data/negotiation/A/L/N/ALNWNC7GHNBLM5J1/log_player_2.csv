"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better deal than John's $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that's acceptable."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum budget of $10,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer that demonstrates his seriousness while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still $1,500 over his target.  Bob is willing to risk negotiating further and potentially getting a better deal.  There's still room for Alice to compromise to meet Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm at $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk here. He's raised his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  He's still significantly below Alice's desired price, and this counteroffer leaves room for both parties to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This approach balances his need to save money with the urgency of potentially reaching a deal before his 10 rounds expire."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500. I can do $11,000 for the product, which is still a good compromise considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making concessions, $11,000 is still outside Bob's budget.  There are still 5 rounds left, which gives Bob time to negotiate a lower price.  By continuing to negotiate, he has the potential to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. However, $11,000 is still a little outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer while staying within his budget.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement while giving Alice room to make a final concession if she wants to secure the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,750. I can do $10,900 for the product, which is still a good compromise considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on saving as much money as possible. While Alice is offering a price closer to Bob's target, it's still $900 higher.  With 3 rounds remaining, Bob has time to negotiate further. It's worth taking the risk to see if Alice will make a final concession to secure the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $10,900 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $10,800.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. I hope you'll accept this final offer and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making his final push to get a price closer to his budget. This offer is just $100 above John's price, and with only two rounds left, it's a strong signal of his intent to secure the deal while minimizing his cost.  He's also emphasized the fairness of the price and expressed his desire to reach a final agreement, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,800. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $10,950 for the product, which is still a good price considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer of $10,950 is still $950 above Bob's target price of $10,000. With only one round left, the potential savings of a few hundred dollars isn't worth the risk.  Bob has a guaranteed price of $10,000 from John, which is the best deal he can get within his budget and the remaining time.  It's more beneficial to secure the product at a known price rather than risking another rejection and potentially losing out on the product entirely."
