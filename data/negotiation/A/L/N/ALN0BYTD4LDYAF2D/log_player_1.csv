Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on value:** I subtly hint at the product's value to Bob without revealing his perceived worth.

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me more leverage for a higher final price.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  If Bob rejects, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  A lower starting price makes it easier for Bob to accept or counter-offer, keeping the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  $120 is more than my $100 minimum, but it's below my ideal price. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to negotiate.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work.  How about $125?  It's a fair compromise and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing the counter-offer as a fair compromise to encourage acceptance.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and focused on reaching a deal. 

This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the need to reach an agreement quickly, maximizing my chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay under $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $115 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob has shown he's willing to go no higher, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and increase the chance of losing both Bob and John as buyers.

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale that's still significantly above my minimum and ensures I don't lose money on the deal."
