Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I need to stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price still leaves you with a good profit, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still working within a tight budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a bit more. I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's below my minimum threshold.  I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $11,250 for your product. This is my final offer. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, it's close enough to my minimum threshold and avoids the risk of a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a complete breakdown of the deal. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000."
