"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering its potential value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
