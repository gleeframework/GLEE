"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product for a limited time. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, a $2,000 discount from its true value to you. This is a unique chance to get a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is overpriced. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a better deal."
