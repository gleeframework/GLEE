"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's something that's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Your Value:** You value the product at $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** She's selling it for $100.
* **John's Price:** John will sell it to you for $120.

Since Alice's offer is lower than what you'd pay John, it's in your best interest to accept. You save $20 compared to buying from John."
