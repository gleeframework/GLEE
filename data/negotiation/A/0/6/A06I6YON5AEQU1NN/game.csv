"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense. What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While that initial price is a reflection of the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $980,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",980000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still quite a gap for me.  To be honest, anything above $700,000 is going to be a very tough sell. I could make a move on that if you're willing to meet me somewhere closer to there?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you, as I'm ready to move forward with John if we can't reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
