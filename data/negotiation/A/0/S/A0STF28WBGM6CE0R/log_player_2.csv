Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While I understand your position,  $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true market value and the potential return on investment it offers.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $2,000,000.  I believe this strikes a fairer balance while acknowledging the product's unique capabilities.
