"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to me. I'm confident this offer reflects a reasonable compromise for both of us. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While I understand your position,  $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true market value and the potential return on investment it offers.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $2,000,000.  I believe this strikes a fairer balance while acknowledging the product's unique capabilities.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product,  $2,000,000 is still above my maximum price point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
