"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $6500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we try again? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7000. This is a good balance between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a balance, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to try to get even closer to my target. How about we try again? I'm willing to offer $6750 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",6750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to accept $6750 just yet. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6875. This is a fair price that takes into account both of our previous offers.",6875.0,Alice,5,
