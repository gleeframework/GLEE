"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to get us to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You can try to get the price down closer to your ideal value of $8,000.  There's no reason to jump at the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  Considering the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $9,000, but I'm not quite comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good deal for Bob. It's still within his budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John. There's not much more room for negotiation, so accepting the offer is the best choice at this point."
