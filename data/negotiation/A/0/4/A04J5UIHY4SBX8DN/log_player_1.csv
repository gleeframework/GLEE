"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  I've carefully considered its worth and am proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer of $1,150,000 anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and careful consideration of the price, making it appear less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and suggests a willingness to discuss further.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential gain and leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000). Accepting this offer would leave a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. 

While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, it's still early in the negotiation. There's a good chance a mutually agreeable price with Bob can be reached with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,075,000."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer moves considerably closer to Bob's initial offer but avoids a straight 50/50 split. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still anchoring the price closer to our desired outcome.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message gently reminds Bob of the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By using phrases like ""middle ground,"" we emphasize the collaborative nature of the negotiation, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 matches our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or engage in prolonged negotiation. 

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Meets Minimum:**  This offer secures our baseline profit goal.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer and risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Bird in Hand:** A confirmed sale with Bob at $1,000,000 is preferable to the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

Accepting this offer represents a solid outcome."
