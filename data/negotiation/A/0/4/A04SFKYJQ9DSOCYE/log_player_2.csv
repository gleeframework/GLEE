"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There's room for a counteroffer since Bob values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. It's still a good deal for you, as you'll make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
