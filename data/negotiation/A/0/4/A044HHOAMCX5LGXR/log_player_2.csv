"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
 
This is a great starting point for the negotiation. It is always best to start with rejecting the first offer, even if it seems reasonable. This allows you to explore if a better price is possible."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you place on it, and it's a bit more than your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to your desired price, you're still paying more than you'd like.  It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $13,000 is still a little high. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you place on it while allowing me to stay within my limits.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,500.  While you could continue negotiating, you're getting closer to your limit of $10,000. It's more efficient to buy from John and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
