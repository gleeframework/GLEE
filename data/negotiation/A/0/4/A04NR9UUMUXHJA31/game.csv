"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
