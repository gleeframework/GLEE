"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me is capped at $800,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer. How about $875,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $862,500 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on it.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $862,500 is still slightly below my acceptable range. I'm prepared to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $868,750. This compromise ensures both of us get a good deal.",868750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $860,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",860000.0,Bob,6,
