"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. I understand it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $600,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $650,000.
