Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering it's worth the same to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm starting at the maximum price I know Bob is willing to pay. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still being realistic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher price closer to my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $750,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $875,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer. There's always a risk of losing John's offer if I keep negotiating and Bob ultimately rejects my offer.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, and it's not a bad price."
