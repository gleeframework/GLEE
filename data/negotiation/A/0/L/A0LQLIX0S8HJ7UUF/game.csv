"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,000. I can offer it to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. However, $9,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,250, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's close this deal. ",9250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $9,000, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think it's time for you to meet me halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,350. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",9350.0,Alice,9,
