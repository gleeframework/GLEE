Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that my offer to Bob is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer. This ensures I prioritize the deal with higher profit potential.

By offering the product at $11,500, I aim to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
