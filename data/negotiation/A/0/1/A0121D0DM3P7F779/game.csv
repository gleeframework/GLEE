"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but how about $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $87.50? That's the best I can do.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $91? It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be fair, but $91 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $90? That's the best I can do.",90.0,Bob,6,
