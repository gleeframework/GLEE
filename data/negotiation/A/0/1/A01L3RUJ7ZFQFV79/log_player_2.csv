Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Its potential to deliver substantial returns is far greater. I'm willing to meet you halfway; let's consider $1,075,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be sure this is a worthwhile deal for both of us. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your price range.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up. It seems we're nearing a point of agreement. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price for this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we'd ideally like to be closer to $975,000,  $1,010,000 is a reasonable price and a significant savings compared to John's offer. Continuing to push could lead to a stalemate and force us to buy from John at a higher price."
