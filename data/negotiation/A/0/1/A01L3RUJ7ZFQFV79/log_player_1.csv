Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I'm aiming for a more competitive price point.  How about we consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

This offer is far too low. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Its potential to deliver substantial returns is far greater. I'm willing to meet you halfway; let's consider $1,075,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is inching closer, but we're still a significant amount away from our minimum. We'll reject and counter-offer, pushing for a higher price while the negotiation continues."

We're getting close, but we're still under our minimum. Bob's latest offer shows he's willing to move, so we'll push a bit further before accepting or going with John."
