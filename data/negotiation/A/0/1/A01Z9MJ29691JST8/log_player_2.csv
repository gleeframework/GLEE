"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $60. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are looking for a better deal than $60, and you have time to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $60 is a bit high for me right now. How about $50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $55? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still looking for a better deal, and $55 is only slightly better than the $60 offer in the first round. There's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $55 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $52? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product."", ""product_price"": 52}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $53? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $53. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $53
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've gotten the price down to $53, which is a good deal considering your goal was to spend no more than $80. You have 5 rounds left, but continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away. It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product."
