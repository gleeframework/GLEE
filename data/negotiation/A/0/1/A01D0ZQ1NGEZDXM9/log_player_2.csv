"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you as the product is worth $10,000 to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can arrange the details. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John for $10,000.  By rejecting this offer, you open the door to getting the best possible price."
