Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping Bob is interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  I'll be ready to counter his offers if he rejects this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $17,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still holding onto a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $16,500 is a good compromise.  It's still above my minimum value and I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate."
