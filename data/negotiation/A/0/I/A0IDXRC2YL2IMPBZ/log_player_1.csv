We're getting closer, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. It's too early to settle for anything below $1,900,000 at this point."

While I'd prefer to get closer to $2 million, Bob is holding firm and we're getting into the later rounds. Accepting $1,850,000 now is a solid win and avoids the risk of him dropping his offer further, or the negotiations falling apart completely."
