Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a good profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below $150, but it's strategically advantageous to try with Bob first."
