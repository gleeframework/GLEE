Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling she's nearing her bottom line. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away. Accepting at $1,225,000 secures a good deal below my $1,500,000 maximum and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at full price."
