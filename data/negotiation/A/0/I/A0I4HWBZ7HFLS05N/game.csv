"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you thinking of me.  $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $130. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $120, which is my max, and what John is offering? I'd really love to buy it from you, and this would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
