Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to him, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be open to meeting in the middle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $11,750 is still below my desired price point. I'm going to counter again and see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
