"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $120 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get the product for less than $100. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial offer, you still have room to negotiate.  The product is worth $120 to you, and you have a fallback option with John, so you don't need to settle for $95 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $92?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
