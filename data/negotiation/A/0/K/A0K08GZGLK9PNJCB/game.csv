"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1200000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $1400000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $1250000. I'm still not willing to sell it at that price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $1350000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to pay that, I'll sell it to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your previous offer and my last counteroffer. I'll offer $1300000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you accept, I'll buy it from you. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1200000.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
