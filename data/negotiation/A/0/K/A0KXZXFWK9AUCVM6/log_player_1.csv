Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We're still pretty far apart. Bob is moving up, but it makes sense to hold out a little longer to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000."
