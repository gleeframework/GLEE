Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling to Bob that I'm willing to discuss the price, making him feel more comfortable making a counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** Using phrases like ""amazing product"" and ""I think you'd really love it"" aims to create a positive and engaging atmosphere for Bob.

By starting high and showing flexibility, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John would result in the same price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale without the risk of further negotiation."
