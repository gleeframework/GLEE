"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than $10,000, there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $8,500 is a bold move, but it's still within the acceptable range for Bob (less than $10,000) and potentially attractive to Alice, who values the product at $8,000. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,700 is closer to Bob's initial offer of $8,500, but it's still above Bob's desired price.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if they can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to compromise slightly but wants to stay below $9,500. Offering $9,000 represents a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer, and it's still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is close to Bob's last counteroffer of $9,000, and it's a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $10,000.  While it's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, there's no guarantee that he can get a better deal in future rounds, and there's the risk that Alice might walk away.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most sensible decision in this situation."
