# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, it's not worth the risk of negotiating further. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price without any potential for delays or a worse outcome."
