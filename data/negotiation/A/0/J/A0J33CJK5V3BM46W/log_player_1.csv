Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

Bob is still below my minimum acceptable price, but he's getting closer. I'll see if I can get him to move a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. That's a big compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000?  This gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While $825,000 is still below my minimum, I'm close to my floor, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I might not get a better offer from John. It's time to close the deal."
