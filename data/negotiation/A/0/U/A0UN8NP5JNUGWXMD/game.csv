"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500?  This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my desired value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
