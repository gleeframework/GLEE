"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,075,000 is lower than I can go. How about we settle at $1,110,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1110000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,110,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,090,000. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",1090000.0,Bob,4,
