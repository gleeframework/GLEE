Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider this price?

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it makes more sense at this point to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Further negotiation with Bob might yield a higher price, but it also carries the risk of him dropping out altogether."
