"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
