"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,000,000?  This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
