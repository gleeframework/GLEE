"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is worth $120 to you,  Alice's offer of $110 is still above your target price.
* **Potential for better deal:** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You might be able to get it closer to your $100 target.
* **John is a backup:**  You can always buy from John for $120 if you can't get a better deal with Alice."
