"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting significantly above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""value and potential"" to subtly justify the high price without explicitly revealing my bottom line.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.  Depending on his response, I can adjust my approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and my initial asking price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his message suggests he might be willing to go higher, it's too early to settle for $900,000. I'll counter-offer to guide the negotiation upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't accept anything less than $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but flexible:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but standing firm above my minimum price. The wording ""significantly below market value"" adds weight to my position.
* **Strategic concession:**  I'm coming down by $150,000, showing willingness to negotiate but also setting a strong anchor for further discussions. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's true interest and flexibility.  If he's unwilling to budge considerably, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my absolute minimum price ($1,200,000). While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my minimum target and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
