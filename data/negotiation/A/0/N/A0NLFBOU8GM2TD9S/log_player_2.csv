This product offers unparalleled value and functionality, truly deserving of its price tag of $150. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, I believe this investment would be highly beneficial for you. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product for $150, which is more than you're willing to pay. You can get the same product from John for $100, so it makes the most sense to go with that option."
