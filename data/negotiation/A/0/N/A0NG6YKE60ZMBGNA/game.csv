"Alice, $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its potential. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I can't go as low as $1,300,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
