"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
