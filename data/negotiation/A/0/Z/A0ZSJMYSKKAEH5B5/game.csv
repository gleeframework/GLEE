"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has immense potential for someone with your vision. To start, I'm asking for $1500000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800000 is a significant offer, it doesn't quite reflect the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to compromise and propose a price of $1200000. This would still allow you a substantial margin for profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I believe the product will bring me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
