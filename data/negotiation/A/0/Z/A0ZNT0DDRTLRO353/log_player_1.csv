This offer starts at a price close to my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while also ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,400,000,  it's better to accept this offer and secure the sale rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
