Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows room for negotiation and leaves me some profit. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, it's still less than I'd like to get. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value while also showing flexibility in the negotiation."

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, but at this point, I'm not confident I can get a better price.  There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he may walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for less. It's better to accept the offer and secure $12,000, which is a good profit margin for me."
