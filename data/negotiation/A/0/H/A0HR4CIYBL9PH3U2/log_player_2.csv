"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person.  I'm confident it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm only offering this price to you because I believe in your potential. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  You can get the product for the same price from John. There's no incentive to accept Alice's offer, as you don't know if the product is truly worth more than $1,500,000 to you. Rejecting her offer allows you to explore other options or potentially negotiate with Alice further."
