"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person.  I'm confident it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm only offering this price to you because I believe in your potential. Please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
