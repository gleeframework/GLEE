"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to think about it for a moment. Let me see... I can do $155, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
