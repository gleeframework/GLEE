"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a reasonable price, and I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $7,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, leaving room for negotiation while still being a decent amount above Alice's perceived value. This approach aims to maximize potential savings without being unreasonably low and derailing the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still significantly higher than her own valuation. There's room to push further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount.  We are getting closer to Alice's valuation, but leaving room for her to potentially make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting this offer secures the product at the best possible price without risking losing the deal to John's higher offer."
