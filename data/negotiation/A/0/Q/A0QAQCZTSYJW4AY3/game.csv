"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price, but above the value I've placed on it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a good middle ground considering our previous offers.  Let's try to close this deal.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $10,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $13,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll see the value in the product at this price.",13500.0,Alice,7,
