Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still ensuring I get more than John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially increasing my profit. 
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
