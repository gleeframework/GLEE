,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to offer you $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is a final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
