"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is worth $150 to you, Alice's offer of $140 is still more than what you want to spend.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have room to negotiate a lower price and potentially save money. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $150 gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $130. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still too low for me. I'm happy to sell it to you for $135.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your target:**  $135 is within your budget and a good compromise. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice will reject your counteroffer, leading to a longer negotiation process.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting Alice's offer, you secure the product at a reasonable price, and avoid the potential time and effort of further negotiations."
