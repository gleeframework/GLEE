"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits you'll reap from this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I must stick to my budget. Given your last offer, I think we can find common ground at $1,100,000. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
