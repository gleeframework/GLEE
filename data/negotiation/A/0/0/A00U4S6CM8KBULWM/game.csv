"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly significant. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this gap â€“ how about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your position.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm ready to close the deal, but $1,100,000 is still a touch high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
