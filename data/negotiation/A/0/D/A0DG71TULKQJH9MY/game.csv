"While I appreciate your offer, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $18000. This price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $17000, which is a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $17000. I'm willing to meet you at $18500, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,
