"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm looking to pay closer to what the product is worth to me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a good profit.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000?  This allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
