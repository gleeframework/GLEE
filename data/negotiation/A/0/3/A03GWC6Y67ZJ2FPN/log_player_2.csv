"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Alice values the product at. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm looking to pay closer to what the product is worth to me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000?  This allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and a $1,350,000 price is a good deal for Bob. 
* **Potential Loss:**  If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks Alice becoming less flexible or even walking away from the deal. 
* **Alternative Cost:** Buying from John would cost $1,500,000, making Alice's offer significantly more appealing.

While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting the offer at this point minimizes risk and secures a good price within his budget."
