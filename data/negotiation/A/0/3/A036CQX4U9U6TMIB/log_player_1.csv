Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  $175 is above Bob's $100 valuation, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Not too high:** It's below my minimum of $150, leaving room for me to accept a counteroffer if needed.
* **Positive framing:**  The message focuses on the value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

This approach aims to quickly get a negotiation going while still setting a high bar for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good opportunity to secure the minimum acceptable price of $150.  Here's why:

* **Meeting minimum:** Bob's offer fulfills my minimum price requirement of $150.
* **No guarantee of better:**  There's no guarantee that a counteroffer will get me more. 
* **Risk of rejection:** If I reject and make a counteroffer, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and I'll be left selling to John for the same price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, minimizing risk."
