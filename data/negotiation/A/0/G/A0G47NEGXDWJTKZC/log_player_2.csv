"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer. You can get the product for less than $12,000, and you know that Alice will be willing to sell it for less than $10,000. By rejecting the offer, you open up the possibility of negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals your seriousness about buying the product while remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still above your ideal price point. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
This offer is closer to Alice's perceived value of the product, but still offers some savings for you. It shows that you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that benefits you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, and you've already made a couple of counteroffers.  While you might be able to get it lower, the risk of continuing negotiation is that Alice might walk away or you might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
