"Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is unlikely to go lower than $90, and that's her ""final offer."" 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. 
* It makes more financial sense to save the extra $10 and buy from John."
