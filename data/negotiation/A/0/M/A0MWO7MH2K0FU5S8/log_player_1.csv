"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and slightly higher than what it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm starting with a friendly greeting to build rapport and hopefully encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Direct Offer:** I'm not beating around the bush. I'm directly stating my price, making it clear what I'm looking for.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to close the deal quickly, but I'm also willing to negotiate if necessary. 
*  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I have a backup option. 
*  I'll be watching for signs of Bob's willingness to negotiate, and I'll adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100 and leaves little room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

*  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point in the next round.  
* I'm keeping in mind that selling to John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as being ""fair"" to both of us. This subtly encourages Bob to compromise. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by suggesting we find a middle ground.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest in negotiating. 
* If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll consider lowering the price slightly in the next round, but I won't go lower than $85. 
* Selling to John is still an option if the negotiations continue to stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price too. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob, as he's shown a willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to $75 but still above my minimum. 
* **Watching the Clock:** I'm keeping in mind that I have limited rounds and will need to make a decision about selling to John if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle on $85? This is a good price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum price of $80. This shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial to both of us, which can make Bob feel more motivated to accept.
* **Focusing on Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of getting closer to a deal, suggesting that this might be a good time to accept. 

**Strategy:**

* **Test the Waters:** I'm trying to gauge how close Bob is to accepting. If he rejects this offer, I may need to consider lowering my price further or selling to John.
* **Time is Ticking:** I'm aware that I have limited rounds left, so I need to make a decision soon about whether to continue negotiating with Bob or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $78 if you're willing to close the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I want to try to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to $78 but still above my minimum. 
* **Weighing Options:** I'm considering the possibility of selling to John, but I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob before making a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $82. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 82} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final counteroffer, indicating a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Emphasizing Deadline:** I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob by mentioning the possibility of selling to someone else. 
* **Slightly Higher Than Bob's Offer:** $82 is slightly higher than Bob's offer of $78, but still a reasonable compromise given the limited rounds remaining. 

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** I'm hoping this offer is compelling enough for Bob to accept.
* **Decision Point:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round to avoid going too much lower than my minimum.
* **Time is Crucial:** With only three rounds left, I need to make a firm decision about my next move."
