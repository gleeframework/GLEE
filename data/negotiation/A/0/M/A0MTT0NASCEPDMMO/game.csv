"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and engaging in a productive negotiation.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down closer to $1,000,000?  I'm thinking $1,200,000 as a starting point for negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,750,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, I've found similar products in the $1,000,000 range. I'm willing to offer you $1,350,000 to keep our negotiation going, but if we can't get closer to that number, I may have to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this deal work for both of us.  However,  the quality and uniqueness of this product set it apart from others you may have seen.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the value it brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is simply more than I'm willing to pay. I've been carefully considering my options, and I'm prepared to offer you $1,400,000 to get this deal done.  However, I also need to be upfront: if we can't agree on this amount, I'm going to have to go with a different vendor who can meet my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
