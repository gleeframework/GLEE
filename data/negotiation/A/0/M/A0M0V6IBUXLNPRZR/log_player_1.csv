Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 makes it slightly more appealing than the guaranteed $100 from John. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
It's a balancing act. If the price is too high, Bob will reject it. If it's too low, I miss out on potential profit. This approach aims for the sweet spot."
