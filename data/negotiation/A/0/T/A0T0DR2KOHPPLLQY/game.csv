"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, my absolute limit is $900,000. If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Alice,5,
