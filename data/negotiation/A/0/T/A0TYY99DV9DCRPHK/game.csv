"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $700,000 is quite a bit below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $800,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
