"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm open to discussing the price further, so please let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, $10,000 is still quite low for what I'm offering.  How about we settle at $12,500? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",12500.0,Alice,5,
