"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product exclusively to you before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $95 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. Your goal is to save money, and buying from John is the most financially beneficial option."
