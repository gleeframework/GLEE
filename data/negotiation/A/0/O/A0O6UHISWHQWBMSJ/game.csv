"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This seems like a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still above your minimum. Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I think it's reasonable to aim for a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
