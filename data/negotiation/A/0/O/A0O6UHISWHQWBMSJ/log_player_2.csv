"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with her further.  While you can buy from John for $1,500,000, it's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This seems like a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still above your minimum. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I think it's reasonable to aim for a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is within your budget.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for you, saving you $450,000 compared to buying from John."
