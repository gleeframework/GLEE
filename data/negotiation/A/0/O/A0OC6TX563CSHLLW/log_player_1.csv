Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he haggles. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning your belief in the product's value, you create a sense of worth. 
* **""Special"" Offer:**  Framing the lower price as a special offer specifically for Bob encourages him to take the deal.
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup buyer who will pay your minimum acceptable price."
