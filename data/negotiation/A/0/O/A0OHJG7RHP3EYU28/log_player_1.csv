Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $160, I'm trying to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value higher than his estimated $80. Even if he doesn't accept the initial price, it might make a counteroffer closer to my desired range more likely. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I know I have John as a backup who will pay $120, so I'm not desperate to sell it to Bob for any price. I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation if it's not beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I could get from John. I have room to negotiate and will try to bring Bob closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by moving significantly down from my initial price. 
* **Targeting Midpoint:**  $130 is roughly halfway between his offer ($100) and my previous asking price ($160), aiming for a compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($120) and keeps the possibility of a profitable deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Minimal Gain:** While $110 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, it's still a better outcome than continuing to negotiate and risking losing both Bob and John as potential buyers. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures the sale and allows me to move on."
