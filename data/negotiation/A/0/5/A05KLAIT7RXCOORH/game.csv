"Hi Alice,  While I appreciate your offer, $16,000 is out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still too high. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $14,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $11,000. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $11,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  Could we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would be my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  My absolute maximum is $11,500.  I really want to buy this product, but I can't go higher.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,6,
