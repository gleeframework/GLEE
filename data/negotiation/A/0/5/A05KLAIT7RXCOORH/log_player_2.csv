Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $11,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  Could we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $13,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. If not, I'll go with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still staying within my budget and emphasizing my desire for the product. This shows I'm willing to compromise but have a firm limit."
