Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $140 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but still offers him a potential ""deal."" 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down a little. You can then decide if you want to accept a slightly lower price (e.g., $130) or stick to your minimum of $150."
