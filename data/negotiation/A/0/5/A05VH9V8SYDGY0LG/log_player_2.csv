Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, so I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,250 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'll meet you at $10,500, but I need you to commit to the deal this time. If you're still not comfortable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one!  Alice is clearly holding firm, and while we could try to push further, there's a real risk she'll walk away.  At $10,500, we're still getting a significant discount compared to John's $15,000 price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it entirely."
