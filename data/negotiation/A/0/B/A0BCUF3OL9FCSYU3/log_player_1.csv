"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate if necessary.  It's important to start high, but also realistic enough to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and find a price we both agree on."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering $12,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm aiming to meet him halfway and hopefully close the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for a price that low yet. I'm still hoping for a higher offer and will try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I believe this is a fair offer that shows my willingness to negotiate while still getting a decent price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,500. While it's getting closer, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I'm not ready to settle for this yet and will make a final counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and only $500 above my minimum. I believe this is a fair and final offer, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal while still getting a reasonable price."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $10,000.  While I would prefer to get more, Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher than $9,800.  With only two rounds left, it's not worth risking getting stuck with a lower price. John's offer guarantees me my minimum value, and I'm confident I can find a better deal in the future."
