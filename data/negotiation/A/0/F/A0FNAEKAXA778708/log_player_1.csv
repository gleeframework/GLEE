Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a price slightly below that with Bob allows us to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By setting the price at $1,150,000:
    * We create a sense of urgency for Bob (limited-time offer).
    * We position the price as a potential bargain compared to John's standing offer (unknown to Bob).
    * We leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a high likelihood of selling the product."
