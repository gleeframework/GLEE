"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  However, I'm leaving room for negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to sell for. Accepting it guarantees me the minimum profit.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price, and I risk losing the deal altogether."
