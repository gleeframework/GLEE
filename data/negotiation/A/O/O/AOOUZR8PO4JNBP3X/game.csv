"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the market value and the potential benefits.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial price is based on the true potential and extensive analysis of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too much for me.  I'm confident this product holds great value, but I can't justify going beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This shows my commitment to closing this deal, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
