""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiations at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and benefits it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the market value and the potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a no-brainer. Bob's offer is far too low, and we have plenty of room to negotiate. We'll reject this and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial price is based on the true potential and extensive analysis of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Big Gap:**  There's a massive difference between Bob's valuation ($800,000) and ours ($1,500,000 minimum). We need to bridge that gap strategically.
* **Strong Stance:** We started high to leave room for negotiation. Coming down by $300,000 shows flexibility but keeps us in a strong position.
* **Justification:**  We're emphasizing the product's ""true potential"" to remind Bob why our price is justified. 
* **Urgency:** We're getting closer to the middle ground, but we also need to keep in mind the option of John's offer as time progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too much for me.  I'm confident this product holds great value, but I can't justify going beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly anchored to his initial offer. We need to show him we're serious about negotiating but also that we won't settle for a low price. We'll reject and counter with a smaller concession in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  To show I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Smaller Concession:**  We're dropping by $200,000 this time, showing willingness to negotiate but also indicating that our price is firming up.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** We're reiterating the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget, hoping to find common ground.
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of John's offer becomes more appealing. We need to move Bob closer to a deal or consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This shows my commitment to closing this deal, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tricky decision point. Bob has finally moved off his anchored price, which is a good sign, but $1,000,000 is still less than what John is offering. However, we need to weigh the risk of Bob walking away. Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Move:** A $200,000 jump from Bob is significant. He's showing more willingness to negotiate.
* **Time Remaining:** We have 4 rounds left.  Continuing might lead to a better deal with Bob, but there's also a risk he won't budge much further.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John's offer is a sure thing, while there's no guarantee Bob will meet our desired price.

Given the factors, and leaning towards risk aversion, this is a good time to take John's guaranteed offer. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk is that he gets frustrated and walks, leaving us with a potentially lower offer in the later rounds. John's offer secures our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
