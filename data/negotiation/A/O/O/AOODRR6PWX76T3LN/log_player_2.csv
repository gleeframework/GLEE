"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $11,000, and it's within Bob's budget of $12,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a good price while saving $1,750 compared to buying from John. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but the potential gains are not significant enough to warrant the risk of potentially losing the deal with Alice."
