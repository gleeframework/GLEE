"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a significant improvement from my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's getting close to my desired price point, and I'm concerned that if I reject it, I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  I'm also running the risk of Bob walking away completely, leaving me with only the $800,000 offer from John."
