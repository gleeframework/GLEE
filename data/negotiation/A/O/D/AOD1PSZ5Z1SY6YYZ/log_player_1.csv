Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, you aim to get the highest price possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with an offer of $14,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you could potentially still settle above John's $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation style or risk tolerance. A more aggressive opening offer might be possible depending on those factors."
