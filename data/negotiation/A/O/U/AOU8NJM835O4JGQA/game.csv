"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I've already offered you a better deal than $105 in the previous round. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $107.50, and that's as low as I can go.",107.5,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I've already met you halfway between $105 and $107.50. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to stay above $107. I can do $107.75, and that's my final offer on that level of compromise.",107.75,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions.
