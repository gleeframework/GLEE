"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, but this gives him room to negotiate and hopefully, we can find a middle ground.  I'm also leaving myself room to reduce the price if necessary without going below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired range with further negotiation.  I'm also not desperate to sell to Bob and have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my target.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept my counteroffer, as I'm not too far from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and falls within my minimum acceptable range.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffers and ultimately selling to John for $1,000,000 is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale for me, and it's worth the slight loss in potential profit."
