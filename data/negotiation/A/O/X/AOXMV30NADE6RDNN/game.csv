"Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't sell the product for $80. It's worth significantly more than that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $115.  Let's find a middle ground!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
