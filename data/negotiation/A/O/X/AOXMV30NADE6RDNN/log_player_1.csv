"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal and you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum, but still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This creates some room for negotiation while also emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling the product for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell at that price, even if it means losing a sale to John. I'm still hopeful I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't sell the product for $80. It's worth significantly more than that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $115.  Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to stay within my budget, so I'm proposing to purchase the product for $95. This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I want to push for a higher price, and see if Bob is willing to come up slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose purchasing the product for $100. This would be a fair compromise between our prices and would allow me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $100 is still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and the negotiation is taking time. There's a risk that Bob might get frustrated and walk away, or I might run out of rounds and be forced to sell to John for a lower price.  Accepting $100 ensures a sale and a profit."
