"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a fair price for my product. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
