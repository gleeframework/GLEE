"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,050,000. This is my best offer, considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I must be candid that $1,050,000 falls short of the value this product represents.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
