"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair price that acknowledges its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is less than Alice's worth, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Therefore, it's better to reject the offer and see if a better deal can be negotiated."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I must be candid that $1,050,000 falls short of the value this product represents.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is lower than her original offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action."
