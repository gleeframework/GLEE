"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a ridiculous starting price. Alice is way too high. It's important to counter quickly and bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but claiming ""final offer"" this early is usually a bluff. We're still pretty far apart, so let's push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
