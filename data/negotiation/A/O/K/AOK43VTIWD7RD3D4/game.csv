"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. How about $10,500? This is a significant discount from my original offer, and still well below your estimated value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000.  How about we split the difference at $10,125?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10125.0,Alice,5,
