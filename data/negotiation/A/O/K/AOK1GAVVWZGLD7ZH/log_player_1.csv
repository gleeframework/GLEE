This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
