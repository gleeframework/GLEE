"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  $800,000 is a significant discount from the product's value to you, but you can likely get a better price. 
* **It's early in the negotiation.** You have 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should make a counteroffer that's still lower than Alice's offer, but higher than what you'd pay John. This will demonstrate your interest in the product while still trying to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is aggressive but reasonable:**  A $100,000 drop from Alice's offer is a significant step but still shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's early, so you can be bolder:** You still have plenty of rounds to adjust your offer if needed.
* **Focus on finding a price ""that works for both of us"":** This frames the negotiation as a collaborative process rather than a battle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $700,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** She's met you halfway, and you're already saving $250,000 from the original price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:** With only 7 rounds left, it's wise to take a good deal when offered. 

**Next Steps:**

While you're getting a good deal, you could still try to push for a slightly lower price in future rounds. However, be prepared to accept this offer if it's the best you can get."
