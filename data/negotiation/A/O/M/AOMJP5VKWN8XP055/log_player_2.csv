"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept the first offer.  By rejecting, I can see if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price.  If not, I can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This will test Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get it for $120, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, especially since I have a solid backup option with John.  Accepting $140 saves me $10 and keeps the deal moving forward."
