Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more than $8,000, but I'm still not willing to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach our $10,000 minimum. Selling to John guarantees we get our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation rounds."
