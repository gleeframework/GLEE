Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 saving compared to his perceived value, making it a tempting offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
