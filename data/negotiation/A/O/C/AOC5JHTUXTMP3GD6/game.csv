"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $9,200? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
