"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $1,500,000 to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's worth to me to build credibility and make the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to discussion and willing to compromise. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also keeping the negotiation open for potential adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $1350000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential to improve:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my ideal, potentially securing a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,400,000, emphasizing the value of the product and leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still looking to secure a price closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to consider your offer if we could meet in the middle at $1,375,000. This price reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the mutual benefit of the proposed price, fostering a sense of cooperation.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desired price and Bob's offer, while also creating a sense of urgency to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I am willing to pay $1360000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 lower than my previous counteroffer. It's getting closer to my ideal price point.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're already at round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob increases.
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, while rejecting it risks a counteroffer that could be even lower, or worse, no deal at all.

**Overall:** While $1,360,000 is not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential for lower offers or a failed negotiation in the remaining rounds."
