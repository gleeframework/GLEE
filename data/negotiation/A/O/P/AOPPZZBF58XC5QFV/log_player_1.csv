Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. Let me know if you're interested, as this offer won't last long!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially extract more value from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $20,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  He might be willing to pay slightly more than $8,000, especially if you highlight the product's benefits. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that the offer won't last long might encourage Bob to act quickly, making him less likely to overthink his decision.

**Important:**  While this strategy aims to maximize your profit, be prepared for Bob to reject the offer. You'll then sell to John at your guaranteed price."
