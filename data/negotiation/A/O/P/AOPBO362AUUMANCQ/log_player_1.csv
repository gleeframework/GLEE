Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Offer:** I'm offering the product at $1,500,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Profit:** This price gives me the opportunity to earn a greater profit if Bob accepts.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not risking a huge loss. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still maintaining a safety net."
