"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly unique and I believe it has immense potential for your needs.  I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, reflecting its value. I'm open to discussion, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1500000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is the maximum I can offer at this point. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I have 9 rounds left and can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at more than $1,000,000, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1,250,000.  This offers a significant value for you, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $1100000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, I'm concerned about running out of time. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a good price, and I can always try to sell to John for more in the future if the opportunity arises."
