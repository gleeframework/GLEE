"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you working with me.  To be completely transparent,  $22,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
