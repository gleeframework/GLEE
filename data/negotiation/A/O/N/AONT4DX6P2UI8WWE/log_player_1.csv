Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too low, considering the product's value to me and to him. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a significant discount from its true value to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can push for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. The negotiations with Bob have gone on for a while, and we're not getting any closer to a deal that meets my minimum price.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a secure option, and I'm not willing to risk losing that opportunity."
