"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $180 initially. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. If you're not willing to come down to that, I'm going to have to seriously consider going with John's offer.",140.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to squeeze every last penny out of me, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm now offering it to you for $155. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",155.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made some significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I'm now offering it to you for $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",150.0,Alice,7,,
