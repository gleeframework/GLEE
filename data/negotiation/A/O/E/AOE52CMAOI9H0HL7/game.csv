"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
