"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it will be a great asset to your business. My initial price is $950,000. Let's discuss this further!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $950,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a significant saving and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and $875,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference one more time.  How about $887,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $880,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my desired price and is only $2,500 less than my previous counteroffer.  The potential of losing the deal to John, or continuing to negotiate and risk a lower offer from Bob in the future makes this offer the best option."
