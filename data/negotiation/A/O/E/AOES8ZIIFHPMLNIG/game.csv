"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it will be a great asset to your business. My initial price is $950,000. Let's discuss this further!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a significant saving and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference one more time.  How about $887,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,6,
