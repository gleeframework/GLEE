We're getting close, but there's still room to negotiate!  Alice is coming down in price, so we'll keep pushing gently."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer it to you for $132. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to hold on to as much profit as possible, and while we might be able to squeeze out a dollar or two more, it's getting risky.  $132 is a good price and we've successfully negotiated down. Let's take the deal!"
