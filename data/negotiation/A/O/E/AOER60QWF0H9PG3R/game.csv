"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",135.0,Alice,5,
