"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still represents a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000, as I mentioned earlier. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
