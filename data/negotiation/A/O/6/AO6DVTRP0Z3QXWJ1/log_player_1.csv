Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting at $15,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum price of $10,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a good profit. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiating with him or to cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit. Given the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's offer of $10,000, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
