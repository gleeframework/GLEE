"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice has come down significantly, and while I could try to negotiate further, $800,000 is a reasonable price and saves me a substantial amount compared to John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
