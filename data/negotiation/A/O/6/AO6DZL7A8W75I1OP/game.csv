"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  I'm very interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could we work something out closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $750,000? That would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
