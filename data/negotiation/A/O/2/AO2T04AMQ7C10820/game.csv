Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and potential for long-term growth.,850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $750000. Considering the product's unique features and my initial investment, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",800000.0,Alice,3,
