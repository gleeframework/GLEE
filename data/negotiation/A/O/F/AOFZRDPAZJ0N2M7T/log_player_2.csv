"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is $1,000,000 to you. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and it's a significant saving compared to buying from John."
