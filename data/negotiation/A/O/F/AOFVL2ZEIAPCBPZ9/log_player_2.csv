"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $22,000 is far more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget, I'm happy to offer $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is still far more than Bob's maximum budget.  There is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution.  However,  $10,000 is still less than I can accept.  Would you be willing to consider $15,000?  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  $15,000 is still outside of Bob's budget, and while it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for Bob. Since John is selling the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the best option for Bob."
