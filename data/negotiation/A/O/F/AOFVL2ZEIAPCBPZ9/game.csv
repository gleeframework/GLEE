"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so feel free to share your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget, I'm happy to offer $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution.  However,  $10,000 is still less than I can accept.  Would you be willing to consider $15,000?  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",15000.0,Alice,5,
