"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's still a bit high considering the value I can get from it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, so I'm offering it to you for $915000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to give me a discount, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable paying $915000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $890000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I may need to consider buying from John for $1000000.",890000.0,Bob,6,
