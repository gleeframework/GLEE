"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its potential and is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging your offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I think this price is more reasonable and allows us to meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,350,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this round.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,380,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000. I think this price is more in line with my budget and still reflects the value of the product.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
