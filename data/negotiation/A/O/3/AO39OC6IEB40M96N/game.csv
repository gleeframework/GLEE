"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is a substantial amount and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, the $1,200,000 offer is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  I'll accept $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to a deal.  Let's aim for a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
