{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but below my minimum acceptable price.  This allows room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. This shows flexibility while also pushing for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000, which is closer to my limit. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial goal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250?  It's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11250}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise, while still trying to maximize my profit."
