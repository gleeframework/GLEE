"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11250?  It's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",11250.0,Alice,5,
