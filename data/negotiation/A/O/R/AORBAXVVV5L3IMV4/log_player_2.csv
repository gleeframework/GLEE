Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your limit. You can likely negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11250?  It's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

While $11,250 is closer to your limit, it's still above your ideal price. It's more worthwhile to buy from John and save $250."
