Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

Since I am Alice, and I know that I can sell the product to John for $12,000, I will offer Bob the same price. There is no incentive for me to offer a lower price, as I can always sell to John for my minimum desired price.  While Bob values the product at $8,000, it is still a good deal for him if he is willing to pay $12,000. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings."
