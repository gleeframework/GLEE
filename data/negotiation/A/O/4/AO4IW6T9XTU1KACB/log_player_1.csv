Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than John's offer.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's ""potential value"" and ""significant benefits"" reinforces the price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and value the product more.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Alice could aim lower to guarantee a sale, but the current offer balances risk and potential reward."
