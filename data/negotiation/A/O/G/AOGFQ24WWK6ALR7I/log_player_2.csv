"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** $120
* **John's Offer:** $150

Buying from Alice saves Bob $30 compared to buying from John.  Even though it's more than the product's worth to Alice, it's still a good deal for Bob."
