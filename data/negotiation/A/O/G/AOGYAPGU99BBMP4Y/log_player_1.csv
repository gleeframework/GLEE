``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take $12,200, I think I can still push for a slightly higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
