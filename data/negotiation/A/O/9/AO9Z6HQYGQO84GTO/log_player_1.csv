Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** This helps build rapport and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

**Strategy:**

This offer sets the stage for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **I'm not desperate for a sale:** I have a backup buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob has expressed interest in the product and is willing to pay above his initial valuation, suggesting he's open to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired $14,000. I'll aim for a middle ground that still offers me a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me make sure I'm getting a good return on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a midpoint between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Highlighting the value:** The message emphasizes that $13,250 is a fair price considering the value of the product, making it more attractive to Bob.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I'm not losing money on the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is strategically positioned to entice Bob into accepting.  If he rejects, I'll need to carefully assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $12,750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **I'm not willing to compromise further:** Continuing to negotiate risks lowering the price even more, potentially resulting in a loss for me.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John provides the most secure and profitable outcome, guaranteeing my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise on my minimum requirements."
