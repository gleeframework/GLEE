{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is greater than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), making it likely he'll consider it. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have space to negotiate a final price that is mutually beneficial.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below your ideal price.  You have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your desired $120.  Let's see if you can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $97 is a good deal for you. It's above your minimum of $80 and closer to your desired $120.  It's also likely the best offer you'll get from Bob, considering he's already come down to $97 from his initial counteroffer of $90.  Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
