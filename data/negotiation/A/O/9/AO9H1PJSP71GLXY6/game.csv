"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion.  While $1,250,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it falls short of reflecting the true value this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you partway, but I think $1,275,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to pay that amount.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
