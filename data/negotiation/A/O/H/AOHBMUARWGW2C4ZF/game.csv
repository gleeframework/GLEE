"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true market value. I've had substantial interest in this product, and to be completely transparent, I have another offer closer to my asking price. However, I value this negotiation and believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
