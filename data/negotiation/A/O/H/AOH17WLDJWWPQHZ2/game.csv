"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a living, you know. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but the price remains at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
