# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, given its potential.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  
* **Reasonable Offer:** $750,000 is still a good amount, showing Bob is serious about the product.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message highlights the potential value and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $825000, which is a 10% discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's still room to lower the price further.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making him a safe alternative. 

By rejecting this offer, Bob can try to get closer to his target price while maintaining the possibility of buying from John if the deal falls through."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm very interested in this product.  How about $800,000?  It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $815000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice's offer is only $15,000 less than John's price.  
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Alice has indicated she won't go lower than $815,000, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Further Delays:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rounds, potentially increasing the risk of missing out on the deal altogether or facing more counteroffers that are higher than John's price.
