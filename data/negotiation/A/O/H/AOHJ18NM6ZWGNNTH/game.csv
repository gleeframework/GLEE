"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, given its potential.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $825000, which is a 10% discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $825000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm very interested in this product.  How about $800000?  It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $815000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",815000.0,Alice,5,
