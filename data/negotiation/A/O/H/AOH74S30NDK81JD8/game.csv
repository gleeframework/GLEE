"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that price is tempting, I believe the product's true value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, don't you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,375,000 is still a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
