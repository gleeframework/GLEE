"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for myself.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go up to $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to come down to $915,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll find the product valuable enough to be worth it.",915000.0,Alice,5,
