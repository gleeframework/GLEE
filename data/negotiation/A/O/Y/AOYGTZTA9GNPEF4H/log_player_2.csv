"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  Alice's offer of $925,000 is closer to his target, but there's still room to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to compromise a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go up to $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to come down to $915,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll find the product valuable enough to be worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $915,000, which is closer to Bob's target price of $900,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away entirely. It's likely that another counteroffer will lead to a stalemate. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
