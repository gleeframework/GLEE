"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $650,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",650000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, I think $650,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $550,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $550,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us.",600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $600,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could we settle at $575,000? That would make this deal very attractive to me.",575000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $575,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $585,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us.",585000.0,Alice,5,
