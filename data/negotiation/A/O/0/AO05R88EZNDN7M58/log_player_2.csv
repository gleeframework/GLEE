"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I definitely see the value in this product. However, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  It's worth rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer, keeping in mind that he can always buy from John if the negotiations go sour."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000. This is a significant step closer to your original offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's good for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a significant step closer to my original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob. He's already lowered the price significantly, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise.  Accepting the offer at $825,000 saves him a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
