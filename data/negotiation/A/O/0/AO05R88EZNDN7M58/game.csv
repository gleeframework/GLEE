"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I definitely see the value in this product. However, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000. This is a significant step closer to your original offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's good for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a significant step closer to my original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
