"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  I'm aware that this might be a high starting point, but I want to see how much value he places on the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial price, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target value. I believe this offer is fair and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering I'm already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting now ensures I get a price higher than selling to John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially ending in a lower price or having to sell to John as a last resort."
