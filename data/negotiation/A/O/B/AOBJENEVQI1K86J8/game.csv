"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15000.  Would you be willing to negotiate to that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $17500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17500 is still outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go to $16000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're able to accept it.",16000.0,Bob,4,
