"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15000.  Would you be willing to negotiate to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17500 is still outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go to $16000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're able to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $16,000 is close to my initial asking price and it's a good deal for me.  I'd rather close the deal with Bob than risk losing him and having to sell to John for less."
