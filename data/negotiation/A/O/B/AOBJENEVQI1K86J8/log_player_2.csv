"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is too high.  $20,000 is above my maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate to that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $17500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $17,500 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, so I'll see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,500 is still outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go to $16,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're able to accept it."", ""product_price"": 16000}
