"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can do better than $130.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's still above Alice's minimum value, but lower than her initial offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

``` 
Alice is getting closer to your price point, but you can still do better than $135.  Let's try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 130}
``` 
Let's split the difference and see if Alice will accept.  This price is still a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $132 is just slightly above your last counteroffer, and closer to your desired price point. While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice will hold firm at $132, and you might end up paying more. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids risking a further increase in price."
