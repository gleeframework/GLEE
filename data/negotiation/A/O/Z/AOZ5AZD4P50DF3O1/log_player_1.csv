Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the benefit for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $1,200,000 is far enough from my minimum to allow for several rounds of counteroffers.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Bob is known to be a tough negotiator, I might start even higher.
* **Time Pressure:** If I need to sell the product quickly, I may be more willing to accept a lower price. 
* **John's Availability:**  If John's offer is time-sensitive, I'll need to consider that in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is appealing, I haven't exhausted all options with Bob yet. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This allows me to move forward while staying within your budget as well.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize that the compromise works for both of us.
* **Keeping Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, there's still some wiggle room if Bob is unwilling to go up further.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If Bob is known to be stubborn, I might need to adjust my counteroffer accordingly.
* **Time Pressure:**  If I need to close the deal quickly, I might be more willing to accept a lower price.
* **John's Offer:**  I need to balance the potential of getting a higher price from Bob with the security of John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, I believe I can still get a better offer by counter-offering.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer remains a strong safety net, giving me the confidence to continue negotiations. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  However,  I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $975,000? This is a small increase for you, but it would make a big difference for me.  Let me know if you're open to this final compromise."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm only asking for a $25,000 increase from Bob's last offer, making it a more palatable jump.
* **Final Compromise:** I'm framing this as a final compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $975,000 is still significantly above my minimum, but it's getting closer to a point where I might be willing to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If Bob is known to be stubborn, I might need to be more flexible.
* **Time Pressure:**  If I need to close the deal quickly, I might be more willing to accept a lower price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is secure, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
