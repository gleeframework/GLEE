"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This allows me to move forward while staying within your budget as well.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  However,  I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $975,000? This is a small increase for you, but it would make a big difference for me.  Let me know if you're open to this final compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
