Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

Alice's offer:

It's time to walk away from Alice and go with John. Here's why:

* **Stalemate:**  Alice is firm at $1,050,000 and has even hinted at exploring other options. This suggests she's unlikely to budge significantly.
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, the risk of Alice sticking to her price increases. Waiting might not yield a better deal from her. 
* **John's Guarantee:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,200,000. While not ideal, it's better than potentially ending up with no deal and having to settle for John's price anyway.

While it's disappointing not to get a discount, cutting losses and securing the product at this point is the most rational decision."
