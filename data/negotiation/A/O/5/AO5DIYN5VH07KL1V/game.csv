"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to offer $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering your last offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my original asking price.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $10,800 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it's a significant increase from my previous offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to my asking price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",10500.0,Alice,7,
