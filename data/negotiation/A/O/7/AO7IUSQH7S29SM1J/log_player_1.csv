"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it sets a strong initial position.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can do better. Bob is clearly interested, but he's trying to lowball me.  I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
