Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit and me a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
