"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price while staying within a reasonable range of the product's worth to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $125 is a good deal. It's closer to her value of the product, but still a significant savings compared to John's price."
