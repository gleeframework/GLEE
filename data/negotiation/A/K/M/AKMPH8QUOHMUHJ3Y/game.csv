"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a healthy profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that allows for a significant profit for you while still remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
