Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price closer to $150 maximizes your potential profit, while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $80 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.

By starting at $120, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, but still secure a significant profit above your minimum."
