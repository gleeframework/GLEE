"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $2,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit off. Would you be open to $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your interest but there's still a gap between our valuations.  I can go down to $1,850,000 as a final effort to reach a deal. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me. That last offer was closer, but I need to be realistic with my budget. Would you consider $1,425,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
