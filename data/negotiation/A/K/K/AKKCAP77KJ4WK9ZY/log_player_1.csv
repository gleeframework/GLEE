"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm open to counteroffers, knowing that Bob may not accept the first offer.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation room:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does show his interest and opens up room for further negotiation.  
* **Avoiding immediate sale:**  While selling to John for $150 is tempting, I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob, given that he's already expressed interest. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Positive message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and highlighting the ""fairness"" of the compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that he will still be getting a good deal, even at the higher price.

By offering a compromise and emphasizing fairness, I aim to make Bob more likely to accept my counteroffer and avoid the need to keep negotiating further."
