{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to accept since it's below his maximum budget, Bob can potentially get a better deal. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows he can buy from John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. He wants to see if Alice is willing to come down considerably. This also signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is not willing to overpay."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, but only slightly. He's slowly moving towards Alice's price, showing his willingness to negotiate while still trying to get the best price. This strategy balances the risk of losing the deal with the goal of getting a lower price.  Since there are only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to be mindful of his time but also not rush into a deal that's too high for him."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above what he could get from John.  With only three rounds remaining, Bob still has a chance to negotiate further.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing the negotiation closer to his goal. He's increasing his offer to $1,110,000, which is closer to Alice's offer of $1,150,000. With only two rounds remaining, he needs to be careful not to lose the deal but also wants to get the best price possible. This counteroffer shows his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below his maximum budget."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

* This is the last round of negotiation with Alice.
* Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is still higher than what Bob can buy the product for from John at $1,000,000.

It's better for Bob to secure the product at a lower price from John rather than risk losing the deal with Alice and ending up with a higher price."
