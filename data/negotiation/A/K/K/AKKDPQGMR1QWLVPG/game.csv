"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm still pretty far off from that number, but to show I'm serious I could do $9,500.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 to make this deal happen. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
