Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?

I'll reject Bob's offer of $9,000.  It's too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
