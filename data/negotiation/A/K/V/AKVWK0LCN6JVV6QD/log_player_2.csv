"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum price point as possible.  He is making a counter offer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's maximum price point than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  He can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door to another round of negotiation and hopefully a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible, but he's also showing flexibility.  This counteroffer is slightly higher than his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good price.  $8,750 is closer to his desired price and provides a reasonable middle ground for negotiation."
