"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and what similar products are on the market. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",900000.0,Alice,1,
