"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and what similar products are on the market. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

Alice is coming down in price, but you can still likely get a better deal.  You're only $50,000 away from your ideal price of $800,000.  Rejecting and counter-offering again might lead to a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $850,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
