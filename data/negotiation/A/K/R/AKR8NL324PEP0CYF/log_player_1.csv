Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, giving you a healthy profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $1,200,000 is less than the $1,500,000 Bob values the product at, making it attractive for him to accept.
* **It allows room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob counteroffers.

This strategy aims to reach a deal quickly while leaving room for negotiation if needed.  Keep in mind, you can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is still a good profit, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price.  I'll aim for something closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to reach a number that's closer to the initial $1,200,000 I proposed.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:**  $1,100,000 is still a good profit for you and it keeps the negotiation moving in the direction you want. 
* **Demonstrate flexibility:**  By reducing your price slightly, you show a willingness to compromise.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, you can still drop the price a little more without going below your minimum.

Remember, you can always sell to John for $800,000 if you feel like the negotiations with Bob aren't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good opportunity to close the deal. While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my desired price, it's still a significant profit and above my minimum.  Bob is clearly willing to pay a decent amount, and it's not worth risking losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can make up for the slight loss in profit through other transactions."
