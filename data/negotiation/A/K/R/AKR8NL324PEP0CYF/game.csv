"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to reach a number that's closer to the initial $1,200,000 I proposed.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
