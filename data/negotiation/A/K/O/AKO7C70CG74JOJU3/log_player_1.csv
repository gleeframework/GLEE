Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by acknowledging the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $110 is still a little low for me. How about $115? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
