Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential back and forth.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a specific price, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your consideration. However, I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for him.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's still room for a counteroffer that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand your position, I still believe $800,000 would be a fair price for the product. I'm willing to stick to my original offer. Please let me know if there's any way we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is firmly set on his $800,000 offer, which is your minimum.  At this point, further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a higher price.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures a quick and secure sale, guaranteeing you meet your minimum goal."
