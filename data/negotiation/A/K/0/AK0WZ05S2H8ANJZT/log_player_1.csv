Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left,  I'm running out of time and the negotiation isn't moving fast enough towards my desired price.  While $8,400 is better than Bob's previous offers, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm also worried that Bob might not be willing to budge much further, leaving me with a very low profit.  Therefore, I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000 to guarantee my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation."
