Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $170. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth more. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  While Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product as valuable. This offer helps gauge his interest.
* **Fallback Option:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything."
