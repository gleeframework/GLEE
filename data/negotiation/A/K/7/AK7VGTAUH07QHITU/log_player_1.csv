Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the excellent condition of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. That's still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $82.5 is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
