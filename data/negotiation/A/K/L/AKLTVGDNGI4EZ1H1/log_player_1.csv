Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to negotiate if he thinks the price is too high, which might lead to a better deal for you. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $12,000. 

This approach allows you to maximize your potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially securing a higher price."
