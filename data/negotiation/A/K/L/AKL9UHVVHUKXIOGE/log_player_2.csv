Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's starting offer is closer to your maximum than her minimum, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price closer to Alice's value of $80, while still leaving room for further negotiation.  The message is polite and expresses continued interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we can likely do better. Let's see if we can get the price down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $88?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($92.50) and our previous counteroffer ($85). It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that she's nearing her bottom line.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's getting risky. Accepting at $90 saves us $30 compared to John's offer and is a reasonable compromise."
