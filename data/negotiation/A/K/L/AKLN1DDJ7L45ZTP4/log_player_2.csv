"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount, considering its value to you is $80. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal since it's below your maximum budget and provides some savings. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price by negotiating further, especially since Alice knows the product is worth $80 to you."
