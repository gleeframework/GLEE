"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer opens the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, and a $3,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate, but not so low that it seems unreasonable or insulting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting the offer at $14,000 saves $1,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price. It's a good balance between securing a deal and potentially losing out on a better offer from John."
