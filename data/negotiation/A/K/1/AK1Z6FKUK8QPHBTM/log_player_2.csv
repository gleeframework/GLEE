Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to accept. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's offering me $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $1,300,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal. Please consider it carefully.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is trying to get me to meet her price, but I'm not willing to go that high. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option. However, I'll make one last counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down one last time.

{""message"": ""I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you.

This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
