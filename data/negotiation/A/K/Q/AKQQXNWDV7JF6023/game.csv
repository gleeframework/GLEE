"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $75,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the true value to me, and it's the best I can offer.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $15,000.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
