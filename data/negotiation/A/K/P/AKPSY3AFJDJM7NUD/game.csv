"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still too high. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
