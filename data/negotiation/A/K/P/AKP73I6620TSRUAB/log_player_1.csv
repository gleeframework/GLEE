Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my ideal price.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,600,000. This is a good compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price for the product.  I'll see if he's willing to come up to my price, or if we need to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,500,000, which is a decent price and closer to what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to accept his offer and finalize the sale. There's always a risk that I might be able to get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, but I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
