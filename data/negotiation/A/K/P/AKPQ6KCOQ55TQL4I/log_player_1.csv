Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects a fair price considering its potential value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob's valuation of $1,200,000 presents an opportunity to earn significantly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a substantial profit. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** There's always a chance Bob could reject the offer and go with a competitor. However, the potential reward of an extra $300,000 (compared to selling to John) justifies the slight risk.

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase your chances of securing a deal that maximizes your profit."
