Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a bit above your minimum price of $8,000, leaving some room for negotiation, but it's also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000.  This should encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price and it's better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's a good deal, so I'll accept it."
