{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot more, so I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$140:** This is a price that is above my minimum ($120) but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's likely that Bob will counteroffer, but it's a good starting point. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and conversational message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than John's ($130 vs. $120), it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest! While $130 is a good price, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a bit closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$135:** This price is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($130). 
* **Message:**  The message continues to be friendly and emphasizes the value Bob is getting at this price. It also avoids being overly aggressive, encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $132 is still slightly below my ideal price, it's very close and significantly better than selling to John for $120. It's likely that Bob won't budge further, so accepting his offer is the best choice in this situation."
