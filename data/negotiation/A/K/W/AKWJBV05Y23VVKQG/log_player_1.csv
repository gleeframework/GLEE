``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price close to your minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think about $1,050,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your ideal price. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,150,000 is my lowest counter offer. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and I think it's close enough to your counteroffer for us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not get you a significantly better deal.  While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and secures a price that is reasonably close to your desired value."
