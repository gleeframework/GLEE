"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $1,000,000. While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for you. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John if you can't get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point of $1,000,000. It's getting closer, but it's still not a good deal for me. I will try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer. If I can't get a better price, I will buy from John."
