"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exceptional product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's aim for a swift and agreeable outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my revised counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to getting the best possible deal, and I respect that.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit above my minimum. Let's aim for a win-win.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This price allows me to  cover my costs while ensuring you get a product that will significantly benefit your business.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
