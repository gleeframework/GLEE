# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than her product valuation, it's still more than your maximum budget and more importantly, more expensive than buying from John. You can save $150,000 by going with John."
