"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's room for me to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, but I'm still aiming for a profit.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $12,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) than my initial offer. This suggests Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I have a chance to secure a better price.
* **John's offer as leverage:** I have John's offer as a safety net, so I don't have to settle for an unfavorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is still a great price for a product of this quality.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still profitable:** $9,750 is still above my minimum acceptable price and represents a good profit.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  While I'm lowering the price, I'm still not giving in completely.  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  $9,600 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept.
* **Small increments:** Bob's offer is only a small increase from his previous offer. This suggests he's pushing for a lower price but might be willing to go slightly higher.
* **Maintain pressure:** I'm not settling yet, hoping to get a better price.  My backup option with John gives me the power to hold firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $9,650. This is a very fair price, considering the value of this product. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9650} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer again. This shows flexibility while still moving towards a profitable price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to close the deal.
* **Finality:**  I'm hinting at this being my final offer, increasing pressure on Bob to accept.
* **John's offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback, but I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob."
