"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to incentivize him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:** The $12,000 price point allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations without immediately hitting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer for $15,000 gives me leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12,000. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can still negotiate with Bob. I'm willing to try to meet him somewhere in the middle, but not at $9,000. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Knowing John will buy for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob again, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Middle Ground:**  $11,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price and have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still potential for negotiation, and I can try to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **John's Offer Provides Security:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $10,250 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm showing further flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price higher than his perceived value.
* **Midpoint Calculation:** $10,250 is the midpoint between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Finality and Incentive:**  I'm suggesting that this could be the final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leverage Remains:** I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make a final compromise and accept $10,000 for the product.  This is a great price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We are in round 8, and time is running out.
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's final offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000.
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might not counter, or he might counter with a lower price, pushing me further away from my target. 

**Conclusion:**  It's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the $15,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
