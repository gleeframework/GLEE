"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial value, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  There's no reason to immediately jump to John's offer when Bob might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Bob is offering $8,500, which is still within his budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price. This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while also ensuring a significant savings for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $9,500 is higher than his ideal price, it's still within his budget and a significant savings compared to Alice's initial asking price.  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, leaving Bob with only John's higher price option."
