I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, and I believe it is attractive enough for Bob to consider.  

I am prepared to negotiate further if he rejects the offer, but I am also aware of the alternative buyer, John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it is closer to my minimum, I am not willing to accept it. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $14,000. This is still a significant discount from my minimum price, but it reflects the fact that Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to his own valuation of the product. It's not worth continuing the negotiation further. I will sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoid further negotiation hassle."
