{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you'd like to pay, but it's closer to your target. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can push the price down closer to your desired range before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, and you've already made several counteroffers. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better result.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, saving you time and potentially avoiding further back-and-forth with Alice."
