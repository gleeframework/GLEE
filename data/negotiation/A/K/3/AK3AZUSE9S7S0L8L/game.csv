"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. Can you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the $1200000 I was initially offering. I'll meet you at $1150000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1150000. I'm willing to go up to $1120000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1120000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'll meet you at $1130000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer on this round. What do you think?",1130000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $1130000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1110000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
