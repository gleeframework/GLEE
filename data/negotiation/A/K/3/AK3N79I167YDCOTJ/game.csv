"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
