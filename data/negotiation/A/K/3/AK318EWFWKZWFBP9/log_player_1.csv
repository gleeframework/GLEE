Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm starting the offer at $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I've already established that I'm comfortable with that price with John.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potential losses."
