# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer opens the opportunity to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. That's still a great deal for a product worth $150 to you! Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer.  It's worth accepting this offer to save money and get the product."
