"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good price, it's always worth exploring if you can get it lower.  By rejecting the offer, Bob opens the opportunity to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $7,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and sets the stage for a negotiation.  This counteroffer is aggressive but within the realm of reason, considering Bob's maximum budget of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $8,500, the deal is within a reasonable range for Bob, especially considering he has 7 rounds left to potentially negotiate further.  Accepting the offer now ensures Bob secures the product while still saving a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
