# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Since Alice's offer is $150, which is the same price as John's, you might as well accept Alice's offer. There's no benefit to waiting for John."
