"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it at exactly that price.  There's no immediate advantage to accepting her offer, as you can get the same product from John for the same price.  By rejecting, you might be able to open the door for Alice to lower the price to make the sale."
