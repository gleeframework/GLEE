,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $180. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit shy of $180. Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a fair profit. I can offer you the product for $160. It's a good middle ground, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",160.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $140. I think that's the lowest I can go and still make a fair profit. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we meet at $140?",140.0,Alice,7,
