"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I understand this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a price that is fair for both of us. Please consider my offer of $900,000. This is a substantial price, and I believe it represents a significant opportunity for you.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
