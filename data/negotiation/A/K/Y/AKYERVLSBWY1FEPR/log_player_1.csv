Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a decent return on your investment.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It leaves room for back-and-forth negotiations without feeling too extreme.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if you feel you're not getting a good enough deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum valuation. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price than accepting his offer. You can still walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if you can't reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I'm thinking closer to $12,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undervalues your product.
* **Offers a compromise:** $12,500 is halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Highlights the value:** You remind Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to your minimum valuation and is a good deal for you.  It's better to accept his offer than to risk another round of negotiation that could lead to him walking away or you selling to John for a slightly higher price."
