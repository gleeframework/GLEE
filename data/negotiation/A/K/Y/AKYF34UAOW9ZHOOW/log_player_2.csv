"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's room to bargain with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $85. This is a fair price, considering I can get it for $80 from John. It also gives Alice a chance to make a profit, as the product is worth $100 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Alice is only willing to go down $5 from her original price. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with her, as I can get the product from John for $80."
