"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the potential benefits I believe you'll realize from owning it.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can definitely try to negotiate a better price."
