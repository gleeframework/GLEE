Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at the special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below your minimum ($100).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 creates a sense of a discount while still securing a profit. 
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By emphasizing that Bob has the first opportunity, you add a subtle pressure to accept before he potentially misses out. 

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You make a $95 profit, which is better than selling to John.
* **If Bob rejects:** You sell to John for $100, meeting your minimum."
