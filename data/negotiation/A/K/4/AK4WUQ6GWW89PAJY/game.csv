"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price would still be a good deal for you, as it is significantly above your valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
