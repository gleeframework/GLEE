Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price would still be a good deal for you, as it is significantly above your valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
