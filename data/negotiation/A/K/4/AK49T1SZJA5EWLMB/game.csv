"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit Alice, how about we settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
