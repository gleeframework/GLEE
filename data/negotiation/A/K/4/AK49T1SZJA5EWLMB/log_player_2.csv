Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to budge below $12,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for a potential savings of only $2,500.  Buying from John for $15,000 ensures I get the product without further haggling."
