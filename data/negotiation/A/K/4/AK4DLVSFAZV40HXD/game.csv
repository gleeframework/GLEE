"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is good, but not quite that good. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, that offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This reflects the product's unique nature and potential for a significant return on investment. What do you say?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, meeting in the middle seems fair. To show you I'm serious about getting this done, let's make it $1,725,000. This price reflects the value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000 to try and find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
