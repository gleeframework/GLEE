"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
