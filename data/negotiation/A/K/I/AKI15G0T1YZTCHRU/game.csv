"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget.  While I acknowledge the value of this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $2,100,000? This still reflects the exceptional value you're gaining.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $2,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's try to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to a reasonable range, it still doesn't reflect the full value of this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,850,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
