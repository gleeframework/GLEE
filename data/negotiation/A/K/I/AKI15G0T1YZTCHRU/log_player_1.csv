Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,300,000 is still a considerable profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer throughout the negotiation, demonstrating genuine interest.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the potential loss of selling to John. 

Accepting this offer represents a strong balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
