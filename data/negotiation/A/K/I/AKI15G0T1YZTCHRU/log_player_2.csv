Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $2,100,000? This still reflects the exceptional value you're gaining.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to a reasonable range, it still doesn't reflect the full value of this product.
