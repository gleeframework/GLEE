"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better deal.  It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob can save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is well below Alice's initial price, leaving room for a potential compromise. This aggressive approach aims to secure a lower price without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than his initial counteroffer and significantly lower than John's price. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, forcing Bob to pay John's higher price.  Accepting the offer guarantees a purchase below his budget and a decent saving."
