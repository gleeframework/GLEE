"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's try to finalize this deal - I'm ready to make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,550,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given the value and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
