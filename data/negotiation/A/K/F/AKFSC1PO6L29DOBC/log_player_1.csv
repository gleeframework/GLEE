"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $95 is better than his initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $105? That's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I believe I can get closer to my minimum with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering the value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $105 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're both pretty close to agreeing on a price. How about $109? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding. Considering the value of the product and staying within my budget, I would like to propose a price of $107. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $107 is still less than my desired price, with only 2 rounds left, I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better offer from Bob. Also, selling to John for $120 feels too risky as it is uncertain if Bob will accept my final counteroffer in the next round. Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $107."
