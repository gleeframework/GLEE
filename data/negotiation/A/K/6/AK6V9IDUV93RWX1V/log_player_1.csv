Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $180 is a reasonable markup from your minimum price and leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Potential for Higher Gain:** While there's a chance Bob might reject this price, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn $30 more than selling to John."
