Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point considering the product's worth to me and to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer and is closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  John offers a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum acceptable price."
