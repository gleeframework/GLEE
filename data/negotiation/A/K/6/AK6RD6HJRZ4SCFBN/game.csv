"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, considering your value is $10000. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
