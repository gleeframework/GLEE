"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and I'm confident this product will bring value to my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for me, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for your business. Let's aim for a win-win solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure this product will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's get this done.",950000.0,Alice,5,
