Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my previous offer. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm willing to go up slightly to $7,800. That's a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He is using the existence of John as leverage and his offers are not approaching a point where further negotiation seems fruitful. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for Alice at this stage."
