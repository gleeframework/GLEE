"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product. However, I think $12,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway. How about we try $10,200? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate that. However, I need to stay closer to my original budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,900? That's a fair compromise and would allow me to purchase the product today.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you halfway. How about we try $10,400? This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",10400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you accept $10,150 for the product?",10150.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,150. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we try $10,350? This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",10350.0,Alice,9,
