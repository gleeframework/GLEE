Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so I don't want to go any lower than that. 

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
