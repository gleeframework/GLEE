Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Knowing its value, I'm offering it at $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $925,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for you. It leaves a $75,000 buffer before Bob would be better off refusing and letting you go to John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price enticing enough for Bob to accept and profitable enough to maximize your potential earnings."
