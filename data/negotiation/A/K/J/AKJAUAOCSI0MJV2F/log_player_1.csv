Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Your Backup:** John will pay $1,000,000

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, knowing Bob values the product more than you do. However, being too greedy could lead to Bob rejecting the offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's framed positively, highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to appeal to Bob.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to still gain ($50,000) while you secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you believe Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price, fostering goodwill for future interactions.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy ready."
