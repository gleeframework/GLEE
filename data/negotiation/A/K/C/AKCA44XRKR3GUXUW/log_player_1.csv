{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at over $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a starting price of $1,000,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the value I'm placing on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I'm asking for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price and exceeds my minimum value of $800,000. It's time to close the deal!"
