"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to be the first to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my best and final offer. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point.  While $1,200,000 isn't ideal, I'm willing to consider offers closer to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's true value and offers a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to look at other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
