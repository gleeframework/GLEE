,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $140, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $130.  It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,135.0
"I'm not sure I can meet you exactly in the middle, Bob, but I can try to get closer to your price. How about $135? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Let's settle at $132.50. It's just a small difference and we can finalize the deal.",132.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,135.0
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this deal. I'll meet you halfway between $135 and $132.50. How about $133.75? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",133.75,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, we're getting close, but I'm still a bit over budget. Let's try $132.  This way, we can both be happy with the deal and move forward.",132.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,134.0
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $132, Bob. I think we can meet in the middle of $132 and $133.75. How about $133? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",133.0,Alice,9,,
