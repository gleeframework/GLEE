""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To kick things off, I propose a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, and finding a solution that works for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls short of your minimum acceptable price. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It makes the most financial sense to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
