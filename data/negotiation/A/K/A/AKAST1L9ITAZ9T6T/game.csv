"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1450000.0,Bob,2,
