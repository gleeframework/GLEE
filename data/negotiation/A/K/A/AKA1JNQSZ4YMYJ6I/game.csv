"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still think the product is worth a bit more to you. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can meet me here.",8200.0,Alice,5,
