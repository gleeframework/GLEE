# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
