**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, his increments are small, and he's consistently rejecting our counteroffers.  We're now at Round 8, leaving little room for significant movement. It's highly likely he won't meet our $1,700,000 bottom line. 

Selling to John guarantees our desired profit and avoids the risk of Bob's lowballing in the remaining rounds."
