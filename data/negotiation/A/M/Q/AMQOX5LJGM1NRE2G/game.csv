"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, the price of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This would allow us both to reach an agreeable agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far from where I see the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to you, I believe a price of $1,200,000 represents a fair compromise.  I'm confident this price would allow us both to come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is still under my ideal price, I understand the need to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal but recognizes the product's true worth.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to split the difference -  $1,400,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
