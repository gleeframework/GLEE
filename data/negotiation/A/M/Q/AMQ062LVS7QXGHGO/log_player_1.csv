Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a great starting point.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
