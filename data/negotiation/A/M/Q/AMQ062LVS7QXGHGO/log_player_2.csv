"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Since you're aiming to save as much as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a great starting point.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his goal is to save as much as possible.  While further negotiation could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further is too high.  Accepting the offer at $1,100,000 secures a good deal and avoids potential complications."
