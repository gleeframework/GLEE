"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is a little low for what I had in mind, I understand you have a budget. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to do $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
