"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that the product will be valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs and leave me with a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price still allows you a significant value from the product, and it's fair for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
