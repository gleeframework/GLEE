"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's starting price is a good sign, but there's room for negotiation. I should counter-offer with a lower price and see if she's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counter-offer a little above Alice's value ($100). This leaves room for further negotiation but shows I'm serious about buying at a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about $115? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on this product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle, but I think there's still some wiggle room. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This offer keeps the negotiation moving and lands us at a price that's beneficial for both of us if she accepts."
