"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,012,500. It's a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
