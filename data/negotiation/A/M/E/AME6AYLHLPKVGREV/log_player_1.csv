"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  While I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility while still leaving some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that low of a price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about closing a deal, but it still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept before we run out of rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  To ensure I secure a profit, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
