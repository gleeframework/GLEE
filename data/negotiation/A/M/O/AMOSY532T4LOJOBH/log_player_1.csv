Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation to see if I can get a better deal.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'll also keep John in mind as an option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum valuation. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that's good for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my initial asking price, it's a fair deal that's closer to my minimum valuation. It's also more than what John is offering. I'd rather sell to Bob than risk further negotiation and potential deadlock, especially since I can always sell to John as a last resort."
