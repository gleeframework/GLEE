Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum of $80. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion, which encourages Bob to counteroffer if he's interested. 

**Strategy:** 

* **Maximize Profit:** I'll use this initial offer to gauge Bob's interest and potential buying power. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $80 gives me a floor for my negotiation. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  There's no real benefit to continuing the negotiation. Even if I reject his offer, it's likely he won't budge much further. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting his offer avoids further rounds of negotiation, which could waste time and potentially lead to a worse outcome. 

**Strategy:**

* **Quick Sale:** This is a quick and easy way to secure the minimum value I'm willing to accept. 
* **Risk Aversion:**  While I could potentially get a higher price by counter-offering, there's also the risk of Bob backing out entirely or refusing further negotiations."
