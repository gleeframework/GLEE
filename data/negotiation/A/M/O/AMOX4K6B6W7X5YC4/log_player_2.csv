Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go below $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings you.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth and we can finalize this deal.
