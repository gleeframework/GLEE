"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,750,000 reflects its potential. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show my commitment to working with you.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment.  Let's make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the market conditions.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go below $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings you.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth and we can finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to stick to your original price, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and the price John is offering.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
