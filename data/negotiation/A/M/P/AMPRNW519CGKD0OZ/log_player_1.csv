"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario where we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to my preferred price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  This would allow us both to come away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I believe $13500 is still a bit high for me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal now, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $14,000. We've only had four rounds, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $13,000 is just a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $13,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and while I'd like to get closer to my target price, accepting this offer is the best option. Bob's counteroffer is only $100 lower than my last one, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower profit."
