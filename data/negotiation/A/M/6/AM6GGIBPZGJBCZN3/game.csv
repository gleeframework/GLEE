"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. However, I need to make a fair profit, considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is still fair considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you as well.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1,300,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer for now.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. Let's close this deal at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll meet you at $1,325,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to start considering other options.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
