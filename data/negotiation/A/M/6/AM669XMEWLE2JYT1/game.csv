"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can do $820,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $820,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could we settle on $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price by $180,000 from the original offer. I can do $780,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm willing to make a compromise.",780000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $765,000 and close the deal?",765000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I can do $790,000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value.",790000.0,Alice,7,
