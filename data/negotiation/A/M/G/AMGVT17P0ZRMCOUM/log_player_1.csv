While $980,000 is closer to my target, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000 just yet. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a higher offer from Bob. It's getting close to my target, but I'm hesitant to risk it. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
