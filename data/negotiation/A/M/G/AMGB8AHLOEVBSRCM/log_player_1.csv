"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate up. This gives me room to lower the price if needed.  It also establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target.  There are still many rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a price closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is getting closer to Bob's value for the product, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to be sure I'm not settling for less than I can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm making another small compromise, bringing my offer down to $9,500. This shows I'm flexible and willing to meet in the middle. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good opportunity to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge.  I've already made multiple concessions, and he's still offering a price below my minimum.  With only a few rounds left, I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
