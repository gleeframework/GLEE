"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? That would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
