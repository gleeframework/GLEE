Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I believe I can't exceed $10,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still believe $10,000 is the maximum I can afford for this product. Could we possibly reach an agreement at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is firmly rooted at $10,000.  There's no indication he'll budge, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the product's value without potentially wasting more time."
