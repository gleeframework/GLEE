Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I think this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to his valuation as possible without going over, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John, which gives you leverage.

By starting at $925,000, you leave room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still securing a significantly higher price than your backup offer."
