"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a little more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to do $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",92.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $88?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the best price I can offer. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $90. If not, I'll consider other options.",90.0,Alice,5,
