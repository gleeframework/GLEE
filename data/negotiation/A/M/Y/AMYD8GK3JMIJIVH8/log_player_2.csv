Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer it to you at $1,050,000. This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the unique benefits this product offers.
