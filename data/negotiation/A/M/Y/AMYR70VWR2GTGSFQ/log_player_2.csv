Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's getting closer, it's still not within my budget. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80."
