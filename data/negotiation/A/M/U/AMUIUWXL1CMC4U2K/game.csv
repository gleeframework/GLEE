"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $75. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $85. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested!",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $85. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",82.5,Bob,4,

"I understand your hesitation, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $82.50.
