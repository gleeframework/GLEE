Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum:**  I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I need to aim higher.
* **Unknown value to Bob:** I don't know Bob's perception of the product's value, so I'm starting high to gauge his interest.
* **Negotiation:**  A high starting point allows for room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving space to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and recognizes the product's value. By rejecting, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, potentially getting closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,400,000. This is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product higher.
* **Closer to my initial offer:** This keeps the potential profit closer to my desired range.
* **Negotiation room:** It still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential earnings and reaching a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. I believe I can still get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is my final attempt to get a better price from Bob. 

* **Moving closer:** It's a further compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's latest offer.
* **Final offer:** I'm showing I'm serious about getting a deal with Bob, but also  that this is my final compromise.
* **Alternative:** If Bob rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John at $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose too much.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while accepting that Bob may not be willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 less than what John is offering.  Given that I've already countered several times, I'm willing to accept this offer.  It's a good compromise that secures a sale and provides a reasonable profit. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
