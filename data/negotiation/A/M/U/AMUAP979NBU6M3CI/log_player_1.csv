Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm confident Bob will be interested since the product is worth $8,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather sell to him than risk further negotiation and potentially lose time and end up selling to John for the same price."
