"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I believe it's worth a lot more, but I'm offering it to you at this price first as a courtesy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is still more than the product is worth to Alice, it's cheaper than buying from John for $150.  As Bob, your goal is to save money, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
