"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be realistic about my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair deal. While $750,000 is closer to a realistic valuation, I can't let it go for less than $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's on the table.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
