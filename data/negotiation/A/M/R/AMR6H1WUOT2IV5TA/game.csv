"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This gives you a great price, and allows me to make a fair profit.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $9,250. This price recognizes your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you.",9000.0,Bob,6,
