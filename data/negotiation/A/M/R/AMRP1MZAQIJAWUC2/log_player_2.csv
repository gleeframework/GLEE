"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $80, and Alice's offer is $15 more than that.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and lower the price. 
* **John is a backup option:** Knowing you can buy from John for $80 gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  I'm starting with a lower price than I'm willing to pay to show I'm serious about negotiating. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer is likely too low for Alice, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  There's still room to increase my offer if needed, and I'm prepared to go up to $80 if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above my maximum of $80.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I have multiple rounds left, so I can continue to try and drive the price down further.
* **John Remains a Safe Option:** I can always buy from John for $80, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm increasing my offer to my maximum price of $80. 
* **Show of Good Faith:** This demonstrates I'm serious about buying but am sticking to my budget.
* **Pressure Point:**  Alice is likely aware of my alternative option with John, so this offer could incentivize her to accept."
