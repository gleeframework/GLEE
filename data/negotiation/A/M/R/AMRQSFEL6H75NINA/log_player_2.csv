"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point, considering the value it brings to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's in my best interest to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $750,000. This is a significant compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?

I can still get a better price than $750,000. I'll try another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $700,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I propose a price of $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?

Alice has made a significant compromise, and while I'd prefer a lower price, $725,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer and ending the negotiation."
