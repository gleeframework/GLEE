"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's still very fair. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better deal from Alice.  You're willing to go up to $120, so there's room for negotiation."
