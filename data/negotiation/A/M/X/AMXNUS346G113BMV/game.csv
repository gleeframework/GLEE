"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair considering your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $13,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,5,
