"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to negotiate while still being attractive enough to potentially close the deal quickly. I've also included a friendly message to create a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to maintain a strong position and try to negotiate higher.  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I have 10 rounds to work with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair considering your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $12,500 is still below my target.  I have several rounds left and John is always an option, so I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $13,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13250}
