"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $10,500 for this valuable item. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer and providing a counter-offer will allow me to potentially secure a better deal without risking too much at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $10,500 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, which might grab her attention. It leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,250. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, I believe there's still room for negotiation. It's still early in the process, and I'm willing to see if she'll budge a bit more before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500.  Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still holding firm on getting a significant discount. It maintains a firm but polite negotiating stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding the product appealing, Bob. I've decided to lower the price to $9,000. This is my final offer, as it closely aligns with your proposed price while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice has come down significantly, and while I didn't reach my target of $8,500,  $9,000 is a solid price that saves me a considerable amount compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
