Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000, giving you a starting point for negotiations.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it slightly below your minimum ($15,000) at $14,000 allows for potential negotiation upwards while still securing a significant profit.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not revealing you have another buyer, there's a subtle implication that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a higher price than his perceived value while still leaving room to accept his counter-offer if needed."
