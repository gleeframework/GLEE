"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is the highest amount I am comfortable spending on this product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,300,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
