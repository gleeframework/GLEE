"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's quality and benefits.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely honest, I have a hard limit at $7,500.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your limit is $7,500, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,100. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
