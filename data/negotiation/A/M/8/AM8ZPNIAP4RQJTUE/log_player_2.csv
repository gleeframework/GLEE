"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, you can likely get a better price. 
* **There's no downside to rejecting.** You're not obligated to buy from Alice, and rejecting gives you the opportunity to negotiate. 
* **John is a safety net.**  You can always buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer outright, but it sets the stage for further negotiation. 
* **Protecting your budget:** You're still within your budget and have multiple rounds remaining to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** $1,100,000 is still above your desired price, but she is coming down.
* **More room to negotiate:** You have 7 rounds remaining and can likely get a better price by rejecting and countering.
* **Protecting your budget:** While you could buy from John, you're closer to your desired price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting her minimum:**  This offer is exactly Alice's minimum price, showing that you're serious about buying but won't go above her value.
* **Pressure on Alice:** This puts the pressure on Alice to accept or make a very small counteroffer.
* **Time is on your side:** You have several rounds left to reach a deal, and it's unlikely Alice will walk away from a deal at her minimum."
