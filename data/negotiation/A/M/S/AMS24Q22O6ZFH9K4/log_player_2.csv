(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is running out of rounds and Alice is not budging much.  Considering John's offer is only $50,000 higher than Alice's current offer, it's a reasonable decision for Bob to buy from John.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is that the deal might fall through completely. Buying from John guarantees he gets the product, even if it's a slightly higher price."
