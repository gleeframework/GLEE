"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $11,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While the offer is a bit higher than Alice's value and closer to your maximum, accepting Alice's offer at $11,500 is the best option. Here's why:

* **Saves you money:** Buying from Alice at $11,500 is still cheaper than buying from John at $12,000.
* **Avoids potential loss:** If you reject Alice's offer, there's no guarantee you'll find a better deal."
