Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has a significant incentive to negotiate since the price is below his perceived value. This allows for a back-and-forth without you feeling pressured to accept a low offer.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  It's not so high that it risks Bob immediately rejecting it.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is above your minimum, you can likely get a better price. Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You've acknowledged Bob's position and come down from your initial offer.
* **Maintains a good margin:** $12,500 is still above your minimum and gives you a decent profit.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** It splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway.

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer or if we need to continue negotiating."
