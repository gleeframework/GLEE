"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better price than $13,500. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he should try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial valuation of $15,000 and also lower than John's price of $15,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
