"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
