Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, leaving Bob with a small perceived gain. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it for the full $12,000 might make Bob feel like he's getting no deal, potentially making him reject the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is already strong, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate further."
