"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I can go down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have budget constraints. I could stretch to $950,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows how serious I am about this.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the value. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point. However, I believe you'd get more out of this product, so I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand your position. While $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to make a significant move. How about $1,025,000?  That's a substantial jump on my end and shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
