Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're already making a profit of $150,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a clear incentive to counteroffer, as he sees the product as worth $1,000,000. 
* **It's not overly aggressive:**  You're not immediately pushing for the maximum possible profit, allowing for a more collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm hoping for a lower price.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still lower than your desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. 
* **Reasoning:** This approach shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a higher profit than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the deal's value for Bob while also highlighting your need for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. However, I'm still hoping to close this deal a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your needs. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than your ideal price, it's higher than what John is offering. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure a sale for $875,000 than to risk further negotiation with Bob or settling for John's offer. 

The potential gains from continued negotiation are outweighed by the certainty of a sale at this price."
