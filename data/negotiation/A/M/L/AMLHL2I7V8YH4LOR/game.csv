"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. However, I'm still hoping to close this deal a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.
