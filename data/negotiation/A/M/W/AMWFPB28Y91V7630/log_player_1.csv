Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the value and anticipated demand, you create a sense of scarcity and desirability, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Option:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, aiming higher with Bob first gives you the chance to maximize your profit. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. You have a strong fallback option with John."
