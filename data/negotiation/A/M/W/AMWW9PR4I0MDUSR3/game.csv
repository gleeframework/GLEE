"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That's a good starting point for us to potentially reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $11,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $11,625.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",11625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up any more ground. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
