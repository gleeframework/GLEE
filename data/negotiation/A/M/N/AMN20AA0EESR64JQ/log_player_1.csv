Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's on offer. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""incredible value"" to justify the high price, even though the exact nature of the product isn't specified. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is positive and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving the door open for counter-offers.

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of either:

1. **Bob accepting the initial high price:**  While unlikely, it's the best-case scenario.
2. **Negotiating a higher price than John's offer:**  Even if Bob counters, Alice has a strong position to negotiate a price significantly above $1,200,000."
