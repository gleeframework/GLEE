This offer starts with a price that's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also frames the message positively, highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your value for it, but given my budget, I am only able to offer $175 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $175 is better than $150, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
