``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob. This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you and would allow me to reach a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you consider $12500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and it's close enough to my initial asking price that I'm willing to accept it. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
