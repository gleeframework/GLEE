"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's limit of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's limit of $8,000. Bob is better off rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate to try and get a lower price. It's still early in the negotiation process and there is room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is moving closer to Bob's ideal price, $10,500 is still above Bob's limit of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a lower price can be reached. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if a deal with Alice cannot be struck."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $10200. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to go lower than $10,200, which is still above Bob's budget.  It's getting late in the negotiation, with only 3 rounds left. Bob has already tried multiple counteroffers, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price.  To avoid the risk of the negotiation falling through, Bob decides to buy the product from John for his budget-friendly price of $8,000."
