"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  There's room for Alice to lower her price, as she values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $13,000.  I understand you value it at $12,000, so this would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,500 is a good compromise. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice could walk away, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a lower price than John, and it's still within Bob's budget."
