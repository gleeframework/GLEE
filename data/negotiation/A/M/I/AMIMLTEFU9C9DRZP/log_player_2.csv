"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards your $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying but need a much better price. 
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important. Even if she rejects this offer, a polite approach keeps the conversation open for a counter-proposal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer puts us in a good position to potentially meet somewhere in the middle, closer to my $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your price, but you can still try to negotiate a bit further. She moved $1,500, so there's a chance to meet in the middle and save a few hundred dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $6,000 is a big jump.  I can do $7,000, which I think is a fair compromise. It's a great product and I'm ready to buy today if you're okay with that price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down to $8,500, and our initial offer was $6,000. Offering $7,000 aims for a near-perfect split of the difference. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding that you're ""ready to buy today"" subtly adds a bit of pressure and might make Alice more inclined to accept to close the deal. 
* **Staying Below Your Limit:** This counteroffer keeps you well below your $8,000 maximum, ensuring you're still getting a good deal even if Alice negotiates a bit higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale today.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting this offer and risking her going higher, or buying from John for the same price.  You've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
