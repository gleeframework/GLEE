"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
