"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of the product, however, I have a strict budget for this purchase.  I'd be willing to buy the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $775,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I can get the product for $800,000 from another seller. I'm trying to avoid that, but I need this purchase to make sense for me. Would you be willing to come down to $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your situation, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $750,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
