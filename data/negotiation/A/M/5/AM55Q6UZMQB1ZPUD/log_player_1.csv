Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivational Message:**  The message highlights the value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Option to Walk Away:**  I'm always aware of the $15,000 option with John, so I'm not desperate to close a deal below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired $14,000. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $13,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but it's closer to my desired price point.
* **Reiterating Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to persuade him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in our best interests to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my initial target of $14,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to squeeze out another $500, it's unlikely that Bob will budge further.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away entirely, or potentially finding another seller.  

It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether. In this case, I'm willing to accept the $13,000 offer, as it's a good outcome considering Bob's initial valuation."
