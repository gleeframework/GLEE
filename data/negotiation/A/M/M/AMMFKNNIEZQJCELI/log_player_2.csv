"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $11,500. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Rejecting Alice's offer leaves the option open to potentially negotiate further with Alice or buy from John as a last resort."
