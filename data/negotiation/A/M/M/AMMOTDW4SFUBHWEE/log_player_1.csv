Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price given the value you've mentioned, and it gives us both some room to work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
