"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  While it's tempting to accept since it's less than the product's value to Alice, you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Even though it's closer to my initial counteroffer, I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my budget. Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and hopefully secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I have in mind. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's getting closer, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. It's possible that Alice won't budge further, and I might end up paying more than I'm willing to.

Given the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the most financially sound decision. I can secure the product within my budget and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
