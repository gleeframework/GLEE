"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate, but I'm also ready to switch to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

I'm going to counter with $85. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. It's still above my minimum threshold, and I believe Bob will be more willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  I believe I can push for a higher price, and I'm not yet in a desperate situation to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}

I'm offering $82.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Bob will accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Bob's offers are starting to fall below my minimum threshold, and I'm worried I'll lose out on a fair price.  I'm going to sell to John for $80 to ensure I get a good return."
