"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $108, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
