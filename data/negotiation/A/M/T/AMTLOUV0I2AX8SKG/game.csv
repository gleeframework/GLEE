"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer. However, I cannot agree to $10,500. I propose a counteroffer of $11,000. This is the highest price I can realistically consider, while still ensuring a fair return for myself. I hope this proposal works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
