Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision soon as there is another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start higher with Bob. 
* **Justification for the price:**  The message hints at the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning another interested party (even if John isn't in a rush) might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer. 
* **Negotiation skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Your absolute floor is $1,200,001 to ensure you make more than selling to John."
