"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we try $95? I feel that's a fair price.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $95 is still quite low for what I'm offering. Could you meet me halfway at $115? That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'd be willing to pay $100.  That's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,6,
