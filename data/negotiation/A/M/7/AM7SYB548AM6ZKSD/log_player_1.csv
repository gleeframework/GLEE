{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I can potentially earn a decent amount ($14,500), while still leaving room for negotiation.  It also shows I'm willing to work with Bob and find a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I'm firm on $14,000.  This still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to counteroffer at $13,500. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's more than what John is offering, and it's not too far from my ideal price. It's time to accept and close the deal."
