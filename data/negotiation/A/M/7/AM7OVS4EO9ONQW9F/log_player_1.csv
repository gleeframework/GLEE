"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a good starting point. It's a strong offer that shows you're serious about selling, but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, this offer is still attractive to him. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,050,000 is still better than selling to John for $1,000,000, it's significantly below the $1,150,000 you offered and below your minimum value of $1,000,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 8 rounds left. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:**  You're lowering your price slightly from $1,150,000, but still keeping it significantly higher than his offer. 
* **Signal commitment:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about making a deal, but still value the product highly. 

This counteroffer gives Bob a better chance of getting a lower price, while still ensuring you get a good deal.  It's a strategic move that keeps the negotiations moving forward."
