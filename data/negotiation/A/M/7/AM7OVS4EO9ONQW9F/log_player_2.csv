"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and this counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. It's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000.  This is a better price than what John is offering, and Bob's goal is to save money.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a price significantly lower than this, so accepting the offer makes sense."
