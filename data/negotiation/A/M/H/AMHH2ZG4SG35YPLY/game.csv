"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My starting price is $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $900,000? This would allow both of us to walk away happy.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our negotiation, but $875,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $890,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a final concession, Alice, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $880,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",880000.0,Bob,6,
