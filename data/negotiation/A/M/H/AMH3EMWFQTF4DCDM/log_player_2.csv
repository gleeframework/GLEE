"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This price gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
