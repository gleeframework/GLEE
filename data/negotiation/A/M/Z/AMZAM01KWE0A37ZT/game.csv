"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to me is $1200000. Based on that, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between the value I see in the product and the price you're asking. Looking forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
