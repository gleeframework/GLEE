"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still leaves room for negotiation before reaching John's $1,200,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,050,000 is too far below my desired price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice's offer is only slightly better than John's price. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Pressure Point:**  By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This might encourage her to come closer to John's price in the next round."
