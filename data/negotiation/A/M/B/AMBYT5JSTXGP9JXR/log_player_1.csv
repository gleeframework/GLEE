"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, but not at the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can potentially secure a better deal.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe bet, but I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still above Bob's current offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. There are more rounds left, and I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can secure a price closer to $1,400,000.  Selling to John now would be settling for a lower profit, and I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to lower my offer incrementally,  showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit closer to my initial target.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and finally agree to a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, and it's getting closer to my initial target. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating and potentially lose a deal altogether.  It's a good time to secure a strong profit and close the deal."
