"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a good price for you considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and do $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $101. This way, we both get a fair deal.",101.0,Alice,5,
