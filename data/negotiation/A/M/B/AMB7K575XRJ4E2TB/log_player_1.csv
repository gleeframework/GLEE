{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be polite and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's worth the investment. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I need to aim for a higher price to maximize my earnings. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer. How about $10,500? This price still gives you a good value, and it's more in line with what I need to make this sale worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and it's better than selling to John. Accepting this offer ensures I make a decent profit, and avoids further negotiations."
