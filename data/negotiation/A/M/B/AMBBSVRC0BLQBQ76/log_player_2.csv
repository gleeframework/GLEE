# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, while still reflecting the product's worth.

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial deal, I must consider the product's true worth. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly cuts into my profit margin but keeps the deal viable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's final offer is still above your budget. While there's a chance you could continue negotiating,  it's likely she won't budge further.  Buying from John is the best choice to stay within your budget and secure the product."
