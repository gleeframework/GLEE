I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is above her valuation ($800,000), it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000, making it the most financially sound decision."
