{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly unique and I believe it holds immense value.  My asking price is $2,000,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Expressing Value:**  Highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value aims to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation flowing. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The $1,500,000 offer from John provides a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Explore Higher Prices:**  By counteroffering, I can potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price of $2,000,000. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** Bob's willingness to counteroffer shows his interest. I want to see how far he's willing to go.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps him engaged and prevents him from feeling like he has the upper hand."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $2,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,750,000? This would allow us both to find a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Value:** I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, indicating I still believe the product is worth more.
* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer presents a middle ground, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not cave to Bob's initial low offer. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  The message emphasizes the ""meet halfway"" aspect to suggest a fair solution for both parties.
* **Continuing the Conversation:**  The message keeps the negotiation open and encourages further dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1750000. Would you be willing to consider $1600000? I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  Bob's continued counteroffers show his genuine interest.  This gives me leverage to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is safe, I believe there's still room to improve the deal with Bob.  I'm willing to take a small risk for a potentially higher reward."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,650,000? It's a small increase from your offer but might make the difference for me to accept. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** The counteroffer is only a small increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm being flexible.
* **Finding Common Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Focus on the Difference:** I highlight the small difference between our positions, hoping to make it easier for Bob to accept.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The question at the end invites Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still trying to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $1600000? I'm not sure I can go any lower than that

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Agreement:** Bob's offer is now only $50,000 below my previous counteroffer. It's likely we're both close to our limits, and further negotiation might be unproductive. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, there's a risk that continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a complete breakdown. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing the negotiation could take time, potentially delaying a sale.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's just above my minimum.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed $100,000, it's not significantly higher than Bob's offer, considering the potential for further negotiation to fail."
