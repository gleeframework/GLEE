"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $160? This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160, which would be $140. Would you be open to that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $140 is closer, but it's still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, at $150.  This is my absolute minimum, but I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to accept that?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from my minimum. I'm willing to make one last concession and accept $147 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know if you're interested.",147.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your last concession, but $147 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $147, which would be $146. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",146.0,Bob,8,
