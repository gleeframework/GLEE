"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product,  which is still a fair price for its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I see your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate it.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a strong price point that I believe reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,450,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product and represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $1,450,000 is closer to what I can afford, I need to stay within my budget. I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
