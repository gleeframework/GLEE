{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still leaving room for you to make a good profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to entice Bob.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I've left a gap between my starting price and Bob's perceived value, allowing for a potential compromise. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response. 

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but based on my assessment, I am only willing to pay $1050000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob.  He's already shown interest and acknowledged the value of the product. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price. This keeps the negotiation open and gives me a better chance of achieving a more favorable outcome.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to maintain leverage and explore better possibilities in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows you to make a profit, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm proposing a middle ground by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates willingness to compromise and makes the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting that this price allows Bob to still make a profit, making the deal more attractive to him.
* **Urgency and Forward Momentum:** I'm emphasizing the importance of moving the negotiation forward to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

By offering a counterproposal that's closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for further discussion, I'm aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I would like to propose a price of $1075000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I want to secure at least $1,000,000 for the product, and this offer doesn't meet that threshold.
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, so I can try to push for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer that might be more enticing for him. This keeps the negotiation in my favor and increases my chances of getting a better price.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue the negotiation and strive for a more favorable outcome."
