"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is way above his budget, and he has a better option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 
While $10,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. He's already established that he's willing to walk away and buy from John, who's offering a price within his budget.  Therefore, Bob should choose to buy from John."
