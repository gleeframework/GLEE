"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,375,000? It's a fair compromise and a great deal for you.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,320,000 is simply not enough for me to make this deal work.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay closer to my last offer.  How about $1,350,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. If we can't agree on this, I may have to consider other offers.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm not willing to go back to $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,335,000?",1335000.0,Bob,8,
