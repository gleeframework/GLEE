Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer hasn't changed since the last round. I've made multiple concessions and it's clear we're not going to reach a deal that meets my minimum price. It's time to move on and accept John's offer, which guarantees me the $1,200,000 I need."
