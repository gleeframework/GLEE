```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $14,000.** This is higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000), but still above your maximum budget ($15,000).
* **John's price is $15,000.** This is your absolute maximum, but it's still a better deal than Alice's offer. 
* **The best strategy is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.** This ensures you get the product at the lowest possible price within your budget."
