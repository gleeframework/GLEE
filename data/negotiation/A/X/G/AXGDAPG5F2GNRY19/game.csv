"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you placed on the product. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
