,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9500 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $7000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $7500. If you can't do that, I might have to look elsewhere.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7500 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $8100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8100 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'll go up to $7800, and I'm hoping we can agree on that. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7800 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7800 and my original offer of $9500. I can offer you the product for $8650. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",8650.0,Alice,7,
