Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $14,000 gives room for negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, but even if he negotiates down, I'm likely to get more than my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my desired minimum price."
