"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This gives me room to negotiate and helps establish a starting point for the bargaining process.  Since John is willing to pay $150, I have a safety net and don't need to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I need to keep trying to get a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired range, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price to $145. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still emphasizes that I believe the product has a higher value. It also gives me a bit more room to compromise in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not comfortable selling for $110, as it's significantly less than the value of the product to me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a value closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not going to give it away. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm getting impatient with the negotiation process.  John is offering a price that is significantly higher and is a safe bet. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
