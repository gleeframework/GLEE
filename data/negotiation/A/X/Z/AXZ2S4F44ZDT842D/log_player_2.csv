"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $110. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$105 is still a good deal for me, and it's likely Alice won't go lower. It's time to secure the deal."
