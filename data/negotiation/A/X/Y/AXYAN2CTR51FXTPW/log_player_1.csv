"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while also showing confidence in my product's worth.  I'm aiming to get as close to $1 million as possible, but I'm also aware of the time limit and John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my goal of $1 million. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $925,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on, while still keeping my profits as high as possible. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I believe there's still room for negotiation. With 6 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000, which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's. It's a fair price that hopefully bridges the gap between us, and I'm confident that Bob will be more likely to accept it. The clock is ticking, and I'm aiming to get a deal done before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting nervous with the dwindling rounds, I'm still not ready to settle for $850,000. I believe there's a chance Bob will come up in his next offer. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering $875,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a higher price. This offer is still above John's offer, and I'm hoping Bob sees the value in closing the deal and avoiding further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time. Bob's latest offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not high enough to justify risking another round. It's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to gamble on a potential counteroffer from Bob that might not be better."
