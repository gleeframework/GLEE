,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  It's a fair price that we can both agree on.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price around $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I'm going to stick to my offer of $11000. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a price of $12250. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my offer of $11000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,8,
