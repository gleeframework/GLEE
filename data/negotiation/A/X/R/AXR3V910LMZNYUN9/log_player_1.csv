"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's worth more than that to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,100,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This price still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to get a more profitable outcome.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth that much to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not high enough.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  It's not ideal, but it's better than risking a continued negotiation with Bob."
