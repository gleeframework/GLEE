# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, saving $350,000."
