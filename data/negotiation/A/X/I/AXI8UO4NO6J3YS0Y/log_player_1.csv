Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, but leaving room for negotiation. Since John is offering $150 as a baseline, I want to see if I can get closer to that $200 mark with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to his value than to mine.  I need to counter in a way that brings him closer to my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and propose a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $175?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

I'm aiming to split the difference between his offer and my initial ask. This keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $145 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, Bob's offer of $145 is close enough to my minimum of $150. It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
