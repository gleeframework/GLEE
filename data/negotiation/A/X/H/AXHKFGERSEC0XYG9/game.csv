"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's truly unique and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business.  My initial offer is $2000000.  Let's see if we can work out a deal that benefits us both.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something we could work with?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's also a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $900000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly unique and I know it will be a great asset for your business.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1050000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm really not comfortable with anything above $900000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,6,
