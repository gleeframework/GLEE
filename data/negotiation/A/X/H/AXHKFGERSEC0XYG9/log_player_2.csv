"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's truly unique and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business.  My initial offer is $2000000.  Let's see if we can work out a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's also a fair compromise. What do you think?
