Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also not immediately selling to John. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's still below my target price, and I have a few more rounds to try and push for a better deal.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However,  $8,750 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,900 is my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8900}
