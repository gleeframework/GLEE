"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However,  $8,750 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,900 is my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I may have to consider other options.",8900.0,Alice,5,
