"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and the offer is now within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer saves Bob $750 compared to buying from John.  It's a reasonable compromise and a good deal for Bob."
