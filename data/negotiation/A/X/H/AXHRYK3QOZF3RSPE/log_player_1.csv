{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room for Bob to counteroffer without making the deal seem unfavorable to him. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price slightly below what you know it's worth to Bob, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.
