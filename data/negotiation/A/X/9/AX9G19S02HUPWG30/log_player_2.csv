"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for that exact price, it makes sense to accept her offer. You're not saving any money, but you're also not losing any money compared to your other option."
