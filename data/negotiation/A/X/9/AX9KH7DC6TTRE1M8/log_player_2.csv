This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $750 less than John's price and $2,750 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Alice is Firm:** She's stated this is her final offer, and further haggling might make her less willing to negotiate.
* **Time is Running Out:**  You're approaching the halfway point of the rounds, and while you might be able to get a slightly better deal, it's not guaranteed, and you risk Alice increasing her price again."
