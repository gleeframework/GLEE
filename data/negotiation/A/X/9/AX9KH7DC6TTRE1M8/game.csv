"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $9,400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit further.  To be honest, I'm finding it hard to justify going above $9,000. If you're willing to meet at that price, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but it's my final offer. I can offer you the product for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",9250.0,Alice,7,
