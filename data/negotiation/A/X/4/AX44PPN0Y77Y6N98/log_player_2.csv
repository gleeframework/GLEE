"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (half the asking price) is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and hopefully prompts her to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth continuing to try and get a lower price, especially since you have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you could keep negotiating, Alice is showing a willingness to come down in price.  At $850,000, you're getting a significant discount from the original price and it's still well within your budget.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a worse deal from John is too high."
