"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $135? It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $132.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",132.5,Alice,5,
