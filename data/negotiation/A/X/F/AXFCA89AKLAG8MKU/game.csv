"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $12,000.  Would you be willing to work with me on that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
