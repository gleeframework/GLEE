"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  While $700,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to stay competitive, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
