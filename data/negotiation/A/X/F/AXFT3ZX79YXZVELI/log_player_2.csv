"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer.  While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting gives him the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer.  He knows Alice's bottom line is $1,000,000, so offering $950,000 is a significant reduction, demonstrating his desire to get a good deal. It also leaves room for Alice to counter, allowing the negotiation to continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his desired range.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows Alice's bottom line is $1,000,000. This counteroffer meets that price, showing a willingness to compromise while still securing a favorable deal. It also increases the likelihood of Alice accepting, as she's essentially getting her desired price."
