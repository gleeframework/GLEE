"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we consider $1,400,000 for the product?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum expectation.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This reflects the value I've placed on the product, while acknowledging your financial constraints.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my budget and the current market conditions, I believe $1,400,000 was already quite generous. I would like to respectfully decline the offer at $1,550,000 and instead propose $1,450,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
