"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes your budget limitations early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches John's price, there's still potential to negotiate a lower price with Alice. We're aiming to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $90.  Would you be willing to consider that?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a potential deal, but it's important to remain firm in our goal to save money. By countering with $90, we signal our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below Alice's and John's offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $95. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and $95 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is still better than John's offer. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of missing out."
