"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  This product will bring you a lot of value, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still looking to keep my spending within my budget. I would like to counter your offer with $875,000.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $875,000 offer is still quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000, which is a very fair offer considering the product's potential.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,5,
