**Reasoning:**

While $885,000 is less than our target price, it's a substantial amount and Bob has been consistently increasing his offers.  Continuing to negotiate may not yield significantly better results and risks alienating Bob. It's best to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the sale entirely."
