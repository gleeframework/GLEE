"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and Alice is asking for $10,000.
* **There are more rounds.**  You have time to negotiate with Alice and see if you can reach a better price. 
* **You have a backup option.**  Knowing you can buy from John for $8,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $8,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
