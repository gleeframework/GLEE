"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,800. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,650?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10650.0,Bob,4,
