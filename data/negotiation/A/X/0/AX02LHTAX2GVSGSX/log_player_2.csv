"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating with Alice.  There's no need to rush into a decision, especially since there's a backup option available with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is trying to get as close to his $10,000 limit as possible. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, showing willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product while also stating a clear price point.  This helps to keep the negotiation focused and positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not ready to go down to $10,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his goal, there's still room for negotiation.  He can try to push for a lower price in the next round.  Additionally, the option to buy from John for $10,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,800. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,650?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering to split the difference between the current price and Bob's desired price shows a willingness to compromise and move closer to an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Interest:** The message reiterates Bob's strong interest in the product, which could make Alice more likely to consider his counteroffer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both parties, reinforcing the idea of a win-win outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $10,650. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer the product to you for $10,700. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice's offer of $10,700 is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still a $700 gap. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and hasn't reached his maximum budget yet. 
* **Leveraging the Backup Option:**  The option to buy from John for $10,000 provides a safety net, giving Bob the leverage to continue negotiating with Alice without feeling pressured to accept an offer that's still higher than his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm still aiming for $10,000, but I'm willing to go to $10,700 as a final offer.  This is my absolute limit, and I'm really hopeful we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is explicitly stating that this is his final offer, signaling to Alice that further negotiation will be difficult. This creates pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Emphasizing the Target:**  Reiterating Bob's desire for $10,000 keeps that figure in mind and implies that accepting this offer is a good deal for both parties.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and cooperative tone, making it less likely that Alice will walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10,700. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer the product to you for $10,900. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Alice's offer of $10,900 is only $100 lower than her previous offer.  This indicates that she is unwilling to budge further, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.
* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob has already stated his absolute limit of $10,700. Going any higher would compromise his goal of saving as much money as possible.
* **The Backup Plan:** With John's offer of $10,000, Bob has a guaranteed way to acquire the product at a price that aligns with his budget.  It's more advantageous to accept John's offer and avoid further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiations."
