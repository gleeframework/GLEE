"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to keep the price lower, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I need to be mindful of my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
