{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You only have one round left, and Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.  While you could make another counteroffer, there's a good chance she'll reject it, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price than what you'd like.  

It's best to cut your losses and purchase from John.  This will save you time and effort, and you'll still get the product you want, even if it's not at your absolute target price."
