"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately, it's above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
