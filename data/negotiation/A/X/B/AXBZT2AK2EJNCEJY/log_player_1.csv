"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good price from Bob.  I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum value of $150.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and close the deal before I need to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. I'll counter again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm dropping my price further, hoping to entice Bob to accept.  I'm still above my minimum value of $150, but I want to see if this offer is closer to Bob's range and if it's enough to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's taking a long time. There's a chance he might keep offering increasingly higher prices, but I'm not sure how many more rounds I can afford to wait.  John is offering a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
