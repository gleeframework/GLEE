Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below the value he places on the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, and for me to potentially accept a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  This price gives me a good middle ground while still ensuring I can sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's clearly interested in the product. This means there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, giving me a strong negotiating position. 

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, knowing I have a safe option with John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I am rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** $12,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Moving Towards Goal:** This counteroffer moves me closer to my desired price point while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I am keeping the option to sell to John open, maintaining my leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $12,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $12,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Good Deal for Bob:** It's also a fair price for Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $12,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob might back out or offer a lower price.
* **Profitable Outcome:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of losing a deal altogether. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action given the current situation."
