"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $750,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I can offer you the product for $725,000. This is my final concession, so I hope this is more in line with what you're looking for.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000, Bob. Your offer of $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to stand firm on this price. If you're willing to meet me at $725,000, I'd be happy to sell it to you.",725000.0,Alice,7,
