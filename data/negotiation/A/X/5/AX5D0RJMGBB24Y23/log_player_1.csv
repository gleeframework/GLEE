"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $85. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $170 represents fair value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you do $140? I'm trying to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere around $100?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm seeing your point, but $100 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to go down to $125, but that's my absolute best offer.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm really trying to make this work, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  If you could do it for $110, I can close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.
