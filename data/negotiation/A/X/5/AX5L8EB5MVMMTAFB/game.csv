"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my research on similar products, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.  This offer stands for 24 hours.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering my research and the value I place on this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly, as I'm running out of time.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
