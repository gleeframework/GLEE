"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially negotiate a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price to something closer to Bob's desired range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $10,000 is still higher than Bob's budget, but it is a good sign that she is willing to negotiate. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down even further. If he rejects this offer, he can counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway. There's still a chance that he can get a better deal than $10,000."
