"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,000?  It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $11,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Alice,5,
