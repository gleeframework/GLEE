While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should counter-offer again, trying to get closer to his limit."

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than his budget. John is offering a price within his budget and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer in the future."
