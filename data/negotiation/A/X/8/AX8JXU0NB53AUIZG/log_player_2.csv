"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While you could buy it from John for $12,000, Alice's offer of $11,500 saves you $500. It makes sense to accept her offer."
