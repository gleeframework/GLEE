Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, offering it to Bob first at $10,000 allows me to potentially earn a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price of $10,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but the ""limited-time offer"" and mention of another buyer creates a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion, which might encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still room to negotiate down towards his perceived value while staying above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
