Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $100 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $100. Even though it's my minimum, I can still try to negotiate.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Even though it's only a little more than my minimum, it's still better than selling to John.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and getting stuck with the minimum price."
