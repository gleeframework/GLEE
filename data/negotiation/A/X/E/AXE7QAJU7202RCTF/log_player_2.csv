"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, but still within the range where both parties could potentially benefit. This sets the stage for negotiation and signals that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  The price is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but not so low that it's immediately insulting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still worth trying to push for a lower price.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility.  There's likely still room for a deal closer to Bob's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below his maximum. This counteroffer is a good middle ground and could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is very close to Bob's maximum, and the deal is likely to be made with a little more negotiation.  However, with only 5 rounds left, it's risky to continue pushing.  The opportunity cost of rejecting this offer is high, as there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob may have to settle for a higher price with John.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
