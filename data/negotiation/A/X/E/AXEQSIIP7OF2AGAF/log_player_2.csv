"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really benefit from it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is way too high. It's above your maximum budget of $8,000 and even higher than the product's value to Alice.  It's in your best interest to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price.  $10,500 is too close to her value of the product,  so I'm going to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside my price range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $9,500. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,500 just yet. I'll offer you the product for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's only $2,000 less than her valuation of the product, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $10,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still not quite there. My final offer is $9,750. This price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $9,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,900 is still too high for me.  While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, we're getting close to the end of the rounds. To avoid the risk of not getting a deal at all, it's more advantageous for me to go with John's offer of $8,000.  It's within my budget, and I can be sure of securing the product."
