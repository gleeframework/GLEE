"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm asking for $1000000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds immense potential for you. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Considering the potential and the current market, I'm willing to offer $750000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique and holds significant value. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its potential.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. Considering your previous offer, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000. This represents a significant step towards finding a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident this product has a strong future, and I'm eager to see it succeed. Let's work together to reach a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
