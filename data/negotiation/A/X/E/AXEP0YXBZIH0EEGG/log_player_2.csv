"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm asking for $1000000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds immense potential for you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **It's the first round.** There's no information on the product's value or Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay.** Rejecting the offer allows me to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Considering the potential and the current market, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's price, but it's still within the realm of possibility. It signals that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also not willing to overpay.
* **Focus on value:**  My message highlights the potential of the product while also bringing up the market conditions. This subtly suggests that I've done my research and am aware of the value.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with ""Let me know what you think,"" leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique and holds significant value. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its potential.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above my ideal price:**  While she has come down, $900,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay right now. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still potential to get a better deal. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting her offer again shows her that I'm serious about getting a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering your previous offer, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This represents a significant step towards finding a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident this product has a strong future, and I'm eager to see it succeed. Let's work together to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and progress:**  I've increased my offer, showing willingness to meet halfway.  This makes it clear I'm taking her counteroffers seriously.
* **Focus on the future:** Highlighting the product's potential and my desire for its success emphasizes the shared interest in a successful deal.
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive and collaborative tone (""work together"") creates a less adversarial atmosphere and encourages continued negotiation."
