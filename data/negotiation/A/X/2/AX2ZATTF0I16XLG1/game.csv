"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
