"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's discuss the price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for it, reflecting the value I see in it and the need to keep it within my financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that balances your budget constraints with the value the product holds for me. Let's aim for $825,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe you'll find it reasonable as well.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value this product, $825,000 is still slightly over my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to offer $775,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to stretch a bit further, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $795,000. This price still allows me to cover my costs, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $795,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. Let's aim for $780,000.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $787,500. This price is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target as possible. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,7,
