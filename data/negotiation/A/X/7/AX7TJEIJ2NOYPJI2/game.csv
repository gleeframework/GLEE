"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my research, I believe a fair price is closer to $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to meet you closer to your number. How about we settle on $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000. If we can't reach an agreement at that point, I'll have to explore other options.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
