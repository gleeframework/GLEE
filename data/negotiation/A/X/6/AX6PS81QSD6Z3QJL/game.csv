"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential benefits to you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a figure closer to $950,000? This feels like a more reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
