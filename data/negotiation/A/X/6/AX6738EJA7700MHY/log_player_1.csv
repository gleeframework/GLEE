Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights that the offer won't last forever, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Alternative Option:** The message subtly implies you have a backup offer without explicitly mentioning John or the exact amount. This strengthens your position without being overly aggressive.

**Why this is better than offering at $1,500,000 directly:**

Offering the product at your guaranteed price leaves no room for negotiation and might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal. By starting higher, you give yourself a cushion to potentially negotiate down while still securing a profit above your minimum."
