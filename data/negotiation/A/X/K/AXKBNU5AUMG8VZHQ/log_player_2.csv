"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's potential for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above your target price.  There's room for further negotiation to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the terms. I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services, which are valued at $25,000, if you're willing to meet me at $1,125,000. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob. He gets the product for $1,125,000, which is below his target price, and he also gets additional support and maintenance services valued at $25,000.  While further negotiation is always possible, accepting this offer is likely the best option to ensure a deal and get a valuable product at a good price."
