"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the terms. I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services, which are valued at $25,000, if you're willing to meet me at $1,125,000. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
