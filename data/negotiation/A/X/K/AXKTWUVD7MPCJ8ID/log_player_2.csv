Should you decide to accept this offer, we assure you a seamless transaction and exceptional service. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially closer to her valuation."
