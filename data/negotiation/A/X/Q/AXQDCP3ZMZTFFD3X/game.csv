"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $170 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $150.  This is my final offer.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $150 is still too far from what I'm willing to spend.  I could go up to $90, but that's my absolute limit.",90.0,Bob,4,
