Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer is below Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to compromise:**  You're not starting with a ridiculously high price, showing good faith in the negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, you can decide whether to counteroffer, accept his counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
