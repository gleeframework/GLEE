"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and exclusivity, subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting high, I anchor the negotiation in my favor and gauge Bob's willingness to pay. His response will inform my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates he's willing to pay a premium, suggesting he might go higher. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I know the product's value and am willing to negotiate for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 undervalues the true worth of this product.  It offers significant and unique benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (But Not Too Much):** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by moving significantly closer to Bob's offer. However, the counter-offer is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message reinforces the product's inherent value, subtly reminding Bob why he's interested in the first place.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  By proposing a price exactly in the middle, I'm aiming for a win-win solution that feels fair to both parties.  This can encourage Bob to accept or make a more reasonable counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about the product's benefits, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and willing to move towards a mutually agreeable price. $975,000 is a strong offer and a significant profit above my minimum. While I might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.  It's best to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the sale."
