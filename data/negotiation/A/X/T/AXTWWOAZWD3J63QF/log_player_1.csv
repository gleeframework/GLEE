"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm also framing it as a great deal to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than $150. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's still a great deal, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $150.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price again, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer the product for $145.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. Can you consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to meet my minimum, and I'm getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's better to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
