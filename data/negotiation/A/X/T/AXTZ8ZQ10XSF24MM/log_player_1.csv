Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($300,000) between your minimum and Bob's valuation.

This strategy:

1. **Leaves room for negotiation:** While ambitious, the offer isn't absurdly high, allowing for potential counter-offers from Bob.
2. **Provides a strong starting point:** Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to secure a price significantly higher than your guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.

It's important to remember that negotiation is a fluid process.  Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
