Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's also significantly lower than your minimum price, leaving you room to compromise. It also frames the offer as a great deal, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $90. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I can still try to get closer to my goal of $120.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident you'll still find this a good value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too far below my minimum price of $120. I'm not willing to go lower than that.  John is willing to pay my full price, so I'll sell to him."
