"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $10000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
