Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $17,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good strategy to start with a higher price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, we can always lower the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm rejecting it and will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still trying to get a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm rejecting the offer and will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

``` 

I'm offering $15,500. This is a further compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's a fair price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I believe this could be a final offer that Bob might accept."
