Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum value. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves me with a profit.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum value.  I'm confident that I can get a better price from John.  It's time to move on and sell to him for $15,000."
