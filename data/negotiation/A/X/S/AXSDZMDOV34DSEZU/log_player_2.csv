Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $910,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product at $920,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated Alice down to $920,000, a saving of $80,000 from her initial offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** You're over halfway through the negotiation rounds.  While you might be able to get the price down a bit more, there's no guarantee.
* **John's Price:**  Getting Alice much closer to John's price ($1,000,000) is unlikely, and the potential savings might not outweigh the risk of her walking away."
