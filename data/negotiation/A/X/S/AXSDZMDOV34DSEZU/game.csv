"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up this opportunity.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That would be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $900,000, which would be $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm still interested, but I have to stick to my budget. How about $910,000? That's a reasonable move on my end.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $910,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product at $920,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",920000.0,Alice,7,
