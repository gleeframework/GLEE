"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob thinking about the product's worth.
* **Reasoning for the price:**  I provide a brief justification for the price, making it seem more reasonable and not just an arbitrary number. 
* **Open ended question:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate higher and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a good option, but I want to explore if I can get closer to that value with Bob. 
* **Building leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and justification:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still firmly above his initial price. The message emphasizes the value of the product and the fairness of the new price.
* **Specific number and rationale:**  By offering a specific price ($10,500) and providing a reason for it (splitting the difference), I make the offer more concrete and less open to further negotiation. 
* **Keeping leverage:**  While I'm coming down, the price is still well above Bob's offer, and I'm maintaining my leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While $9,500 is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of the negotiation. 
* **Potential for better outcome:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I still have room to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer:** While selling to John for $15,000 is still a good option, I haven't reached a point where I feel the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage and might encourage him to come up with a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. I can't go as low as $9,500, but I'm prepared to meet you halfway again.  How about we settle on $10,000?  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my previous offer, but still staying above Bob's most recent offer.
* **Clear Signal:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to make a final concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Middle Ground:** The offer of $10,000 is a clear middle ground, aiming for a swift resolution. 
* **Emphasize Benefit:** I remind Bob that this would still be a good deal for him, even with a slight increase from his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're now at round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Small gains:**  Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his previous one, and the potential gains from further negotiation are becoming minimal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially not reaching a deal outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. 
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a significantly higher profit and reduces the risk of losing the deal altogether.

With limited rounds remaining and the potential for a stalemate, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
