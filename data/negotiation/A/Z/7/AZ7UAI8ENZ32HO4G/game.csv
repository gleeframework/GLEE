"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. I can't go as low as $9,500, but I'm prepared to meet you halfway again.  How about we settle on $10,000?  This would still be a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
