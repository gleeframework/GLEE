"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little too high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $725,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000? I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value here and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to make this deal happen. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
