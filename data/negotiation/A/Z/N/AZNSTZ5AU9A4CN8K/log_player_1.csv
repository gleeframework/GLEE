Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $13,000 gives me a good starting point while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value to Bob:**  I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so $13,000 is a reasonable price for him to consider.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John gives me the flexibility to walk away from a deal that isn't profitable."
