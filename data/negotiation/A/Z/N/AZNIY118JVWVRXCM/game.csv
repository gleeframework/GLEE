"Alice, that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to offer $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still very far apart on price. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is not feasible for me.  I can go up to $650,000, but that's my limit for this round.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. However, we need to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product. It's not just about the purchase price; it's about the significant returns and opportunities it offers.  To that end, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair and realistic offer, given the potential this product holds for your business.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product represents a significant opportunity, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the same price I can get it for elsewhere.",800000.0,Bob,6,
