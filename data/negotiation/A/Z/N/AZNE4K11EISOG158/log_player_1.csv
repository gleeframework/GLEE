Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I think this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable amount ($800,000). 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning that you believe the product would be ""highly valuable"" to Bob subtly reinforces the value proposition.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""proposing a price"" instead of  ""my final price,"" you signal a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy balances ambition with flexibility, aiming to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential counter-offers."
