Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. But I really need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet at $82.50? That's as low as I'm willing to go.

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point and while I could try to haggle further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $82.50 gets me the product at a reasonable discount."
