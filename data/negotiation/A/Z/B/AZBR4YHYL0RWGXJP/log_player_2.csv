"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to work with you,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is fair to both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 1300000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob can continue negotiating to try and get a better deal, and still has the option of buying from John at any point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 1275000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for 1290000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still higher than Bob's target of $1,200,000. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob is willing to continue if it means getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While your offer is getting closer, $1,290,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 one last time. This is a very fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1250000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for 1280000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, she is still $80,000 above Bob's ideal price.  At this point, Bob has two options:

* **Continue negotiating:** There's a chance Alice might lower the price further, but it's becoming increasingly unlikely.
* **Buy from John:**  John is offering the product for Bob's target price of $1,200,000.  This is the best deal available to Bob at this point, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice. 

Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the most logical choice."
