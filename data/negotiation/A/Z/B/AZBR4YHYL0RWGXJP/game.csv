"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to work with you,  $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this time. I'm willing to pay $1250000. This price is fair to both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
