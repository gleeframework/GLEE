"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $100 to me. I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Would you like to purchase it for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $100, he can definitely do better than $85. It's worth exploring if he can get a lower price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $75. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to establish a strong negotiating position.
* **Justifying the Offer:** He provides a reason for his counteroffer, emphasizing his budget constraints. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $75 is still a reasonable price, leaving room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Considering the value of the product and aiming to find a fair compromise, how about we meet in the middle at $80 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Price:** $80 is still within Bob's budget and represents a reasonable compromise, considering Alice's initial price.
