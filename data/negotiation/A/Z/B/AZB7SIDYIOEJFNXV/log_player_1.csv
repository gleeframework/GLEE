I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a starting point that is slightly above my minimum threshold, leaving room for negotiation if necessary.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept anything below my minimum threshold. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise."
