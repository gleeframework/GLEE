"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's mutually beneficial. I want to see how Bob reacts and gauge his interest level before making any further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with the $1,200,000 offer, I still believe the product is worth more. I want to see if I can leverage my position and get closer to my initial price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit. I believe Bob will see the value in this price, and we can finalize the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is too low. I'm not willing to go that far down in price, and I'm worried that further negotiations will only lead to a lower offer.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing that deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
