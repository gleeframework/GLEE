Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for discussion, encouraging Bob to respond with either an acceptance or a counteroffer."
