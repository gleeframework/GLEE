# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.

Alice is very slowly coming down in price, and we're running out of rounds.  It's unlikely she'll go below $12,000 at this rate. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price."
