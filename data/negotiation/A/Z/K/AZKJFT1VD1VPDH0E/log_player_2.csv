"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a competitive price. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price. You're already saving $50,000, but there's potential for more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a good deal for you.  You're saving $75,000 compared to John's price, and while you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  Accepting her offer is the most sensible choice."
