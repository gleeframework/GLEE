"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come to an agreement that works for both of us. I propose we set the price at $90 for the product. This still reflects its value to me, while staying close to your proposed price.",90.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I've decided to accept your compromise and propose a price of $85. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, while also allowing us to reach an agreement. I hope this works for you.",85.0,Alice,7,
