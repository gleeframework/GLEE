Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product ($12,000). This gives me some room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room:**  The price is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This allows for some potential negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum profit.
* **Friendly Approach:**  The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer. If it's close to my desired price, I might accept. If it's too low, I'll counteroffer again. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John for $15,000, guaranteeing my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  His offer of $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and also below my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Potential for a counteroffer:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll carefully consider how much I'm willing to lower my price to avoid losing the deal with Bob. 
* If Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer, I can still choose to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring a better outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still some room to negotiate if Bob makes another counteroffer, but the price is closer to my desired outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price for the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide if I'm willing to negotiate further or if I should sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $11,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000, it's significantly closer than Bob's previous offer of $10,500.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away or potentially lowering his offer further. 
* **Time is Money:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and move on to other opportunities. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures a decent profit while avoiding further negotiation and potential delays."
