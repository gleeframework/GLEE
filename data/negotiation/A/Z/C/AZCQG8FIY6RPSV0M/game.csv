"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,050,000 is certainly tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I'm confident this reflects a fair deal considering its unique benefits. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire for a higher price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we discuss any other benefits or concessions you can offer to sweeten the deal?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
