"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
