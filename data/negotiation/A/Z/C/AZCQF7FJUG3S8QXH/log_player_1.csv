Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal you won't want to miss!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's inclined, increasing your potential earnings. 
* **Secure the Sale:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value makes it more likely he'll accept, securing a higher profit than selling to John for $100."
