"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal you won't want to miss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $119 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy it from John and save a dollar."
