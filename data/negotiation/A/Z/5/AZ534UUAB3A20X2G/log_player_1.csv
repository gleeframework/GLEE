Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves some room for me to potentially lower it if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, but I'm not mentioning him to Bob at this point.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1350000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a higher price from Bob.
* **John as a Guarantee:**  I have the safety net of John's offer, so I can afford to be a bit more firm in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  My counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him to justify the price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  My counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **John as Backup:**  John's offer provides a safety net in case Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer. 

This counteroffer strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while also moving closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I can't agree to $1450000. I would like to propose $1400000 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Success:**  We have successfully negotiated a price that is close to my desired range.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially drag out the process and increase the risk of Bob backing out or finding another seller.
* **John as Backup:**  While John's offer is still an option, I'm confident that this deal with Bob is very close to what I want.

**Conclusion:** Given the proximity of Bob's offer to my target price and the time and risk factors involved, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer."
