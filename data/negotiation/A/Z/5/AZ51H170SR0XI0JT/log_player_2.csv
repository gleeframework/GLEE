"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's very reasonable, considering its worth. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $10,000.** This is within your budget, but you can do better.
* **John's price is $12,000.** This is your fallback option.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate further, potentially getting a lower price.  Even if you end up buying from John, you haven't committed to Alice's price yet."
