"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price.  We have plenty of rounds to try and get closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** While we want to save money, offering something ridiculously low (like $10) might offend Alice and make her less likely to negotiate. $80 is a low but not insulting counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $120 is better than her initial offer, it's still above our $100 budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, so there's a chance we can get the price down further.
* **John as Backup:** We always have the option to go with John if the negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle on $95? That's a fair offer that gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between Alice's offer ($120) and our previous counteroffer ($80). 
* **Below Budget, Above Halfway:** Our offer of $95 is still below our $100 budget but above the halfway point of Alice's initial offer. This shows we're willing to compromise but also holding firm to a reasonable price. 
* **Positive Language:** We're using positive language (""fair offer,"" ""closer to a deal"") to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the profit I need. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not There:** $110 is getting very close to our budget, but it's still above it. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Alice is indicating this is her lowest price, but we haven't reached our limit in counter-offers yet. It's worth seeing if she'll budge a little more. 
* **John Option Remains:**  We can still go with John for $100 if needed, so there's minimal risk in pushing Alice slightly further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. You've got a great product, and I'm willing to make this work. How about we split the difference and call it $105? That's me stretching my budget, but I'm serious about buying this from you."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're showing Alice we're willing to compromise by going above our $100 budget, but only slightly. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $105, we're splitting the difference between her last offer ($110) and our previous counteroffer ($100). This is often seen as a fair negotiation tactic.
* **Conveying Seriousness:** We're reiterating our strong interest in the product to encourage Alice to make the deal. 
* **Time Constraint:** We only have a few rounds left, so it's becoming riskier to continue lowballing. This offer keeps us in the game while still aiming for a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. I can do $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is sticking to a price that's too high for our budget. It's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Better Alternative:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is within our budget and saves us money compared to Alice's final offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're running out of rounds, and further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a significant price drop. It's time to take the safe option and secure the product at a good price from John."
