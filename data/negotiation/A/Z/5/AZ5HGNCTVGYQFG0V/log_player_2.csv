"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.**  You want to save as much as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.**  This gives you more control over the negotiation and the potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower starting point:**  You're starting at a lower price than Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable decrease:** A $10 decrease is a significant step, but not too aggressive, giving Alice room to potentially counter.
* **Clear message:**  You're stating your interest and the reason for your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 135? It's a great price for a fantastic product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** At $135, you're saving $15 compared to buying from John.
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and meet you halfway. 
* **Time efficiency:** Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but it risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
