{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I know it would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000,  which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950000?  This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with that offer. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 simply isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $975000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $960000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $960,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob and the limited rounds left in our negotiation."
