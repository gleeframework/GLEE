Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. It's a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Highlighting Value:**  My message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider its worth.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I use the word ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message implies that I am open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The actual price and negotiation strategy will depend on your specific product and your assessment of Bob's potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my initial price of $15,000, but still above my minimum of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Settling:**  While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial asking. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $13,000 or $14,000. I'll emphasize the unique value of the product and reiterate my openness to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value your offer, $12,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This price still allows you to secure a valuable asset while acknowledging its unique features and potential."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique features and potential benefits, subtly reinforcing its worth. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm using the phrase ""meet in the middle"" to emphasize that the offer is fair and a reasonable compromise.
* **Direct Communication:** I'm being clear and direct with my counteroffer, leaving no room for ambiguity.

**Important Note:** The specific price in the counteroffer can be adjusted based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your perceived value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. Would you be willing to consider $12500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my desired price range. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob could become less interested or that we could get stuck in a protracted back-and-forth. 
* **Time Factor:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's significantly less than what I can get from Bob.
* **Compromise:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows for a compromise, and it's a good deal considering my minimum asking price of $10,000.

**Decision:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer,  as it's a good deal for me while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
