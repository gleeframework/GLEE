Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. This strengthens my negotiating position.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. If Bob outright rejects the offer or counters with a much lower price, I'm prepared to negotiate down towards the $1,200,000 mark, ensuring I still make a profit."
