Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly higher than your offer, but still reasonable considering the product's value. I'm willing to sell it to you for 1200000. What do you think?

Alice's counteroffer is at Bob's maximum budget. It's a good deal considering Bob could also buy the product from John for the same price."
