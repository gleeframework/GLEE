"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to make a solid profit and still gives you a significant savings compared to the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This still provides a significant benefit to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
