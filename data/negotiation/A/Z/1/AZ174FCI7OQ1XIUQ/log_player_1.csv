{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the benefits to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer is a good starting point and allows for potential counteroffers from Bob. I can always adjust my price depending on his response.
* **The Backup Plan:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested. There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **The Backup Plan:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's offer. 

I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm countering Bob's offer, showing that I'm still open to negotiating.
* **Bridging the Gap:** $11,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating that I am not desperate to sell.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the opportunity to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still a chance to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a suboptimal offer.

I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. While $10,500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a little more to make this deal work for me.  How about $10,750? It's a small difference, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:**  I'm proposing a small increase to $10,750, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Focus on Closing:** My message emphasizes closing the deal, suggesting that this might be my final offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** $10,750 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, indicating that I am not desperate to sell.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, as I mentioned before, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm at $10,500, and I'm not willing to go below $10,750.  We've reached an impasse.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take a lot of time and might not lead to a better price.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me the maximum value for the product. It's a risk-free option.

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most logical and financially advantageous decision."
