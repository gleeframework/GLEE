{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. Although it's closer, I'm not willing to pay that much. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is not going to budge much further. It's better to secure the product from John for a guaranteed price of $80, which is within my budget and avoids further haggling."
