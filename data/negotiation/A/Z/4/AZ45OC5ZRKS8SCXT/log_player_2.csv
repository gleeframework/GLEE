"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $950,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is still below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer and it's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate if you are unwilling to pay more than John's price."
