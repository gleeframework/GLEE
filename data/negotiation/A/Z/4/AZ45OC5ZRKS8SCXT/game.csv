"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we start the conversation at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is still below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
