"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. This is my final offer, as I can get it for that price elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable enough to justify the price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
