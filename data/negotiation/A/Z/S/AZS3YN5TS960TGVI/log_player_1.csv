"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value is $150. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160. This is another compromise, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John.  While I'd prefer to get more than $150, Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm concerned I'm wasting time. It's better to sell to John and guarantee a sale at a price above my minimum."
