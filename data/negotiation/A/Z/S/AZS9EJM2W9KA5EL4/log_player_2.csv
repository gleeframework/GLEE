Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $900,000, which is a 25% discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $700,000 is still not as high as I'd like to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I can offer you $800,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has met your ideal price point. There's no benefit to haggling further or going with John, as you'll get the same price."
