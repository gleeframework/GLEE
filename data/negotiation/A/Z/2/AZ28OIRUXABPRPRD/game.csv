"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some profit on your end. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while still being within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,080,000. This is a final compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
