"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still looking to spend closer to $85.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a price we both agree on. I appreciate that.  How about we meet in the middle at $92?  I'm willing to come down from $95, and this price still reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
