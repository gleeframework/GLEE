Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. How about $1,050,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob.  It's possible he'll come up a bit more, and I want to see if that's the case."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired outcome."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $1,060,000 as a compromise. This still allows you to achieve a good return on your investment, while keeping the cost reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob.  While $1,060,000 is tempting, it's still a significant discount from my ideal price. There are still rounds left, and I'm hoping I can get closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,075,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,065,000?  It's a fair compromise, and allows us both to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, how about we settle for $1,062,500? This brings us closer to your desired price while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to $1,100,000, it's getting late in the game.  $1,062,500 is a decent price, and it's likely that Bob won't budge much further.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
