"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
