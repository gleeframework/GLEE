"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,150,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we settle at $1,200,000?  This price reflects the product's value and would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
