"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is within his budget, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to strike a deal within his budget while still leaving some room for negotiation.  He is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's serious interest in buying the product but also his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob the opportunity to potentially secure a lower price.  He still has 7 rounds left, and the time pressure isn't yet too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to meet halfway. This counteroffer is still within his budget and not too far from Alice's latest offer, suggesting he is serious about buying the product while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to $1,090,000, which is only $90,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob time and ensures he gets the product within his budget.  While there's a chance he could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price in the future, there's also the risk of Alice rejecting further offers, making it potentially harder to close the deal."
