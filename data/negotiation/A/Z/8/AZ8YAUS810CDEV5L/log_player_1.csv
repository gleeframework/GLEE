"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a good starting point and allows me to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I believe this shows willingness to compromise while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for too low a price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is a bit closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left and there's potential for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm also keeping it above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal but also that I'm not desperate."
