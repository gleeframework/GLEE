"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I am confident I can get a better price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can we work together to find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,300,000, so I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,250,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to compromise a little further and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll receive.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000, which is as close to my budget as I can get. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I could keep negotiating, I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is the most profitable option at this point."
