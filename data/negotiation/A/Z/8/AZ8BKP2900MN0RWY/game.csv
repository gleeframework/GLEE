"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can we work together to find a mutually beneficial price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,250,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to compromise a little further and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll receive.  Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000, which is as close to my budget as I can get. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
