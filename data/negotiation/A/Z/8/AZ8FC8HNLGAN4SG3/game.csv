"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a more competitive price point.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the value this product brings.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candor and your willingness to meet me closer to my price point.  However, I do feel that $1,100,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
