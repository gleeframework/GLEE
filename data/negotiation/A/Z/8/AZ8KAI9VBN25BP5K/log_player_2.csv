"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its high value and unique features, it's worth $15,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to secure this item at a significant discount. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is overpriced:** While Alice claims the product is worth $15,000 to you, you've already established your maximum price is $15,000. Her starting point is likely inflated.
* **Room for negotiation:**  By rejecting the offer, you signal that the price is too high and open the door for Alice to potentially make a better offer closer to her actual value of $10,000.
* **Backup option:** You have John as a backup, ensuring you can still buy the product if negotiations with Alice fail.

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you encourage Alice to offer a more competitive price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
