Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you recognize its immense value, and I believe a price of $1,450,000 reflects that.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your own valuation and John's offer), you have leverage to start high. 
* **Strategic markup:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 gives you significant room for negotiation while still aiming for a price substantially above your minimum.
* **Confident but open:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and inviting Bob to engage in discussion. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, you don't know his financial limitations or how important the product is to him relative to other potential purchases.
* **Negotiation skills:**  Be prepared to justify your price and potentially negotiate if Bob pushes back. However, remember your fallback option (John) gives you a strong position."
