"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1800000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1800000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, though - I'll include a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support for the product. Can you consider meeting me at $1700000?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1700000. Can you consider $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I can do $1650000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",1650000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1620000 for the product, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept my offer?",1620000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1620000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $1680000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you think about it?",1680000.0,Alice,9,
