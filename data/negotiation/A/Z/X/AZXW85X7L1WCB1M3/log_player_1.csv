Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer without being too aggressive. 

This strategy allows for the following:

* **Potential for profit:** If Bob accepts, you'll make a profit of $4,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can see if he'll counteroffer closer to your desired price.
* **Safety net:** You can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price, it's still better than selling to John for $15,000.  You have room to negotiate.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I've counter-offered at $10,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value of the product while suggesting a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $10,000, I'm aiming to find a middle ground between our initial positions. This could lead to a successful negotiation where we both end up with a satisfactory deal. If Bob rejects, I can continue to negotiate, but I'm always aware of the option to sell to John for $15,000."
