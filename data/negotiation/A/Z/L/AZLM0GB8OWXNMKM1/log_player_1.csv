Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product. 

**Strategy:**

* By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming to make the initial offer appealing. 
*  If Bob rejects, I'll have the opportunity to gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly.
*  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, giving me flexibility to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I have a better opportunity with John, who is willing to pay my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point, hoping to find a middle ground.  If Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I will consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500?  This would still be a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $10,500. This is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than what I would get from John.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be  reasonable and show a willingness to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the value Bob would still get at this price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us. 
* I'm also testing the waters to see how far Bob is willing to go. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely move closer to my desired price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer than his previous offers, it's not worth risking the potential loss.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price, so it makes more sense to sell to John.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John because:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer guarantees me my desired profit.
* **Time Savings:**  Negotiating with Bob has taken time, and continuing to bargain with him is uncertain. 
* **Higher Value:** John's offer is significantly higher than anything Bob has offered. 

Selling to John minimizes risk and ensures a favorable outcome."
