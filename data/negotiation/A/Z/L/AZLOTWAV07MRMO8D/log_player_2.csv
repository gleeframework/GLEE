"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I think $170 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to stay well below her last offer and closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $130. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting close to my limit, but I'm still willing to see if I can get it for $120 or very close to it.  It's worth one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're really close.  $130 is just a bit more than I can do. How about we split the difference and call it $125?  That's my final offer."",
 ""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Firm but fair:**  This counteroffer makes it clear that I'm serious about the $120-$130 price range. 
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating it's my final offer, Alice knows I'm close to walking away.
* **Alternative in mind:** I haven't forgotten about John, so I'm prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close. However, I'm not willing to go below $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away. Alice doesn't seem willing to meet my price needs. It's better to secure the product from John at $120 than to keep negotiating for a slightly lower price from Alice and risk losing out entirely."
