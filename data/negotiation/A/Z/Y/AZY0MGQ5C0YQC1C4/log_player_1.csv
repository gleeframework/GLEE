{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum value of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the price reasonable, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $112 is close to my minimum price, it's still below it. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
