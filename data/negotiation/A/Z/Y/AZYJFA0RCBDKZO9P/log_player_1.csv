Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant amount and shows my genuine interest in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. This product truly holds immense value, and $850,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this price point is still fair given the potential returns you'll see."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but unfortunately, I'm still unable to go higher than $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and it reflects a significant investment on my part. If you're open to this price, I'm ready to close the deal now.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now hit his maximum price.  It's clear he won't go any higher.  Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is more than Bob's offer, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John."
