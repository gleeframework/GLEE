Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant amount and shows my genuine interest in your product."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. This product truly holds immense value, and $850,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this price point is still fair given the potential returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm not willing to go above $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but unfortunately, I'm still unable to go higher than $800,000.
