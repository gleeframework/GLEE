"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $9,250?  It's closer to my ideal price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 is not possible, but I can go to $9,375. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you!",9375.0,Alice,5,
