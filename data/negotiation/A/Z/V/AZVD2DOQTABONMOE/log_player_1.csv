"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. I'm also highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,000? This still leaves room for you to save money compared to what the product is worth to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a good price.  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $12,250? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time and Bob's offer of $12,000 is a decent compromise. It's above his perceived value and closer to my desired price.  It's time to secure the deal."
