"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This price still leaves me a good profit, and I think it's fair for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
