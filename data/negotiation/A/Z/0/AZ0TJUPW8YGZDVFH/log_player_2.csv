"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($9,500 vs $10,000).**  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.**  You can always go to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This price still leaves me a good profit, and I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to your ideal price ($9,250 vs $9,000).** 
* **Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed.** 
* **You're already saving $750 compared to John's price.** The risk of further negotiation not yielding a better outcome is not worth the potential loss."
