"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also demonstrates that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell it for that low just yet. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product and believe it's worth more than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is close enough to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to sell it for more, the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's $100 offer isn't worth it. I'll accept the offer and secure a sale."
