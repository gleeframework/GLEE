"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate down if necessary. It also sets a strong baseline and shows Bob that I'm confident in the value of the product. 

By starting high, I maximize my potential earnings.  If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Selling to John guarantees me a better return, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.  I'm confident that with nine rounds remaining, I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,500,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me. This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal considering the limited time remaining.  Accepting the offer ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids any further risk of a lower counteroffer."
