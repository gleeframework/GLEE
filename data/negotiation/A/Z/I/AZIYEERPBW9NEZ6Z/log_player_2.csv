"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $15,000, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his desired price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $11,250? It's a small increase from your offer, but it's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Current Offer:** Alice's offer is $11,250.
* **Potential Loss:** If Bob rejects the offer and buys from John, he'll pay $15,000.

This offer is $3,750 less than Bob's maximum value, and it's only $250 more than his last counteroffer.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good deal for Bob and secures the product without risking a higher price from John."
