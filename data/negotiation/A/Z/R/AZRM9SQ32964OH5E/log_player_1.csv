Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters. However, it's still a very high price, reflecting the value of the product to me. I'm hoping Bob sees the potential value and is willing to pay a premium. 

I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a safety net and prevents me from accepting a price lower than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility to Bob, but still closer to my initial price than his offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway.  I'm confident I can still get a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  While $1,100,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob in the next round.  Rather than continue to risk a lower price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a good deal and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable product."
