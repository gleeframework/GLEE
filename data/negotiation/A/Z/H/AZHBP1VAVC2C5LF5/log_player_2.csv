"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
Reason:Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation.
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial counteroffer is intentionally low to leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Respectful Tone:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage a deal.
* **Clear Target:** By stating my price outright, I give Alice a clear understanding of my expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  There's clearly room for us to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

```
Reason: While Alice moved down significantly from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still a lot higher than both my budget and John's offer. There's room for more negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  Alice came down to $1,600,000, and I countered at $1,000,000. This offer sits slightly above the middle ground, acknowledging her concession but pushing for a price closer to my target.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting a specific number and framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit, encouraging her to agree.
* **Alternative Option:**  I still have the option of going with John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Alice at any cost."
