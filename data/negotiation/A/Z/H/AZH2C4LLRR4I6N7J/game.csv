"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $85 for it, which is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it, and it gives you a good profit margin.  Let's make this happen.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $100. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to get the product without breaking the bank.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100. I'll offer the product to you for $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,7,
