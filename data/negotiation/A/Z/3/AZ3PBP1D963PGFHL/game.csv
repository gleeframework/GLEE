"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $950000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
