"I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is the highest I'm able to go.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you considering its value to you is $8,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it has to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
