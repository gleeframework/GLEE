"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I believe this will encourage Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a deal that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am not yet satisfied with the deal. I believe I can still achieve a higher price by continuing the negotiation and exploring my counteroffer options in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I hope Bob will accept this counteroffer and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $95, Bob's offer of $88 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a deal that is significantly better than selling to John for $80.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to a deal with a lower price, or worse, no deal at all."
