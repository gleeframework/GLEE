Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to aim higher initially to see if we can secure a better deal than John's guaranteed $10,000 offer.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning another interested buyer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still likely settle on a price higher than $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
