"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $2,200,000 represents a significant discount from the true value and potential this product offers.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fairer compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside my range.  I'm  committed to a maximum of $800,000 for this product. If you're open to discussing a price closer to that, I'm ready to continue this conversation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
