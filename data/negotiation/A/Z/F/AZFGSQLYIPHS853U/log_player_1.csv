Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off right away. I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing confidence in the product's appeal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a little to $135. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 135}
