Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm offering it at a price of $950,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still ensuring you get a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning another buyer (John), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high but still potentially acceptable price gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a high price and not losing him to the guaranteed sale with John."
