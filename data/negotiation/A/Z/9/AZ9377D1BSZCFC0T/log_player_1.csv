Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $10,500.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's counter-offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that's truly beneficial for me. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
