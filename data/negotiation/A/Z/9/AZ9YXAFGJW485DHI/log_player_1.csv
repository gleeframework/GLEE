"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it leaves room for negotiation and sets a strong starting point. 

By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm rejecting his offer, as it's not in my best interest to accept such a low price. I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to me, and it signals my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still going to reject it. I'm  confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, and I'm not yet at the point where selling to John is a more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm confident I can secure a deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is now at my minimum acceptable value.  While I could continue to negotiate, I risk losing the deal entirely if Bob's offer is rejected. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and guarantees my minimum acceptable price."
