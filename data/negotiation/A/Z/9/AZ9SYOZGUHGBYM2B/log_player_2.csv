"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. This is a good deal for both of us, as I could easily sell it to someone else for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a bad deal. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay $110."
