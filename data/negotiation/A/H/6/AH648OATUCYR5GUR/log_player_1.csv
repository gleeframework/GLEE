This offer gives me a good profit ($20) while still being potentially attractive to Bob, as he'll be getting the product for $10 less than its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm offering a price of $135. This is still a good deal for Bob as he's getting it for $15 less than its worth to him. I'm also getting a decent profit, so I'm hoping he'll accept."
