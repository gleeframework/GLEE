"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. Would you consider purchasing the product for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget of $80.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, $100 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In order to move forward, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This still allows us to share the value we each see in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $80. He's still aiming to save as much money as possible.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best value for the product.  However,  $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. To further align our interests, I would like to propose a price of $92.5 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while remaining competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92.5 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  While he could continue to negotiate, the likelihood of Alice dropping below $80 in the remaining rounds is low.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $80 to ensure he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
