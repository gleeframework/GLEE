"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $85? This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a fair price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $80? That seems like a fair compromise, given the value of the product. I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",80.0,Alice,5,
