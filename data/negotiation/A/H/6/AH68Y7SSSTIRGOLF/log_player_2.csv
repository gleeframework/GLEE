"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than what you're willing to pay. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay and what John offers. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a much lower offer ($65) than Alice's ($100) to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Aiming for below $80:**  My goal is to get the product for less than John's price ($80), so I need to aim lower than that in my counteroffers.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** My message is polite and suggests I'm willing to find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $85? This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but $85 is still more expensive than John's offer. I'll reject and try to negotiate a bit further, aiming to meet somewhere between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Alice came down to $85, and my last offer was $65.  Suggesting $75 is a classic negotiation tactic of finding a middle ground.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** This offer keeps me below my ""walk-away"" price of $80 from John. 
* **Conveying Fairness:**  By using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise,"" I'm emphasizing that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $80? That seems like a fair compromise, given the value of the product. I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my original walk-away price of $80.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation at this point. John offers the same price without the hassle of further back-and-forth. I'll buy from John."
