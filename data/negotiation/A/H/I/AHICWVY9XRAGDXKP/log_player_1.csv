Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,500. I believe it offers exceptional value at this price."", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down. 
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a high initial price, I'm setting an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if the price eventually comes down, he'll be comparing it to the initial higher price, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:** I need to leave enough room to negotiate down to a price that's still significantly more appealing than John's guaranteed $10,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob might be willing to go slightly higher than his initial offer, especially if I can highlight the product's value further. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle between his offer and my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,000 is below its true value. Could you consider $11,750? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 11750}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($10,000) and my previous price ($13,500). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above John's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to stretch his budget.  I want him to understand why this price is justified. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not dropping my price too drastically, I'm maintaining some leverage in the negotiation. I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $10,000 is a fair price for this product. I would like to propose $9,500 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled that $9,500 is his absolute limit. This is below John's guaranteed offer. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Bob, and risks losing the guaranteed sale to John. It makes the most financial sense to accept John's offer at this point."
