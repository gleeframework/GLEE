Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $9,000. This allows for a healthy profit margin for you and saves me some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
