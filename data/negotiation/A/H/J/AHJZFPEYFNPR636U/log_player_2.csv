"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay from John, so I'll reject and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $300,000, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground.  I'm also leaving some room for negotiation in case she rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still far from what I'm willing to pay from John. I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering I'm still willing to pay a significant amount less than John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $450,000 is getting closer to my target price, and I'm willing to take the risk of not finding a better deal with only 5 rounds remaining. It's also much better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  I'll accept and secure the product."
