"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. While $900,000 is a fair starting point, I'm still looking to receive closer to my initial valuation.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is still a significant value for you, and it allows me to secure a reasonable return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

This is still a significant value for you, considering the product's potential, and it allows us to both walk away with a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
