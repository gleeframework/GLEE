Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,000,000, Bob represents a potential $950,000 sale. It's strategically better to aim for the higher price first.
* **Urgency and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and creates a sense of urgency with the ""one-time offer"" statement.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price isn't excessively high, leaving a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated, but still ensuring a significant profit for Alice."
