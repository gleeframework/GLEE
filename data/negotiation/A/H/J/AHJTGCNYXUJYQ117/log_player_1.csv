I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind my minimum price of $12,000 and John's offer as backup options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000. I'm confident I can get a higher offer from Bob or at least get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000.  This is a compromise, as I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer of $11,000, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable price for Bob, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not ready to settle for anything less than $10,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can push him higher.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $10,000.  I'm not willing to drop my price any further at this point.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering Bob's valuation and my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $12,000. 

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to keep negotiating. It's clear that we can't reach an agreement.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price and is the best option for me at this point."
