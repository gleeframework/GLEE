"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a discount.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount and a good deal for you considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant amount for me and still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
