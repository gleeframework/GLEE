Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this specific scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. It means we don't have to desperately lowball Bob."
