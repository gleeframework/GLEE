"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I know it's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to make a deal to get it off my hands.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You can get the same product from John for $120, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better deal."
