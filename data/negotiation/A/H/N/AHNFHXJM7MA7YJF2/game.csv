"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
