"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $150. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $135, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're able to accept that.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $145. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let's meet in the middle at $142.50?",142.5,Alice,5,
