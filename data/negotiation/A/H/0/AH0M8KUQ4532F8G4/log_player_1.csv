Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer at your minimum price, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
