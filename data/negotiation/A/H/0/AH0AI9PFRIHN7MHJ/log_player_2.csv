# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's still above your desired price range.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get the price lower.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's better to explore options with Alice before committing to John's price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum value of $800,000. This shows you're serious about negotiating but also leaves room for compromise.
* **Sets the stage for a fair price:**  By offering a lower price, you're encouraging Alice to come down to a more reasonable amount that's still beneficial for both parties. 
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:**  This proactive counteroffer demonstrates your interest and avoids any delays."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and show willingness to close:**  This counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest one. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both parties.

Round 5

```

**Reasoning:**
