Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be firm in my pricing.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefit,"" I aim to make the price feel more palatable."
