Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is already offering your minimum acceptable price. There is no room for further negotiation to increase your profit. Selling to John guarantees you your desired profit without the risk of further haggling."
