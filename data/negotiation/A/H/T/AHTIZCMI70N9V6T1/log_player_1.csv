{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I've aimed slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit.  I've also included a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm eager to sell, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below the product's true value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum value.  I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price."
