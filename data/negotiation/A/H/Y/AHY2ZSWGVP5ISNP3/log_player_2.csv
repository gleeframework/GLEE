"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should aim to get closer to her valuation of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me right now.  How about we bring it down to $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We want to start by anchoring the negotiation closer to Alice's valuation. By offering $10,500, we signal that we're serious about buying but also want a fair price. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate further. We're within our budget, and there are rounds left to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I could potentially do $10,750. It's a fair offer considering the market value."", 
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between our previous offer and her counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price. We're also subtly introducing the idea of ""market value"" to nudge her towards a more realistic valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  $10,750 is getting close, but I need to be at $10,900 to make this work. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we are now very close to her valuation. At $10,900, we're getting a good deal and further haggling may not yield a significantly better price. Accepting now secures the product at a good price without risking the deal falling through."
