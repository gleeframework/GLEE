Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your budget, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,300,000 to make this deal work. It's still a good price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer, Alice. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.  It's also much better than selling to John for $1,500,000 since that would take longer and involve more negotiation."
