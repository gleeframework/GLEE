"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $140 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145. This would be a fair price that we could both agree on. What do you think?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $145 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $155. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",155.0,Alice,5,
