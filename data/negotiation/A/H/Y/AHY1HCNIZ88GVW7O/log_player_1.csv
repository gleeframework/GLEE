Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $16,000. I believe it will be very beneficial for you."", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's value and your minimum allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This initial offer helps you understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Leave room for concessions:**  You can always come down in price during the negotiation, which often fosters goodwill and increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Alternative option:**  Keep in mind that you always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob offered his maximum price, which is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** While you won't get $16,000, there's a chance to negotiate a price higher than $10,000 and closer to your desired outcome. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and entering the next round of negotiation, you can try to find a compromise that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** By coming down from your initial price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Aim high but be realistic:** This counteroffer is still above both Bob's maximum and your minimum, providing room for further negotiation.
* **Maintain firmness:** The message emphasizes the product's value, reminding Bob that you're seeking a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to exceed $10,000 for this product. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm:** Bob has reiterated his maximum price of $10,000 multiple times. This suggests he's unlikely to budge.
* **Guaranteed profit:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000. This ensures you make a profit and avoids the risk of further unsuccessful negotiations with Bob.
* **Time saved:**  Selling to John avoids potentially lengthy and fruitless haggling with Bob. 

While you could try negotiating further with Bob, the potential gains seem minimal compared to the risk of losing a guaranteed sale at a price above your minimum."
