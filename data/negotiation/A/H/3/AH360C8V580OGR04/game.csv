"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go higher than $750,000. This is a significant investment for me, and this price allows us both to reach a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to move forward with the sale if you're willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
