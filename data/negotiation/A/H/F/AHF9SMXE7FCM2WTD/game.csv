"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is a significant way off from where I see this product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
