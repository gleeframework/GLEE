"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $130. It's a steal at this price!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation.  I'm confident I can get at least my minimum of $150 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price that's more fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is the maximum value he's willing to pay, and while it's below my minimum of $150, it's still a decent profit considering the alternative of selling to John for $150.  It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
