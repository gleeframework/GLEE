"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $130. It's a steal at this price!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $130 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

We're starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  There's a chance she might accept, and even if she doesn't, it gives us room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $100 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're now pushing for our maximum price. This will let Alice know our upper limit, but it's still a better deal than going with John right now.  There's a chance she might accept to avoid losing the sale."
