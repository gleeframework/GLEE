{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. While she has a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, there's room to negotiate with Bob for a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets the product for $100,000 less than its value to him, and Alice earns $100,000 more than her guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob could potentially counter-offer, allowing Alice to potentially earn even closer to her desired $1,200,000."
