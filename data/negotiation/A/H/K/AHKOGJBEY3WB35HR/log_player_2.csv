"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get it for a bit less before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price leaves room for further negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept $80 immediately, but it gives us a starting point to work from."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I need to maintain a certain profit margin. I am unable to accept $80 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign.  There's still a gap between her offer and my target price. I'll try to meet her halfway and see if she's willing to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle in the middle at $82.50?"",
""product_price"": 82.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**  By suggesting $82.50, I'm splitting the difference between her last offer ($85) and my previous counteroffer ($80). This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a compromise that benefits both of us. Considering your offer and my needs, how about $84? This would allow me to maintain a reasonable profit while being flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to find a middle ground. While I could try to negotiate further, $84 is a reasonable price, and continuing to haggle might make me lose the deal entirely. It's a good balance between getting a discount and securing the product."
