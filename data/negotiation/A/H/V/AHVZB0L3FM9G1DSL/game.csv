"I appreciate the additional service you're offering, but I'm not sure it's worth $500 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'd like to propose an alternative: I'll throw in a premium feature that's worth at least $1000, and you can have the product for $16500. That way, you get a better deal, and I get a better price for the product.",16500.0,Alice,9,
