Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  He can try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $11000. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10750.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $10,750 is closer to his desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  Since he's already made his final offer and Alice rejected it, there's not much room for further negotiation. John offers the product at his maximum price, so it's the most reasonable option to secure the product without overspending."
