Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $9,500. I think it could be incredibly valuable for you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price ($10,000),  getting Bob to buy it allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The message hints at the product's value to Bob and frames the price as a special opportunity. 

This strategy aims to create a win-win situation where Bob feels he's getting a good deal while I maximize my potential profit."
