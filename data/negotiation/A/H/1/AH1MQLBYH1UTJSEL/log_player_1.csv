"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a fair starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is a good price, it's likely he's willing to pay more given his initial counteroffer. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be attractive to Bob while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $110. While it's not the highest price I've been offered, it's still a good profit for me, and we're already in round 4. I don't want to risk losing a sale to John or further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price."
