"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,200,000 is still below what I consider a fair deal. I propose $1,300,000, which reflects the true value of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
