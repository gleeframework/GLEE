**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is cheaper than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $900,000, you are buying the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, meaning you can still make a profit.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision to save money."
