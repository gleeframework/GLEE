"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for $1,400,000. While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to negotiate to ensure a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door to potentially negotiating a better price with her, or simply proceeding to buy from John at your desired price."
