"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,500. Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $7,500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7250.0,Alice,5,
