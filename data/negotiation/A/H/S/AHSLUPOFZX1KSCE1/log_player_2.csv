"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below my $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $92.50 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and counter with something lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer by a smaller increment this time. I want to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we say $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle.  While I could try to push for a lower price, $95 is a reasonable deal and well within my budget. It's better to accept now than risk the negotiation falling apart."
