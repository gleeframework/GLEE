"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product that will greatly benefit your business. Please let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting her offer saves you money."
