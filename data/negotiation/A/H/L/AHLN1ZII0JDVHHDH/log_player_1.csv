"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a fair price, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and inviting Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that undervalues my product.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial bid. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also my firm stance on the product's value.
* **Message:** I'm reaffirming my commitment to a fair deal while acknowledging his counteroffer. 

I believe this strategy will push Bob further towards my desired price range while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns well with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good deal considering my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could potentially try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal completely.  It's better to secure a sale at a price that's still profitable for me."
