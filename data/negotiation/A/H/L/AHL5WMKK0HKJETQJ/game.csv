"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $12,500 is below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. How about we try to find a compromise at $12,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,750 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Perhaps we could agree on $13,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.
