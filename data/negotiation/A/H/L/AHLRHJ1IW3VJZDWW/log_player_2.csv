Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $10,500 is a good price for him, and it's still a better deal than buying from John.  He's saved money and gotten the product."
