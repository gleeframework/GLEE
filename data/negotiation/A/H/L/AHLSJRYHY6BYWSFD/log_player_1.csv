{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a decent discount, making it more likely he'll accept, while still allowing me to earn a good profit.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to purchase the product for $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still lower than what I'd be getting elsewhere. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750. That's a fair price for both of us and avoids the need to go back and forth any further. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. To avoid further back-and-forth and ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
