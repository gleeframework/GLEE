"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're looking for.",11250.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
