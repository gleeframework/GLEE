"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I could consider letting it go for $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $925,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
