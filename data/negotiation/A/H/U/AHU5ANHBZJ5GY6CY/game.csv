"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
