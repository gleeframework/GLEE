Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could share.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  Bob gets one chance to accept. If he declines, you walk away and sell to John.

**Strategic Offering**

You want to offer a price that is enticing to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Fair:** $1,150,000 is a significant chunk of the potential surplus ($150,000 for you, $50,000 for Bob). 
* **Time Pressure:** The ""one-time offer"" and mention of another buyer create urgency, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning the product's benefits to Bob adds a touch of justification for the price.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might try to counter-offer.  Be prepared to walk away if his counter-offer goes below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Psychology:** Presenting yourself as confident and firm in your offer can influence Bob's decision."
