**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $1,200,000
* **John's offer:** $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your ideal price point.  You can potentially negotiate with Alice further, but it's in your best interest to reject her offer for now. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can:

* **Explore other options:** Perhaps there are other sellers with lower prices, or you can negotiate a better deal with Alice.
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting the offer demonstrates your willingness to walk away, which could encourage Alice to lower her price in future negotiations."
