"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
