"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's better than John's price, Bob can likely negotiate a better price.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can likely get a better deal with a counteroffer.  Bob is still better off than buying from John, so it's worth continuing negotiations."
