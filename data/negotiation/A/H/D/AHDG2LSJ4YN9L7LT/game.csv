"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $950,000, considering its value to me and a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
