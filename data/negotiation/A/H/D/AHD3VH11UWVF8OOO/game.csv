"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and am open to discussing this further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is certainly attractive, I'm still confident in its higher value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This allows me to acknowledge your interest while still reflecting the product's true worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that would be beneficial for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
