Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
