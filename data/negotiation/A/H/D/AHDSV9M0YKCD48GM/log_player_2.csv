{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's a tough call, but in this situation, Bob should choose to buy from John. He's reached a point where he's unlikely to get a better price from Alice.  There's only one round left, and Alice's offer is the same as John's price.  To avoid the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer in the final round, Bob is better off securing the product at a known price from John."
