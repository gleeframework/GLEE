Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, which could still land you a higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Create Urgency:** By setting a high but not unreasonable price, you imply the product is in demand and encourage Bob to make a decision.

While there's a risk Bob might reject this offer, it's a calculated one. You're aiming for the best possible outcome before settling for your guaranteed $12,000 from John."
