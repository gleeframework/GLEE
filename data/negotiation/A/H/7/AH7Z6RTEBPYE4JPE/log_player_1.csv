Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also leaves a significant profit margin for Bob, making the offer appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above the price John is offering, it's still below my desired value.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  This counteroffer leaves room for a little more negotiation but also demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While this price is still below my ideal, it is a decent profit, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more.  It's also a significant amount more than selling to John."
