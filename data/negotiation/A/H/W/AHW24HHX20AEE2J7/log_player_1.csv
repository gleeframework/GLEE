Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone can make Bob more willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, so I'm leaving some room for a compromise. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a safety net and a point of reference for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I can still make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.  Since Bob is interested, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John is the Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. However,  $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's fair considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway to show flexibility, but still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm using the phrase ""split the difference"" to make the offer sound reasonable and appealing.
* **John as a Backup:** I'm still confident that I can sell to John for $150 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a Safe Alternative:**  I can get a better price from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a deal below my desired minimum.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's still potential for a counteroffer that might be closer to my target.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I'd like to get closer to $150,  rejecting Bob's offer at this point doesn't mean I'm guaranteed to lose the deal. I can still counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $95 is still a bit low for me, but I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $100. It's a compromise from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:**  I'm again offering a compromise, showing that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to go too low.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** $100 is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm still holding onto John as a potential buyer to keep the pressure on Bob and avoid settling for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, and I really think this product would be a great fit for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $92 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiations have gone back and forth for several rounds, and it's unlikely that Bob will budge much further.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  By selling to John, I avoid the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a price that's too low. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure the better deal."
