Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:** I'm highlighting the value he gets by buying the product for less than it's worth to him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price point allows for several rounds of counteroffers if needed. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be ready to counter his offer, keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could accept and sell to Bob, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000. This means I have room to negotiate with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'll aim to get as close to $12,000 as possible while still remaining above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and we're getting closer. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,500. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $10,500 is still significantly more than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000) and is much closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

I'm still aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I recognize the need to be flexible. If Bob rejects this offer, I will continue to negotiate while keeping in mind the potential sale to John for $15,000."
