"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable about the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1000000, which is the midpoint between our initial offer and your counteroffer. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1200000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're close to your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer $970000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",970000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $985000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",985000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $985000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $960000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet at a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $980000, which is the same price I offered in round 5. I'm hoping that this will be the final compromise we need to make a deal.",980000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1000000.",975000.0,Bob,10,
