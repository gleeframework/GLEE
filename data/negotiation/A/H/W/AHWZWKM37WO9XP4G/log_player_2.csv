"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than Bob's perceived value, it's still too high. Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $1,300,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's find a middle ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While $1,300,000 is a better price than $1,400,000, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price. Bob is also aware that he can buy from John for $1,500,000, giving him leverage to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us within a reasonable range. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the price John is offering, and it's close to Bob's last counteroffer.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will walk away or he'll need to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer maximizes Bob's savings and closes the deal."
