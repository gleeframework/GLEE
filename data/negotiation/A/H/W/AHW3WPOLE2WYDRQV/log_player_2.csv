"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you as well."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still a bit above what you're willing to pay.  You have two rounds remaining, and you can try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit more, especially considering your initial counteroffer was significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little hesitant at $1,050,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to proceed with this investment.  Would you be willing to consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1000000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1025000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  Alice has come down from her initial price, but she's still holding firm above your target.  You have 5 rounds left, but the risk of continuing is that Alice might not budge further. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price, and with limited rounds remaining, it's the safest option to secure the product."
