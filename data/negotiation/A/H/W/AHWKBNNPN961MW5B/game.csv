"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm sure we can find common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $12,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is still a bit too low. How about we compromise at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $12,500? That's my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
