"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850000. This price would be fair to both of us, allowing you a solid profit and me a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This would ensure a mutually beneficial transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,920000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $875000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your position, but $920000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $890000.  This offer would be a good middle ground, allowing you a solid profit while still saving me a substantial amount. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,,
