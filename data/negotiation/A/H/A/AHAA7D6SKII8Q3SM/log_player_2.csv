"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price down further, potentially saving a significant amount."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still higher than where you want to be.  You can likely push her down further, potentially getting closer to your desired price. You've already made a counteroffer, and rejected the offer.  If you continue to reject her counteroffer, the offer will likely drop again as Alice tries to avoid you walking away."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $875000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. She's come down a little, but her offer is still significantly higher than where you want to be. It's worth rejecting her offer and trying to get her down closer to your $875,000 target. By rejecting her offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a better price and that you're willing to walk away if necessary."
