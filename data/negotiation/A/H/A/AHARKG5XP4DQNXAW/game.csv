"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and my minimum price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll need to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
