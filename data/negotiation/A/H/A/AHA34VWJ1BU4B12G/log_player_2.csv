# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
