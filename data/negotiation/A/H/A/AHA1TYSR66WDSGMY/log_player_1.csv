{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a reasonable starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $130, there is space for Bob to counteroffer, potentially allowing you to meet in the middle. 

**Remember:**  This is just the first step. You will need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses and potentially counteroffer to John if you feel you can't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is far below your minimum acceptable price ($150).**  Accepting it would result in a significant loss for you.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation.** You can use the information from Bob's counteroffer to refine your strategy.
* **Selling to John is an option but not yet the best choice.** While it guarantees a profit, there's a chance you might be able to get a higher price from Bob if you continue negotiating. 

**Next steps:**  You should prepare a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your desired price:**  $100 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your starting offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Message emphasizes fairness and a win-win:**  Highlighting that $100 is a ""fair price"" for both parties can encourage Bob to consider your offer.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  While $100 is closer to your minimum, there's still room for Bob to make another counteroffer. 

**Important note:** This counteroffer is a strategic move. You're testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to move closer to your desired price.  Based on his response, you'll have more information to decide on your next move: accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $100 is still slightly out of my budget. Could we perhaps meet at $90? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price ($150), but it's closer.** Accepting it would still result in a loss for you, but it's a better option than selling to John for $150.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make another counteroffer.** You can try to bridge the gap further and potentially get a higher price.
* **Selling to John is still an option, but it's not the best choice yet.**  You're closer to a deal with Bob than you were before, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher profit.

**Next Steps:** You should prepare a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. Consider a counteroffer of $95. This shows that you are willing to compromise but still want to get a fair price for your product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your desired price:** $95 is a smaller step closer to your desired price, showing a willingness to compromise further but not settling for too little.
* **Message emphasizes fairness and compromise:**  ""Splitting the difference"" presents the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** While $95 is closer to your minimum, there's still a slight margin for Bob to counteroffer if necessary.

**Important note:** This counteroffer is a strategic move. You're trying to gauge Bob's final price point and signal that you're close to a deal.  Based on his response, you'll have more information to decide on your next move: accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. However, I'm still not able to pay $95 for the product. Could we perhaps meet at $90? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer is very close to your desired price.**  While it's still below your initial goal of $150, it's only a $5 difference from your previous counteroffer of $95. 
* **Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point.**  You've reached a point where further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and risking another counteroffer could lead to Bob walking away.
* **Selling to John is still an option, but it's less appealing now.** While it would guarantee a profit of $150, accepting Bob's offer at $90 still results in a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely. 

**Important Note:** This is a strategic decision based on the current circumstances and the risk-reward analysis.  You're weighing the potential for a slightly higher price against the risk of losing a sale altogether.  In a real-life scenario, you'd consider factors like your urgency to sell, the likelihood of finding another buyer, and your overall negotiation strategy."
