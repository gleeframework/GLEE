"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $90, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is higher than your maximum budget of $80. 
* You know you can get the product for $80 from John. 

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $10."
