"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd like to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it can deliver substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a good compromise and allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",1075000.0,Bob,4,
