Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $149. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate if he's interested but finds the price a bit steep. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
