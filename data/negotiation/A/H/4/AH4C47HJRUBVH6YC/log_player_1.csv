Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we could offer the product at $1,500,000 (our guaranteed price from John), there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him, and we make $350,000 more than what it's worth to us.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning another interested party introduces a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good deal with Bob and ensuring we don't miss out on a guaranteed sale to John."
