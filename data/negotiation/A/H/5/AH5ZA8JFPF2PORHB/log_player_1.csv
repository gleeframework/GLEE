# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've tried my best to negotiate with Bob, but we're at an impasse. It seems like I can't get him to budge much higher. While I'd prefer to make more money, John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident that I can get a quick and secure sale with him."
