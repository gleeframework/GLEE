Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $1,700,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

I'm lowering my offer to $1,850,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is still a good deal, exceeding John's offer by $150,000. It's time to accept and secure the sale."
