Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down somewhat, selling at $1,300,000 or close to it ensures a profit far exceeding John's offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to close the deal."
