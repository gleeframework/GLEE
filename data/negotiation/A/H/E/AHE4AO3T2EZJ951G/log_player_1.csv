"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $10,000, so I'm starting above that.
* **Bob's value:** I know Bob values the product at $12,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation.
* **First offer:** It's a good starting point, aiming for a decent profit while leaving room for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** While it's above my minimum, I can do better.

* **Next round:** Rejecting gives me a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  It was too low, but it shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **My counteroffer:**  I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaving some room for profit.
* **Strategic play:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** This is my minimum, so I'm not gaining anything further by continuing to negotiate.
* **John's offer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum, ensuring a guaranteed sale.
* **Time is valuable:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's better to secure the sale with John than to risk losing time and ultimately ending up with the same price."
