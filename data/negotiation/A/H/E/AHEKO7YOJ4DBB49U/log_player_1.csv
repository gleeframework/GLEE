Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth $800,000 to you. My initial price is $850,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price point. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is still a decent price, it's below my minimum value for the product.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $825,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my minimum value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, which would be $787,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $787,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to take one more round of negotiation with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $787,500 is still too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $805,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's finalize this deal at this price, and both of us can walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 805000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $805,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $795,000 and $805,000, which would be $800,000. However, I'd like to make a slight adjustment to $797,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $797,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $797,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $797,500 is very close to my minimum value, I'm not confident that I can get Bob to go higher. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing the deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, so it's the safer and more sensible option."
