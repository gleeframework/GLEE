Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000. This presents an opportunity to earn a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a comfortable margin for you while still being attractive to Bob (he saves $100,000).  
* **Time Constraint:** Adding a 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the highest possible price and ensuring Bob doesn't reject the offer outright."
