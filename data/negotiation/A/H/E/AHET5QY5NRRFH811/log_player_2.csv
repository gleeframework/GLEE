"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). This means there's room for negotiation and I can likely get a better price.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering me.  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $92.50. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay up to $90, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. I'm still a little above my target price. How about $87.50? That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still looking to maximize my earnings. I'm willing to meet you at $89.25. It's a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89.25 is very close to my target price of $90. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potential delays. Buying from John for $120 would be significantly more expensive, so this is the best option."
