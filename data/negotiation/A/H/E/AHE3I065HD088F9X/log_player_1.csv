{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his maximum offer of $1,000,000. It's clear he won't go any higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it makes no financial sense to continue negotiations with Bob. Accepting John's offer maximizes your profit."
