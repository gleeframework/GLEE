"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer was already quite fair. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept a price as low as $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $1,100,000, which represents a significant discount from your initial offer and is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It's clear this product holds significant value for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,137,500? This demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise while still reflecting the product's worth.",1137500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting a strong feeling we're on the verge of a great deal! To solidify that, I'm willing to go up to $1,120,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",1120000.0,Bob,6,
