"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $80? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd be happy to sell it to you for $120. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a little high for my budget.  How about $100? I'm really interested in this product and think we can make this work.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, which would be $110. I think that's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $105.  I'm sure we can find a solution we're both happy with.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. I think that's a fair compromise.",107.5,Alice,7,
