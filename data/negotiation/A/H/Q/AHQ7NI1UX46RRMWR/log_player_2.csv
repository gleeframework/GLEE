# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I think this is a fair starting point.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is higher than $900,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to be transparent about the product's value, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm still willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a slight concession, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below this price point and it's not worth continuing the negotiation.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 ensures you get the product at the best possible price."
