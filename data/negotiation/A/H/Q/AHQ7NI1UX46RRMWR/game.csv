"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I think this is a fair starting point.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is higher than $900,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, I can get the product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  To make this work for me, I'd need you to come down to that price.  Would you be willing to do $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to be transparent about the product's value, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm still willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a slight concession, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
