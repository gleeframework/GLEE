Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth so much to you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, making it attractive to Bob. It's also a decent profit for me.
* **The message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value to Bob. I'm not pushing too hard, giving him room to counter if he wants. 

**Strategy:**

This is a starting point.  I'm setting a price I'm comfortable with, but I'm also open to negotiation.  I'll use the information from Bob's response (or lack thereof) to make further decisions.  If he rejects, I'll either counteroffer again or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,050 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer, it's not enough to make me feel comfortable selling it.  I'm going to try and get closer to my target price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my desired price.  I want to stay above $12,000, so I might try something like $11,500.  I'll keep in mind that I can always go to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,050 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This would be a great price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This strategy aims to find a compromise. By suggesting $11,250, I'm offering a midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,050. 
* **Highlighting the benefits:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a good deal for both of us, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is still above my minimum price of $15,000. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to convince Bob. If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate my options, considering another counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I really like the product, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, the negotiation is going nowhere, and I'm not comfortable accepting a price that low.  I'm better off selling to John for $15,000 and securing a guaranteed profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Difference:**  The gap between my minimum price and Bob's offer is too large, making further negotiation unproductive.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely require more rounds and may not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

It's more beneficial for me to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $15,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob."
