"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10050.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,050 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This would be a great price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I really like the product, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
