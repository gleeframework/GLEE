"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective on the value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle at $10,250?  That's my final offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
