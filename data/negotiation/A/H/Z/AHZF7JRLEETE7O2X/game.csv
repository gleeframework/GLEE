"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm open to negotiation. My starting price is $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still below what it's worth to me. Let's find some common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to be reasonable. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $1,300,000 is still not in the range I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to be as cost-effective as possible. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to find a price that works for both of us. I'm committed to getting a fair price for this product, and $1,250,000 just doesn't cut it.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000 as a final offer. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's up to you now.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but no more.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
