Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell for less than its value.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Offering Bob the product first creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency. He might be willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out. 
* **Negotiation Buffer:** The $15,000 offer provides a buffer for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John. 

**Important:** This strategy balances risk and reward. While a higher initial offer could lead to higher profit, there's a chance Bob might reject it outright. However, having John as a guaranteed backup buyer mitigates this risk."
