"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further with Alice to try and get a lower price."

Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. I hope you'll consider my offer and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,350,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You can either counteroffer again, or see if you can reach a compromise with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, which is a slight compromise from my original price. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still slightly above your maximum budget. Since you can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, it's better to go with John's offer and save $125,000."
