"Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is only $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is already a very competitive price for a product of this quality.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only afford $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad you're serious about the product. It's clear how valuable it would be for you.  How about $12,500?  That's my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
