"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us, $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product holds significant value. How about we settle at $1,160,000? I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",1160000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,160,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,190,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the worth you'll gain from it.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
