"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000 for your product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1700000? That's a significant discount from my initial price and still allows you to get a great deal on this valuable product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product is higher than what I'm willing to pay, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
