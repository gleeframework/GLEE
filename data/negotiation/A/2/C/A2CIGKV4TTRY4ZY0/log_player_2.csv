It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so there's room to bargain."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal.

While $825,000 is closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You are willing to pay $800,000, so there's still room to bargain."
