"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While we aim to accommodate all potential buyers within their budget constraints, I am unable to match the requested price of $1050000. However, I am willing to consider a higher offer to ensure both parties benefit from this transaction. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $1075000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations and looks forward to your response.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
