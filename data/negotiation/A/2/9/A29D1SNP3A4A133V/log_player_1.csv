Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still very fair.  My offer is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a compromise price.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **This offer provides a potential win-win situation.** Bob gets a good deal, and I get a better price than I would from John. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  It highlights the potential benefits for Bob and aims to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer. The optimal price depends on your negotiation skills and your assessment of Bob's willingness to pay."
