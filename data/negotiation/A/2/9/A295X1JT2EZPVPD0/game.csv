"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $130.  How about we meet in the middle again at $131.25?  It's a small difference, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",131.25,Alice,5,
