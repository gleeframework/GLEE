Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it for $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I could come down to $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move on the price. To be honest,  $18,000 is still a bit outside of what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I can't go as low as $10,000, but to demonstrate my willingness to make a deal, I can offer it for $15,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down.  However, to be realistic, $15,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly under the product's value to me and my fallback option with John. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.  I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
