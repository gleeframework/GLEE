"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it for $22,000.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I could come down to $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move on the price. To be honest,  $18,000 is still a bit outside of what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I can't go as low as $10,000, but to demonstrate my willingness to make a deal, I can offer it for $15,500. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down.  However, to be realistic, $15,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,6,
