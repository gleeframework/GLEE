Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100), and it leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $100, so there's no risk involved in trying to get a higher price."
