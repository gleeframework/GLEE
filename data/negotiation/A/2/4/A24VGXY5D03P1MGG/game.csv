"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm not looking to break the bank. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
