"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $11,500 for the product. This price still reflects the value of the product to both parties and aims to find a mutually beneficial solution. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
