Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To find a middle ground, I could consider $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be mindful of the product's true worth.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach a number that beats John's offer of $1,000,000. It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the product at the best possible price from John.  Continuing with Alice holds the risk of her final offer still being above $1,000,000."
