"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. Offering $8,500 shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000), and Bob gets a decent discount from his initial target of $8,500.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer in Round 3 is a good strategy to save time and ensure a deal.  It's also a good starting point to build a good relationship with Alice for future potential deals."
