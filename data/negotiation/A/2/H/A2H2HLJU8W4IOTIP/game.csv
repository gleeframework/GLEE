"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will work for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,680,000. This is a price that I believe reflects the product's true value, but I'm still willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1680000.0,Alice,5,
