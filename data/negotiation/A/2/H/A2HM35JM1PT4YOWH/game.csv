"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500? This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
