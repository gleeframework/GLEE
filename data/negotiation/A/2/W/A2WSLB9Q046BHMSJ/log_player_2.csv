"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob and Alice is offering it for the same price, Bob can reject the offer. He can then buy the product from John for the same price. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
