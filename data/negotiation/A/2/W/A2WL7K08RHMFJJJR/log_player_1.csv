{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This reflects the value I know it holds, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited to $800,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, and if that fails, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting the value I know this product holds for you. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm ready to go to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's increased offer, $850,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to accept anything below $900,000.  I'll counteroffer him again and see if we can reach a compromise.  If not, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000.
