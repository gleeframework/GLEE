"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but $95 is still too close to that limit.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:** Having the option to buy from John for $120 gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** I'm starting by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see how flexible Alice is. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $100 is still closer to my maximum than I'd like.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  Alice has shown some flexibility, and I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still an option:** Having the option to buy from John gives me leverage and limits the risk of accepting a price I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm now offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** I'm trying to gauge if Alice is willing to meet me in the middle. 
* **Staying within my budget:**  $90 is still within my budget and a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $105 is close to my maximum, and I'm still hoping to get a better deal.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe I can get a price closer to my target with another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  Having the option to buy from John gives me a safety net if negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm now offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to reach a compromise. 
* **Balancing my budget:**  $95 is still within my budget but represents a significant saving from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Final push:** This is likely my last counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $110 is still too close to my maximum, and the negotiations seem to be stalling.
* **Limited time and leverage:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. 
* **Buying from John is a better option:**  At this point, buying the product from John for $120 is the safer and more efficient choice.  I've saved a significant amount from Alice's initial offer, and the potential savings of a few more dollars isn't worth the risk of the negotiation failing."
