"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this item, but I can only offer $800000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000. This is my final offer, as I can always go with John's offer at that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
