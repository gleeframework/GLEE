Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit by getting as close to $1,500,000 as possible.

**Strategy**

Start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Aim for a price that's significantly more than your minimum but less than Bob's maximum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to own the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to gain a significant advantage."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 gives you a strong profit margin ($350,000 over your minimum) while leaving Bob with a potential $150,000 gain. 
* **Positive Language:**  Framing it as an ""opportunity"" and a ""fair reflection"" encourages Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can slightly reduce the price, but always keep your $1,000,000 minimum in mind."
