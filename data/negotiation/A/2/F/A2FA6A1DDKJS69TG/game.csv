"Alice, your product looks great, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. My current assessment of the product's value suggests we should aim for a higher price to ensure mutual satisfaction. I would like to propose an offer of $160 for the product. This price reflects the product's quality and the value it brings to you. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $150, which is a fair price for both of us. This would be a good deal for you, as it's above what you consider the product to be worth. Let's see if we can make this work.",150.0,Bob,4,
