Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go over $850,000. This is my absolute top offer, considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product goes well beyond that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects its intrinsic worth and potential returns. Let me know if this revised price works for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident this product holds great value, but my budget remains at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price point that reflects the product's true value to me. John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 makes more sense at this point, ensuring I don't undervalue the product in a drawn-out negotiation."
