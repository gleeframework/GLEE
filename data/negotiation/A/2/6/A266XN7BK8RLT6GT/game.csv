"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. I'm happy to offer it to you at the price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the price I was quoted by another seller. Can you meet me in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to you is significant, and my price reflects that. I could come down to $18,000, but that's my best offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. I'm thinking $15,500 is a fair price for this product. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,4,
