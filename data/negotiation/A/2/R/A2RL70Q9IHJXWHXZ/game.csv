"I appreciate your initial offer, and I'm glad we could start discussing the price. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price point reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value I see in the product with the price I'm willing to pay.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,
