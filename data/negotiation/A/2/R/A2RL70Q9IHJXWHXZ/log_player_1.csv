Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, and I'm glad we could start discussing the price. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value I see in the product with the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob is clearly willing to move towards my ideal price, and $1,000,000 is a significant profit. There's no guarantee I can get more from him in future rounds, and it's not worth risking the $800,000 guarantee from John."
