"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. Would you be willing to go down to $127? I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",127.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $127 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $129.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $129. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $127 and $129, which would be $128. Can you consider that?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for the best deal, but $128 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $129, but that's my final offer.  It's a great price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know if you're interested.",129.0,Alice,7,
