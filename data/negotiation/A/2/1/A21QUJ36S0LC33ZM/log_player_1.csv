I'm starting with an ambitious price of $15,000. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to earn more than my minimum value of $10,000. I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get more. I believe I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping that this will be a sweet spot where Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my desired price. I'm not confident I can push for much higher, and I'm also concerned about wasting more time negotiating. It's time to secure a deal before I risk losing out to John's guaranteed offer."
