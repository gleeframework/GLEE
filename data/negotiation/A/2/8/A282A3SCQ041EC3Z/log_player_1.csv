Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm aiming for a price as close as possible to my minimum acceptable price. This offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, and I can adjust accordingly.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides me with leverage in negotiations. If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I can easily walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for better deal:**  While Bob is willing to pay something, his counteroffer shows he's motivated. I can potentially negotiate a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **John as safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob break down. This gives me the freedom to reject Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $11,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This makes the offer appear reasonable and fair.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm not completely rejecting him either. This keeps the door open for further negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'm confident I can do better than $9,500, but if Bob rejects my counteroffer, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your proposal, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a quick deal:** Accepting this offer allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid further negotiations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, there's a chance Bob could reject my next counteroffer.  Accepting his offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if something goes wrong. 

**Ultimately, I'm choosing a safe and fairly lucrative option to secure the sale.**"
