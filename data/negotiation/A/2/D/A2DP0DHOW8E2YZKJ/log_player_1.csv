Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price, especially given that I have the option to sell to John for a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I still have the option to sell to John for a higher price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to see a higher offer from him in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been negotiating for a while, and Bob's offer isn't getting close enough to what I need. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I can't risk losing a significant amount of money. John is offering my minimum price, and I'm not going to risk it by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
