"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This gives you a good deal and allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value our ongoing discussion, $950,000 is still unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not able to go lower than $1,000,000. This price still offers you a significant advantage over acquiring the product elsewhere.  Let's aim for a final agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
