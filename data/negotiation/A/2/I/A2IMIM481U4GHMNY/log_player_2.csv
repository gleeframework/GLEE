Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This gives you a good deal and allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can close this deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value our ongoing discussion, $950,000 is still unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not able to go lower than $1,000,000. This price still offers you a significant advantage over acquiring the product elsewhere.  Let's aim for a final agreement at this price.
