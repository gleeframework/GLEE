You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $115. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $112 is still within your budget of $120, and it's lower than her initial offer.  Since you've already rejected one counteroffer, it's likely Alice is becoming less willing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product while saving a bit of money."
