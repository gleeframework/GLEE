"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to drop the price to $1,300,000.  This is still a significant discount from my true value and a fantastic deal for you.  Let's get this done.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a good compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further delays.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
