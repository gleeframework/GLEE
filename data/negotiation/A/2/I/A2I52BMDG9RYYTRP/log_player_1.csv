Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is still a significant discount from my true value and a fantastic deal for you.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a good compromise.
