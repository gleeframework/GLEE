""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price that secures the maximum possible profit from Bob while still ensuring the deal is attractive to him.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**The Offer:**

The offered price of $1,350,000 represents a significant profit margin for you while still leaving Bob with a potential gain of $150,000.  This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
