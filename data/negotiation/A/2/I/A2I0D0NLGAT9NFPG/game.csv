"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
