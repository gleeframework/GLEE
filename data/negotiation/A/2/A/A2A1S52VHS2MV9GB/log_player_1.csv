Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong buyer interested at a higher price point. Please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value and the existence of another buyer. This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,150,000 is a significant profit for Alice (above her minimum) and still offers Bob a good deal compared to the product's worth to him ($1,000,000).

This strategy balances securing a sale with maximizing potential profit."
