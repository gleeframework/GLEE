""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Would you consider $1,025,000? This offer reflects its worth while recognizing your interest."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you consider $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and show my commitment to the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $950,000 is a significant loss compared to John's offer. It's worth seeing if we can get Bob closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $985,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $985,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $975,000? I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to our acceptable range, but we can still push a bit further.  We are willing to go as low as $980,000, and it's worth seeing if he'll agree before accepting a lower offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make this deal work for us. How about we settle this right now at $980,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We've reached a point where we need to be firm. This offer is our bottom line, and presenting it as a final offer adds weight to the negotiation. Bob will likely recognize we're serious and hopefully accept. If he rejects this, it might be time to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Would you consider $955,000? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has countered with a final offer that's significantly lower than our last offer. He seems unwilling to budge past $960,000, and we've been clear on our $980,000 bottom line. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a substantial amount compared to John's offer. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
