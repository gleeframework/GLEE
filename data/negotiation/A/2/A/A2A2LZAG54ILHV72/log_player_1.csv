Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a ""great deal"".
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, leaving the door open for further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on how close it is to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* If negotiations stall or I feel I'm not getting a good price, I can always sell to John for $100 as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $95 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, which is what I can get from John. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  I can still get a better price than Bob's offer. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll continue negotiating until either we reach a mutually acceptable price or I decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $105.  This product is truly valuable, and I think it's worth that investment for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm counter-offering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Open to compromise:** I'm emphasizing the need to find ""common ground"", suggesting a willingness to negotiate further. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $100 and the potential sale to John."
