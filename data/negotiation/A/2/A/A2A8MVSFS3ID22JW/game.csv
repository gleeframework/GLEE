"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be happy to pay $10000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
