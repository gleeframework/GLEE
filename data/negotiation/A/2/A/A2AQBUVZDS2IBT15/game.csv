"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1100000. I think this is a fair and competitive offer, considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1000000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'll make a new offer: I'll sell the product to you for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $975000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $925000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,
