"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:**  I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I express a willingness to discuss the price, showing flexibility. 

I'm aiming to get a price as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still not a good deal for me.  I have 8 more rounds to work with, and I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a valuation, and I'm willing to work with you, but I need to see a price closer to $1,800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** I state clearly that his offer is too low.
* **Compromise:**  I acknowledge Bob's valuation and express a willingness to negotiate.
* **New counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. I'm aiming for a gradual negotiation, trying to find a middle ground.
* **Staying firm:** I reinforce the importance of a fair price for me. 

I hope that by demonstrating willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance, I can secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Considering that we have only six rounds left, it's a good opportunity to close the deal and secure a profitable sale.  While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential gains at this point."
