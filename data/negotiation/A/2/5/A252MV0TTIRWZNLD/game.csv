"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not quite ready to accept $875,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $925,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
