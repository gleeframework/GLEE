Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Overpricing:** Starting with an offer of $18,000 leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will immediately accept, but it sets a higher anchor point for the discussion. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counter-offer is too low, you can always walk away knowing you have John as a backup."
