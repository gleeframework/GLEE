Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher initial offer gives me more room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Test Bob's interest:**  If Bob is genuinely interested, he might be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **Psychological advantage:** A high initial offer might create a sense of urgency or scarcity in Bob's mind."
