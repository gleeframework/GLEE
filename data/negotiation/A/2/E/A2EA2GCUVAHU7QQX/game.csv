"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
