```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** Bob is aiming to get a lower price than Alice's initial offer.  
* **Strong Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his lower price, making it more likely Alice will take him seriously.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $850000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price for this product anywhere else.

Round 9

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

* **Limited Time:**  This is the penultimate round, and Bob needs to make a decision.
* **Small Gap:** There's only a $7,500 difference between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While negotiating further might get Bob a better price, there's a risk that he might not reach an agreement with Alice and be forced to pay John's higher price.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is a guaranteed transaction and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

Bob is close to his target price, but it's not worth risking a failed deal with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the purchase and limits Bob's overall losses."
