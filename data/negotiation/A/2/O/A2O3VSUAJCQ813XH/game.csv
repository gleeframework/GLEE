"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make sure I get at least $10,500 for it.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is a compromise for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
