"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair compromise that still reflects its value to you.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $75.  It's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $75, but I'm still not comfortable selling it that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $79. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to you.",79.0,Alice,5,
