"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting its worth.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $825,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $760,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're making a significant move, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",795000.0,Alice,5,
