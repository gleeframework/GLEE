Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price. This puts you in a strong position.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  There's no point in offering a price below your guaranteed amount. By starting at $1,000,000, you give yourself room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates while still ensuring you get your minimum.
* **Confident Language:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity to entice Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, there's always a slight risk Bob might not accept. However, given the potential profit, it's strategically sound to aim high initially."
