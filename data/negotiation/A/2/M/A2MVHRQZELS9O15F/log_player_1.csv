Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we settle at $1,275,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
