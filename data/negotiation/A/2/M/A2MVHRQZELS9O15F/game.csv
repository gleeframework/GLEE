"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 just isn't enough for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we settle at $1,275,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
