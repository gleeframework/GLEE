Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so he has room to negotiate without feeling like he's losing out.
* **It opens the door for negotiation:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the price. 

By starting with a reasonable offer and being open to negotiation, you increase the chances of reaching a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is close to your minimum and still allows you to make a profit.  It's a good deal for you, and you don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
