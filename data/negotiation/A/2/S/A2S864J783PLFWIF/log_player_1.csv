"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile. Taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is the best business decision at this point."
