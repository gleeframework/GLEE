It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  She's holding firm at $13,000, and has even called it her ""final offer.""  You've been reasonable with your counteroffers, and it's unlikely she'll come down further. You have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000, which meets your needs and saves you money."
