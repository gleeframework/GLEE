"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be open to $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $12,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'm offering $13,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  $12,500 is still a bit low for me, but I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $13,000. This is my final offer.  It's fair and reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
