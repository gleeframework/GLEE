"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11500? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,5,
