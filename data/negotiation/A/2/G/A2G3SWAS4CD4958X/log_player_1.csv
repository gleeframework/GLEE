Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before it hits the general market. I believe it would be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $18,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your walk-away price:** You have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, so that's your minimum.
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it at $25,000 would be immediately rejected. There's a chance he might be willing to go slightly above his valuation, especially if he sees the product as valuable in the long run.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $18,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. This strategy maximizes the potential profit while still maintaining a price above your guaranteed sale."
