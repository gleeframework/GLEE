"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $9,750 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $10,125 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,5,
