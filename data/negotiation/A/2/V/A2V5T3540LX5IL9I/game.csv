"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. I'm proposing a price of $1350000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1325000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1325000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1337500? This would be a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
