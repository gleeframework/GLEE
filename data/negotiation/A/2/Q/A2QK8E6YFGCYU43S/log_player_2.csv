"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  I think you'll agree it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's a good idea to try to negotiate a lower price. You can start by making a counteroffer, as it's not worth paying $18,000 when you can get the same product from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $18,000 is really my bottom line to make this work. I'm confident you won't find this product for a better price elsewhere.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $18,000, which is still significantly above your budget.  You've already made a counteroffer and she rejected it.  At this point, it's clear she's not willing to negotiate further.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $10,000 to stay within your budget."
