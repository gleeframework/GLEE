"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good starting point to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a very fair price, considering your minimum is $800,000 and my maximum is $800,000. Let's get this deal done.",825000.0,Bob,4,
