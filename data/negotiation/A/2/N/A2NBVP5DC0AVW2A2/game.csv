"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts on this?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to both of us, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a significant offer, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $987,500? That's closer to my initial offer and represents a significant savings for me.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, finding a solution that works for both of us is key.  Let's aim for a round number - how about $1,010,000? That's acknowledging your willingness to move while recognizing the inherent value of what I'm offering.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and we're definitely making progress. I'm still not quite there. How about $995,000?  That's a significant amount of savings for me, and we can close the deal quickly.",995000.0,Bob,6,
