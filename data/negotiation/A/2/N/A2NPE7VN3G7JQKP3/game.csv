"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,350,000?  This price reflects the significant value this product holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider $1,250,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,300,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied with this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
