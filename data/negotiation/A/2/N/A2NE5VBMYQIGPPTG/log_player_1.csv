"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm confident in the product's value and want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price but demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me feeling like I've settled for less than the product is worth. I'll counter again in the next round, but if the negotiations continue to stall, I may have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm hoping that this offer will finally be acceptable to Bob, but if it isn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid further loss of potential profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob. His offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made significant concessions.  To avoid further negotiation and potential losses, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair and acceptable offer that secures my minimum desired profit."
