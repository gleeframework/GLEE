"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1000000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no reason to accept it immediately. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also signals that I believe the initial offer was too high. 
* **Significant discount:** A $250,000 reduction is a good starting point for negotiation, and still leaves room for Alice to come down a bit. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message clearly states my willingness to negotiate and encourages Alice to respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise, though.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $850000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and allows you to get a great deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a significant reduction from her initial price, it's still higher than my counteroffer. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let's try $800,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shows compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet Alice halfway, which strengthens my position.
* **Reasonable price:** $800,000 is a good middle ground between my last offer and Alice's.
* **Appeals to mutual benefit:** The message highlights how this price is advantageous for both of us, making it more likely for Alice to accept."
