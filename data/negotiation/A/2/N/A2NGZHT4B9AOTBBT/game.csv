"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest in the product. However, $700000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $650000 for it. This price is still within a reasonable range given the value you've mentioned. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product.",675000.0,Alice,3,
