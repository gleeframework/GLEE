Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $130. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for a potential profit for me.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging. It highlights the value of the product and tries to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  While I could try to get closer to my minimum of $150, there's a higher chance Bob will reject a higher price. 
* **Minimizes risk:**  At $130, there's a decent chance Bob will accept, and even if he doesn't, I still have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me my minimum value."
