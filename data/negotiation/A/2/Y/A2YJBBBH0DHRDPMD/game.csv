"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can come up with something closer to what you're suggesting. My counteroffer would be $1050000.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still think $1050000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm going to propose $1075000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. Let me think about this for a moment. I'll counter with $1062500.",1062500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still think we can do better than $1062500. I'm willing to come down to $1075000 was a stretch for me, so I'm going to try to meet you halfway from there. I'll propose $1092500. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",1092500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1081250, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms. I'll sell the product to you for $1081250, but I'd like to include a small consulting fee of $50000 on top of that. This way, we can both walk away happy. What do you think?",1131250.0,Alice,9,
