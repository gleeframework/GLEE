"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a great price for a product that's worth significantly more to you.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to secure a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left to close the deal, so Bob can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. This is a significant amount of money, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.  This price is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is now within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and is significantly lower than John's offer. This is a good deal for Bob, allowing him to save a considerable amount of money. 

While Bob could potentially push for a lower price, it's risky.  There are only 5 rounds remaining, and Alice might not be willing to go lower. It's better to secure this deal and avoid the risk of losing out to John or running out of time."
