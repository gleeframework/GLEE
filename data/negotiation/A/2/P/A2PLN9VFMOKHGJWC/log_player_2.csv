"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and expectations. Given its high value and quality, it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Considering this, I propose to sell it to you for $9,500. This price not only reflects the product's true worth but also offers you a significant discount compared to its market value. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500, which is higher than the product's worth to you ($8,000).** 
* **You can get the product for $10,000 from John.** This is the best deal, as it's closer to your maximum budget and still slightly lower than Alice's offer."
