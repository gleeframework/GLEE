Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,250,000, and it's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 than risk losing it entirely."
