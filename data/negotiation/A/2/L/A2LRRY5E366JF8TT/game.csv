"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far off from that price point.  Would you consider $760,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering my budget.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $795,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",795000.0,Alice,5,
