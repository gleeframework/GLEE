"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't sell it to you for $8000. That's my minimum price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit below my target. How about we meet at $10500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
