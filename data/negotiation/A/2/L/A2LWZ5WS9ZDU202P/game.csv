"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is my final compromise on the price, but I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $12500? I think that's a fair price for this unique item.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $14500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $14500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but I need to know if you're willing to accept it. Can you consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already made several concessions, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $14750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for what you'll be getting.",14750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $13000. I've already exceeded my budget, and I need to be responsible with my finances. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",13000.0,Bob,10,
