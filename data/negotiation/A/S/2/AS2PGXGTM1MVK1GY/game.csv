"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $108?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $104?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",104.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $104, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we try $106?",106.0,Alice,7,
