Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a sense of a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures that you are still making a profit even if Bob accepts the initial offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you have space to adjust the price further.

However, remember that you can always choose to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob become too difficult or time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with its value to me. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for that price. It's better to risk a few more rounds of negotiation or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to sell for $9,000. This still represents a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would prefer to stay within my budget of $8,000, I am willing to consider $9,000 as a compromise. This still allows me to save some money compared to buying from another seller. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It meets my minimum price requirement while still allowing Bob to get a good deal.  Selling to John for $10,000 would be ideal, but accepting this offer is a reasonable and profitable choice."
