"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with its value to me. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to sell for $9,000. This still represents a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I would prefer to stay within my budget of $8,000, I am willing to consider $9,000 as a compromise. This still allows me to save some money compared to buying from another seller. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
