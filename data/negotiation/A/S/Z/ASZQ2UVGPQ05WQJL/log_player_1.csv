{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $100.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You're aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation to get the highest possible profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $140 is your initial offer, there might be a chance to negotiate slightly down if Bob hesitates, but still well above your minimum.
* **Staying Above Your Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you are guaranteed $100 from John."
