{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  It leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It states the price directly and invites Bob to respond. 

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a potential win-win negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While $987,500 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm concerned that Bob might not budge much further. It's also more than what John is offering, so accepting this deal is the best choice at this point."
