{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum, which is $10,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** It's lower than what Bob is willing to pay, so there's potential for him to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have room to negotiate and still get a good price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $11500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $1,500 less than your ideal price.  It's significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that you'll spend too much time haggling and lose the opportunity.  Accepting his offer is the most reasonable choice, as it ensures a sale at a good price."
