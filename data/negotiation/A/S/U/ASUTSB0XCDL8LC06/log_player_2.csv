Round 3

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is not willing to go down to his $120 limit, and he has already rejected her offer of $155.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product for the price he is willing to pay, and he has 5 rounds remaining in case he wants to continue negotiating with Alice later."
