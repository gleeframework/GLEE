"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  My asking price is $1,400,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to potentially make him more motivated to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I'm not going to immediately jump to my minimum of $1,500,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I understand Bob's budget constraints, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a significant financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **John is a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage to potentially push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a counter that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in to Bob's initial low offer.
* **Focus on finding common ground:**  I'm emphasizing the need for compromise and finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though it's a slight increase, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile for me.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safe option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to push Bob further in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Compromise:** I'm continuing to compromise, but still moving in smaller increments to see if Bob will meet me halfway.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to potentially push him to budge further. 
* **Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing that my offer is a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,220,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he's shown willingness to negotiate, the gap is still significant.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  I'm worried that if I continue to counteroffer, we might reach a stalemate where neither of us is willing to budge further.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have John's offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net.  I don't want to risk losing out on that for a significantly lower offer from Bob. 

I'm going to make one final counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price, but if Bob rejects it, I'm going to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to come down to $1,220,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer a final price of $1,260,000. This is my absolute minimum, and if you're unable to meet that, I'm going to have to explore other options. I truly believe this product is worth it to you, and I hope we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1260000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, and I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasis on Other Options:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have other options available to me, which puts pressure on him to come to an agreement. 
* **Value Reiteration:** I'm once again reiterating the value of the product to Bob to try and convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,220,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Despite several rounds of negotiation, we've reached a stalemate. Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Room for Compromise:**  I've already made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **John is the Best Option:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.  It's time to secure the better deal and move on."
