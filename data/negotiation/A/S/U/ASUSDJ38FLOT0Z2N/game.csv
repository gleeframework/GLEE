"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to come down to $1,220,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer a final price of $1,260,000. This is my absolute minimum, and if you're unable to meet that, I'm going to have to explore other options. I truly believe this product is worth it to you, and I hope we can find a solution.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
