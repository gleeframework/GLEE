Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high starting point:** Knowing Bob's value is lower than yours and having a guaranteed backup offer allows you to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than John's offer. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  Mentioning ""listing it publicly"" and ""other interest"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the friendly tone and open-ended question (""What do you think?"") signal that you're open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the interaction positive and open to a deal."
