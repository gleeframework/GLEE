Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Close to Your Minimum:**  While we start high, we don't want to go too crazy. Offering it at $150 would likely scare Bob off immediately. $110 is still a significant profit margin for you.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""special price"" and ""great deal for the value,"" you create the impression that you're giving Bob a preferential opportunity.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving you a chance to secure a deal with Bob before moving on to John, your guaranteed sale."
