"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $780,000 is  below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $815,000. This price still provides me with a fair return and gives you a substantial value. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $815,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $805,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",805000.0,Bob,4,
