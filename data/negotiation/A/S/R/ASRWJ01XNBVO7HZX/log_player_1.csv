Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $780,000 is  below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $815,000. This price still provides me with a fair return and gives you a substantial value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 815000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $815,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $805,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $805,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $805,000 is a good price, and it's likely we won't get closer to my ideal number in the remaining rounds."
