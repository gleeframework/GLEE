"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, and it's right at the edge of my budget. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and the market demand. If you're still interested, this is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
