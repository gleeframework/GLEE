Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial offer already reflects a considerable discount on its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,275,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and sees the value.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk is acceptable. I believe we can push for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close to a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This is a firm offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer creates a sense of urgency while still leaving some room for negotiation if Bob is absolutely unwilling to budge. We're getting close to a point where the difference in potential profit might not outweigh the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,250,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000. While we could try to push for a bit more, it's getting risky. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit ($400,000) and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely. Holding out for a small potential gain isn't worth the risk of ending up with John's offer."
