"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11000 is a bit too low for me. How about $12500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11800 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $12200? Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12200.0,Alice,5,
