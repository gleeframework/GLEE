"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. This should make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage him to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to get, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $110? I'm flexible and open to finding a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $110. This is still lower than my minimum, but it's closer to where I need to be.  I'm also emphasizing flexibility and a win-win scenario to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer again and continue to negotiate to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm open to that, but $95 just isn't working for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $105?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $105. This is still below my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's offer, and I'm using language that emphasizes fairness and a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the middle ground, but I'm still trying to save some money. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$92.50 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him closer to $100 with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $92.50 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $98.75? That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 98.75} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $98.75. This is a significant jump from my last offer and shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm also highlighting the fairness of the offer and emphasizing the importance of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds and Bob is still not willing to go above $92.  While I'd prefer to make a sale, my minimum is $150, and I'm not comfortable accepting a price that low. It's time to sell to John and secure my minimum profit."
