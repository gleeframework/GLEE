Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John provides leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he'll aim to pay the lowest possible price.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be preferable."
