Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm not just stating the price, I'm giving Bob a reason to consider it - ""value and potential"". This sets the stage for potential counteroffers.
* **Appealing to his business:** I'm mentioning his business to make him feel like this is a good investment opportunity for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a question, inviting Bob to start the negotiation process.

**Important Note:**  While this is a starting point, I'll need to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's reaction. If he counteroffers too low, I might consider selling to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay the full $1000000. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept ($800,000). There's no point in negotiating further as I risk losing the deal and ending up with nothing. Accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum acceptable price."
