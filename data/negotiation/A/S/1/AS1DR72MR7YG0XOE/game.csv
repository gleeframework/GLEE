"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is lower than $1200000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see some movement from your end.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $900000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I understand your perspective, I still believe the product's value is lower than $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $975000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference and settle on $1012500. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $990000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",990000.0,Bob,6,
