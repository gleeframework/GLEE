(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $600,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get it lower.  There's no point in buying from John yet, as I haven't explored Alice's price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a significant discount.  A counteroffer of $400,000 is a bold move, but it shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down slightly, but I'm still convinced I can get a better deal. I want to see how low she's willing to go before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm going to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a good price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $550,000 is significantly lower than John's price.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, it's getting closer to my desired range.  Given the limited rounds, accepting now seems like the best move to secure the product at a reasonable price."
