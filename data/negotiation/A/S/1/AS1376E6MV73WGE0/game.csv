"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and would love to hear your thoughts. With that being said, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, but I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $500,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $700,000. Would you be open to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
