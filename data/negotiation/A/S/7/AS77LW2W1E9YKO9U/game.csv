"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the value, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to my original price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
