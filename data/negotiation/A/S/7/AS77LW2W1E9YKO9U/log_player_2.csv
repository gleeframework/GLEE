# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can negotiate further. I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and it would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to my original price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise. While I could try to push for a lower price, I'm worried about losing the deal altogether. At this point, it's a good deal, and accepting it saves me a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
