Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than your minimum desired price, but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate. If he accepts, you'll make $2,000 more than selling to John. If he rejects, you can still sell to John for $12,000. This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still maintaining a reasonable chance of getting the higher price."
