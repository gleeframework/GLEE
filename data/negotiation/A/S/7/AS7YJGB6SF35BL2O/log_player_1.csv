Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're making a profit of $1,500.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to negotiate since the product is worth more to him.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A higher price might make Bob immediately reject the offer. 

This strategy allows you to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
