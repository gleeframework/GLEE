"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to me is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that you'll consider it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
