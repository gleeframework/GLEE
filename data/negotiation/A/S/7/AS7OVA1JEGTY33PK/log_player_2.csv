"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and I want to try to secure a better price. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to me is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still above my target price. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is close to my counteroffer of $900,000.  While I would prefer to pay less,  it's getting close to the point where it might be better to buy from John for $1,200,000.  There's a good chance Alice will reject my next counteroffer, so accepting this offer is the most prudent decision."
