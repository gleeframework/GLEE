Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that you'll consider it.
