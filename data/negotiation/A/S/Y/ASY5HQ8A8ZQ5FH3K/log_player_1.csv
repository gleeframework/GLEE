Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **My Minimum:** I need to get at least $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for me while still offering Bob a price lower than his perceived value. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 

By aiming high but leaving room for Bob to still feel like he's getting a good deal, I maximize my chances of securing the highest possible profit."
