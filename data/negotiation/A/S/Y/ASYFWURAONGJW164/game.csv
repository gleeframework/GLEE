"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested!",14000.0,Alice,5,
