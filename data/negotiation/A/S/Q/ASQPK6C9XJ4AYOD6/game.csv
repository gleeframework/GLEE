"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,075,000 is a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,075,000, so I'll offer $1,037,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1037500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,037,500 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable at this price. Let me know your thoughts.",1062500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $1,062,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,062,500, so I'll offer $1,031,250. Can you consider this price?",1031250.0,Bob,6,
