"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you as well.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find some middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $950,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to get a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This would give us both a very good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to go with John's offer if we can't reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
