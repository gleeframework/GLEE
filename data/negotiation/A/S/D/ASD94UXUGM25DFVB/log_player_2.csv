"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My starting price is $14,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He's aiming for a price of $12,000 or less, and $14,000 is too high. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's still aiming for a price of $12,000 or less, and $13,500 is too high.  He can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $13,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
