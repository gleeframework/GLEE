"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $13,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
