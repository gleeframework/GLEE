"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,300,000) to set a strong anchor.  This is significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving me room to negotiate down. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth this much to Bob, it hints at unique features and potential to pique his interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that this is a starting point, implying willingness to negotiate. 

The goal is to understand Bob's willingness to pay and negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my target. Bob's message indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer to signal that while I'm open to negotiation, I'm aiming higher. I'm confident I can get closer to $2,000,000 in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer takes into account the unique benefits you'll gain from owning this product."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $200,000 to show Bob I'm flexible and willing to meet him closer to his offer. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the high price, even with the concession.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps me comfortably above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, allowing room for further negotiation while still aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the slight reduction, but $2,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,950,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,950,000 is a very good offer, significantly exceeding my minimum price and representing a successful negotiation. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's suggestion of meeting halfway creates a sense of fairness and compromise, making it more palatable to accept.
* **Time Value:**  While I have more rounds, there's always a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a great price."
