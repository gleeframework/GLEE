Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even exceeding the $10,000 you estimate it's worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, the price John is willing to pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning that the product's value exceeds Bob's $10,000 estimation might encourage him to accept.

This strategy aims for the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
