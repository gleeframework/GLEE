"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1050000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $975000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to close a deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
