Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not quite there with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $962,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal at this price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one! Alice is clearly trying to squeeze as much profit as possible. However, at $962,500, you're still getting a decent discount compared to John's offer.  

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Time Pressure:** You're running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Alice. 
* **Potential Losses:** If you push further and Alice walks, you'll end up paying John's full price, losing out on potential savings. 

While you could try to haggle further, the risk of losing the deal and paying more in the end outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
