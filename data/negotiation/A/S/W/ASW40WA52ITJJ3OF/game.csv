"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a ways off from that number. Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not quite there with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $962,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal at this price.",962500.0,Alice,7,
