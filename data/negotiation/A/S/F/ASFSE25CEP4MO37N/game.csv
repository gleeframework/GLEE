"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and it's still within my acceptable range. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9200.0,Bob,6,
