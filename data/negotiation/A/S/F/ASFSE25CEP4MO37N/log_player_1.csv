{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to you emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** $12,000 is a significant profit for you, considering your minimum value is $15,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, ensuring a more dynamic negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  Keeping John's offer in mind, you can always walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and ensuring the negotiation process remains open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value ($15,000). Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Proceed to Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially closing the gap and securing a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate but also maintain your desired price point.
* **John's Offer:** You still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

This strategy keeps the negotiation alive while protecting your interests and ensuring a higher potential profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a midpoint between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes your willingness to compromise, showing flexibility to Bob. 
* **Fairness:**  The counteroffer presents a ""fair"" price, making it more likely to be accepted.

* **Negotiation Pace:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the likelihood of reaching a deal.
* **John's Offer:** You remain prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob does not accept this counteroffer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer would be detrimental to your financial goals.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you demonstrate your commitment to a fair price and your ability to walk away. This strengthens your position for future counteroffers.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  Bob's offer of $9,200 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss, and there is little room for negotiation at this point.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures you get your minimum desired price and avoid a potentially unfavorable deal with Bob.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further price reductions, wasting valuable time and potentially ending in a deal that is significantly less profitable.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John provides a certain and profitable outcome, eliminating the risk of further negotiation failures with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This strategy prioritizes a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob. While it's always desirable to secure the highest possible price, sometimes it's more beneficial to accept a reliable offer and move on."
