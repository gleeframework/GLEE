Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly tone, highlighting the value the product holds for Bob. I also emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to:

* **Open negotiations:**  By setting a price close to Bob's value, it increases the likelihood of him engaging in negotiations.
* **Maximise potential gain:** Starting higher allows for some wiggle room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Secure a quick deal:**  By offering a reasonable price, I aim to avoid lengthy negotiations and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. Based on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value ($1,200,000), and I'm not willing to risk a lower profit just yet.

**Why reject?**

* **Higher potential profit:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about getting my desired price. This might motivate him to increase his offer in the next round.
* **Limited risk:**  I have the backup option of selling to John if negotiations fail, which ensures I don't lose out completely.

**Next steps:**

I will prepare a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I will also consider the factors that might be influencing Bob's offer (e.g., budget constraints, urgency) to tailor my counteroffer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,050,000.  The product's value is significant, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return on your investment. To show you I'm willing to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This compromise allows us to both achieve a favorable outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my desired profit margin.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize the product's value and potential ROI. I also reiterate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer aims to reach a middle ground, encouraging Bob to consider a price closer to my minimum.
* **Showing flexibility:** It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not offering a price significantly lower than my minimum, so I still hold some leverage in the negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll consider making a final offer or opting to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between respecting the product's value and staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise my financial goals.  

**Why sell to John?**

* **Guaranteed minimum:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired price, guaranteeing a profit. 
* **No further risk:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of further rejection, which could lead to a lower price or a longer negotiation process.
* **Time and effort:**  Selling to John saves me time and effort by eliminating further negotiation rounds.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, selling to John is the most sensible decision from a financial perspective. This ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids the potential risks and delays of further negotiations."
