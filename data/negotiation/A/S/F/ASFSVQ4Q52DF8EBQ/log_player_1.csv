Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit.  I believe Bob is likely to counter-offer, and we can then work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a large loss. I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $850,000.  This is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to Bob and my own need to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob for a higher price, Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  To ensure a profit and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000."
