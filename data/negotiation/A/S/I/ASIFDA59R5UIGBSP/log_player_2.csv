"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. It's a great price, considering its value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is significant. It shows Bob is serious about getting a good price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  A counteroffer of $10,000 is still well within Bob's budget and above Alice's value. 
* **Polite tone:**  Keeping a positive and professional tone is important for building rapport and increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11500. It's still a great price, considering its value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice's offer of $11,500 is only $500 away from Bob's counteroffer, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable deal:** While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting the offer saves him $3,500 compared to buying from John and still leaves him with a profit.
* **Time pressure:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
