Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum:** I'm asking for more than my minimum of $12,000, so I'm already making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It shows I'm flexible:**  I'm not starting at the highest possible price, which could make Bob less likely to negotiate. 

If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer based on his response and continue negotiating until I reach a mutually beneficial agreement or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than John's offer, I'm not ready to accept just yet.  Here's why:

* **I'm still aiming higher:**  I believe the product is worth more than $13,000, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price that is closer to my ideal outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob might walk away, but I also have the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $13,500?  This price is fair for both of us, and I believe you'll still find the product to be a great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's in between our initial offers. This shows that I'm open to negotiating.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a reason to accept by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 

This counteroffer allows me to increase the price without being too aggressive, and hopefully, it will convince Bob to accept the deal."
