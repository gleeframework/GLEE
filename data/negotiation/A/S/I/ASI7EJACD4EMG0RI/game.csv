"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $13,500?  This price is fair for both of us, and I believe you'll still find the product to be a great value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
