"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me ($150).  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $145?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer, but $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $140. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting increasingly tedious, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum threshold of $150. To avoid further haggling and ensure a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
