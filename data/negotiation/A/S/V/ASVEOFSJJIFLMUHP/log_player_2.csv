"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product ($1,000,000). This means there's room for negotiation and potentially a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's a good starting point for negotiation and allows you to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above her own value of $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $1,050,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,300,000. It's still below Alice's value, but it shows a willingness to meet her halfway. This might encourage her to accept, especially since you're already showing flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,500,000. At this point, the negotiation is becoming too time-consuming and potentially risky. You might not be able to get a lower price from Alice, and you're running the risk of her rejecting your counteroffers.  It's more efficient to go with John's offer, as it guarantees you the product within your budget."
