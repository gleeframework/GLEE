"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a lower price than its value to you and I'll get a good price for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000? That seems like a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $10,500. This is a fair price that considers your interest and my need for a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a reasonable profit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and keeps us moving towards a deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
