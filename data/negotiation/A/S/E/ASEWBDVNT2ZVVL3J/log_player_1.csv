Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  My starting offer is $1,450,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,450,000, which is a good starting point considering my minimum is $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation but still indicates the product's value.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes a win-win scenario and highlights the value Bob would receive from the product.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message clearly states my willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility.

This initial offer is designed to set a high baseline while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can continue negotiating based on his counteroffer or move on to John if I feel a satisfactory price is unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1300000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is above Bob's perceived value of the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a backup offer from John for a higher price. Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my bargaining position and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our conversation,  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This would still give you a significant value for the product while ensuring I can reach my target price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer but still leaves a margin for potential negotiation. 
* **Re-emphasizing value:** The message highlights the significant value Bob would still receive at $1,400,000. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** The message clearly indicates my minimum acceptable price, signaling that I'm not willing to go lower than $1,400,000.

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise while maintaining a solid bargaining position. It allows for a possible agreement while keeping the option to move to John if a deal with Bob can't be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My counteroffer is $1250000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest counteroffer of $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made a considerable concession by coming down to $1,400,000.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a deal that meets my minimum requirements. 

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John and secure the desired value.  This avoids further negotiation with Bob and ensures I get the best possible outcome for myself."
