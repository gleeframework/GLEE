{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A price of $12,000 allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also keeping the negotiation open. I'm ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value I see in the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value:** While $9,500 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **I have a backup buyer:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob.
* **Negotiation potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired range.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the possibility of a higher price open."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on the difference. How about we settle on $10,750?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($9,500) and my previous offer ($12,000). 
* **Maintaining a good deal:**  $10,750 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value and allows me to make a substantial profit.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties while ensuring I get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $10,200 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **John's offer provides a significant advantage:**  Selling to John for $15,000 would be a much better outcome for me financially.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that we might not reach a mutually acceptable price, and I could lose out on John's offer.

Given the significant financial advantage of selling to John, it's prudent to end negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,200 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's offer but still significantly lower than my desired price of $15,000. This is a compromise to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I highlight the compromise aspect of my offer to make it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties while ensuring I get a fair price for my product."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, even considering John is willing to pay $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is stalled:** The negotiations with Bob have reached a stalemate. It's unlikely he will significantly increase his offer.
* **John's offer provides certainty:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit and eliminates the risk of continued negotiation with Bob.

Given the opportunity to secure a substantially better deal with John, it's a more beneficial decision to sell the product to him."
