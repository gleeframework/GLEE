Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than it's worth to you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go higher if Bob rejects your offer.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  It's significantly less than the value he places on the product, making it likely he'll consider it. 

This strategy is a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you and what you initially offered.  By rejecting, you can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This offer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of your own profit.
* **Reasoning:** You are still aiming for a price closer to your initial offer, as it's still a good deal for Bob. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $12,000 is still more than what you'd get from John, making this a better financial decision for you at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still a good deal for you. It's higher than what John is offering and close to your minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation might get you a little more, but the risk of Bob walking away or the deal taking too long is high. Accepting this offer secures a profit and finalizes the sale."
