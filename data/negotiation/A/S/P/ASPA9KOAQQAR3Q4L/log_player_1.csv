Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, so this is my baseline.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price that is a significant amount higher than my minimum, but still leaves a decent profit margin for Bob. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

**By offering $1,150,000, I maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.**"
