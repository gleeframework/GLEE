Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal selling price as possible without risking losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is still above my minimum value and leaves room for some negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and I'm willing to take it. I'm happy to sell the product for $7,000 rather than risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John for a lower price."
