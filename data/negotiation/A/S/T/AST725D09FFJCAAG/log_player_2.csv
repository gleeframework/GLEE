"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. While $1,150,000 is a better deal than buying from John, Bob can likely get a lower price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering its value. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might get the price down a bit more, but it's likely not worth the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially escalating the price.  It's time to secure the deal."
