Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** While $8,000 is Bob's valuation, he might be willing to pay more if he believes it's a good deal.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 allows you to push for a higher price with Bob. 

By starting high, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell to John without any loss."
