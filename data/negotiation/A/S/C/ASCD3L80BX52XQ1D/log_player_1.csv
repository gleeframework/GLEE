Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  Bob is willing to pay $80, so $100 is a good price for him.
* **It's lower than my minimum:** I value the product at $120, so selling it for $100 is still a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, so I haven't closed the door to a better deal."
