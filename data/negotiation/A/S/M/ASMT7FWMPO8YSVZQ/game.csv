"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal, but I'm running out of room to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go.
