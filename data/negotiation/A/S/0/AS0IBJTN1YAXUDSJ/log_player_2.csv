"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll end up having to buy from John for $1,500,000.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a price within my budget."
