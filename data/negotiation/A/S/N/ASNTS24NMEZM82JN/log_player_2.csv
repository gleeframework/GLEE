"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob.  He has a significant margin for negotiation and can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still get a better deal.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price down even lower.  He's still a long way from John's price, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value of this product, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for it. This price is closer to my initial assessment of its worth, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, he's getting close to his desired price range and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might decide to walk away or Bob might end up buying from John for a higher price.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible move at this point."
