Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $1,600,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. We are getting into the later rounds, but I'm willing to leverage my alternative option with John if necessary.  I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $1.7 million in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is my final offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about the price and won't go much lower. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds,  putting slight time pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative:** I still have John as a backup, allowing me to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet my needs."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,650,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough decision point. Let's analyze:

* **Bob's latest offer:** $1,650,000 is a decent amount over my minimum, but significantly less than I aimed for. 
* **Rounds remaining:** Only two rounds left, increasing the risk of Bob holding out for an even lower price.
* **John's offer:** My fallback of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option.

While I could try to push Bob a little further, there's a real chance he won't budge much, and I'd risk losing $150,000. 

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with a lower amount or having to settle for John's offer at the last minute."
