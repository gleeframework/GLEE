"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
