Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that will benefit both of us. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.

Bob seems firmly anchored at $800,000 and unwilling to budge significantly. While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Accepting John's offer ensures a clean and immediate transaction at a favorable price."
