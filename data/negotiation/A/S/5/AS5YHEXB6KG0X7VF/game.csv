"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, given my budget constraints.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you, and I appreciate your flexibility.  $925,000 is closer to my range, but it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,7,
