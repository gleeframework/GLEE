Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think a price of $95 is fair, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $95 creates a sense of urgency (""before I list it publicly"") and positions it as a potential deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $95 is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, still netting me more than $80.

By starting high but reasonable, I increase my chances of selling the product quickly and for a price that benefits me most."
