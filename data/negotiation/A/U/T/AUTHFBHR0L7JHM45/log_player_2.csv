"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think a price of $95 is fair, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than the public price, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
