Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $150.
* **John's Offer:** John guarantees you $150 if Bob refuses.

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you don't want to go below that price. However, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly more than his valuation. Offering it at $140 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get a good price even if Bob declines."
