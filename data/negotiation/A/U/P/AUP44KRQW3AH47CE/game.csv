"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? That's the highest I can go.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $92 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $94? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I can do $91, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",91.0,Bob,6,
