"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $100 to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```
I'm offering a compromise price of $95, which is closer to my minimum value and also closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, and hopefully, it will lead to a quicker deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $92 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $92 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $94? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

I'm offering a price of $94, which is again a compromise and closer to my desired value. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I can do $91, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Although Bob's offer of $91 is closer to my minimum than my previous counteroffer, we've been negotiating for a while now, and I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that satisfies both of us.  Selling to John will give me a guaranteed price that is within my acceptable range."
