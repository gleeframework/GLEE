Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, Start Strong:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to aim higher with Bob. Starting with a price well above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) creates room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency,  potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price than he would otherwise.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. This opens the door to finding a price that works for both of you, ideally somewhere between $800,000 and $1,300,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves some risk. There's a chance Bob might be completely turned off by the high initial price and walk away. However, with your guaranteed sale to John, you're not losing out completely."
