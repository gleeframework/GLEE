Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're making a profit of $4,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counteroffer, but you still have room to negotiate up to his perceived value of $15,000.
* **It's aggressive but not unreasonable:** This price shows you're serious about getting a good deal while still leaving space for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is above your minimum, you can likely get closer to your target price of $12,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Bob you're committed to getting a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a significant value for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. While it's not your ideal price, it's still a decent profit ($2,200) and closer to your goal.  Continuing to negotiate might take longer and could risk Bob walking away entirely. Accepting his offer allows you to secure the deal and move on."
