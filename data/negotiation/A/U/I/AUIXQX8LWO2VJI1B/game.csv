"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
