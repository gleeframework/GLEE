Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $130 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply he might miss out if he doesn't act. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than your fallback option (John at $100)."
