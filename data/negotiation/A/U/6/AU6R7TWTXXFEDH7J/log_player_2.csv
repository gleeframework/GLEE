"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  I know this is a significant purchase, so please feel free to consider the offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering the product for $9,500. While this is a good deal, you can do even better.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you can buy from John for $10,000, which is still within your budget."
