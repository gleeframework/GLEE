"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my original offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $11,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
