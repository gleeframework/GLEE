"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks great, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,125,000, so I'm counteroffering at $1,237,500. What do you think?",1237500.0,Alice,5,
