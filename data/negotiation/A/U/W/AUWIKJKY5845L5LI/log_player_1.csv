"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's still close enough to my minimum price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer.  There's also the risk that I'll run out of rounds and be forced to sell to John for the same price. It's best to secure the deal now."
