"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $987,500. This offer acknowledges the value you've placed on the product while remaining within my budget. I believe it's a fair compromise.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's try to find a solution quickly. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1010000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,010,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to go up to $995,000.  This represents a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's finalize this and avoid further delays.",995000.0,Bob,6,
