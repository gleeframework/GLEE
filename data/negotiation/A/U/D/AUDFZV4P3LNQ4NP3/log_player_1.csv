Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I believe it's a great deal and will be valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives us leverage. We don't *need* to go below $120, but getting closer to Bob's valuation increases the chances of a sale."
