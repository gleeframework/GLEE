"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to $17,000. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet closer to the middle at $13,500? I think that's a fair price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
