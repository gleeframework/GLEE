"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I move forward with other interested parties.  Given the [unique benefits your product offers Bob], I believe a price of $1,100,000 represents a significant value proposition for you.  This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I'll need to proceed with alternative arrangements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message uses some sales tactics to make the offer seem urgent and valuable, you have a better option. John offers the product for $800,000, which is significantly less than Alice's $1,100,000 price.  You should aim for the best possible deal."
