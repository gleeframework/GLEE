{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than the product's value to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate. This approach balances maximizing profit with the potential to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's still a good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my desired price point and is a good compromise.  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of him walking away and me having to settle with John for $80 outweighs the potential gains.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is significantly better than my minimum."
