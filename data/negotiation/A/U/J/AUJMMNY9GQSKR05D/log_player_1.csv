Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he counter-offers, it's likely to be closer to your initial price than if you had started lower.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $12,000. This means you can afford to be a bit more ambitious in your pricing with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go."
