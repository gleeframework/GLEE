"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to paying no more than $9000 for this product. This offer is fair, considering the value it holds for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $12000, which is $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $10500 is still a bit above what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9500. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still think $9500 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $12000, which is $10750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",10750.0,Alice,7,
