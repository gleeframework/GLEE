"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I want to anchor the negotiation lower than my actual top price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Polite but Firm:**  My message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states my position.
* **Significant Difference:**  The counteroffer is substantially lower, which might encourage Alice to re-evaluate her own position and potentially offer a more significant price reduction in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her counteroffer of $14,000 shows movement. However, I can still try to push for a slightly better deal before accepting. Buying from John is now a less appealing option since Alice's offer is getting closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $13,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down to $14,000, and my previous offer was $12,000.  Meeting in the middle at $13,000 seems like a reasonable compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Direct and Clear:** My message is concise and clearly states my desired price.
* **Sense of Finality (but open to negotiation):**  While I aim to finalize the deal at $13,000, the wording leaves room for a final counteroffer from Alice if needed."
