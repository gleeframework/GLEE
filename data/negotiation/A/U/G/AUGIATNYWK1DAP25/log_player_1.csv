Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. Here's why I chose this price and the reasoning behind the message:

* **$20,000:**  It's higher than my minimum value of $15,000, giving me room for negotiation. I'm hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Negotiation:** Explicitly mentioning ""open to negotiation""  indicates flexibility, which can make Bob more inclined to engage. 
* **Value proposition:** Highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" and ""valuable asset""  makes the product sound appealing. 
* **Open-ended:** Ending with ""Let me know if you're interested"" keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to respond. 

This approach balances the need to get a good price with the need to keep Bob interested in the deal."
