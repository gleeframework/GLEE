"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario, as you'll be getting a great deal, and I'll be able to secure a significant portion of the product's worth. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $950,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my financial capacity.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but unfortunately, $950,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least cover a significant portion of the product's worth. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a reasonable compromise.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I must respectfully decline. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,050,000. I am still committed to finding a solution within my budget. Therefore, I would like to propose purchasing the product for $1,000,000. I hope this revised offer meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
