"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product but I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle on $95?  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, so I'll sell the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,5,
