Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $15,000 if Bob refuses.

Therefore, Alice should start with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation but lower than John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer while ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a profitable sale."
