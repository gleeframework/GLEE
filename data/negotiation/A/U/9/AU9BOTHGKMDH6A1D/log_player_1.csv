**Reasoning:** Bob seems fixated on $1,200,000 and unlikely to budge significantly.  Continuing the negotiation risks a lower final offer from him. Accepting his current offer means a $200,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's strategically wiser to cut losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
