"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount for Bob but still leaves me with a decent profit.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I still believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $90. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $82.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping Bob will come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87.5}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $87.5. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer but I still want to make sure I earn a profit. Hopefully, we can close the deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough one.  While I'd like to get a little more than $80, I'm running out of rounds. If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with nothing. It's best to take the sure thing and sell to John."
