Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Secure the Sale:**  While we have John as backup, selling to Bob directly is preferable to ensure a smoother and potentially faster transaction."
