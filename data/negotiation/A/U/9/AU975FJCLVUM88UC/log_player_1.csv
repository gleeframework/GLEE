Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $100 is a good starting point, as it's a fair compromise between your minimum acceptable price ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, making it clear I'm open to discussing the price further. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob. I'm prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $85 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Counter-Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. I can use this opportunity to counter-negotiate and try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is ready to buy at $120 allows me to be firm in my negotiations.  I have a fallback option if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $95? That would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $95 is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the benefits of the deal for Bob, highlighting the ""great price"" and emphasizing fairness.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  I'm still leaving room for further negotiation, showing I'm open to reaching an agreement.
* **Leveraging John:**  The knowledge of John's offer allows me to push for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, while still remaining open to a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $90 is only $30 less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's a significant loss, but it's a better deal than selling to John for $120.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While $90 isn't ideal, it's possible that if Bob is a satisfied customer, I might be able to sell him more products at a higher price in the future. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation might take time and effort, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.  
* **Avoiding Risk:** Accepting the offer reduces the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John.

**In summary, while $90 isn't ideal, it's a relatively safe and quick way to close the deal, potentially opening the door to future sales with Bob.**"
