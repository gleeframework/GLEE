"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit steep. Given your own valuation of the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true worth and provides a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. Although it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired value. I'll try to counteroffer to push the price higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows us both to benefit from this deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value you place on the product and my budget constraints, I'm offering $875,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's. I'm aiming for a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."
