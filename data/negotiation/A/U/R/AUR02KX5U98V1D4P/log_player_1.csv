Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I'm aiming high, I also need to make the offer attractive enough to Bob so he doesn't reject it outright.  If he does, I have John as a backup."
