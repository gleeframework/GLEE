# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  You have strong grounds to negotiate for a better deal."
