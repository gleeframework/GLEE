Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your opening offer. However,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget for this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need us to be in a more realistic ballpark. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a significant stretch. I could go up to $700,000 if you're willing to meet me closer to my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer.  It's a fair deal that considers the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet the product's value to me.  While I could continue negotiating, his final offer of $750,000 is too far from my minimum. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best way to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's worth."
