"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not outrageously so. This will give me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to be more competitive while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price and it's likely that we won't get much closer in the remaining rounds.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and reduces the risk of losing the deal."
