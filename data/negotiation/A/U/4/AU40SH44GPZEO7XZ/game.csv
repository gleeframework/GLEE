"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be a great asset to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true market value and the value it would bring to your business.  To find a middle ground, I could consider $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm serious about purchasing this, but it needs to make financial sense. How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This demonstrates my commitment while acknowledging the product's value.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution.  I understand your position and am willing to be flexible to make this deal happen. How about $1,300,000? This represents a significant compromise from my original ask and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I still need you to move a bit more on the price. To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find common ground soon.  Would you consider $1,150,000? This reflects the urgency I have to acquire this while respecting your bottom line.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
