"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. I would like to propose a deal where you can purchase this exceptional item for $140. This price not only reflects its high quality but also ensures a reasonable profit for me. I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $140 is still above your maximum budget of $150. 
* You know John will sell it to you for $150. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply buy from John."
