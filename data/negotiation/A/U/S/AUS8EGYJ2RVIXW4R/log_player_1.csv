"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he's not, I can always come down in subsequent rounds. I also want to leave some room for negotiation, as I don't want to immediately push him to the John deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and is well above my minimum value. This should hopefully show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to sell at his current price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not acceptable.  I'm going to continue negotiating. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge a bit more, but if not, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $15,000 might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and shows flexibility. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to meet him halfway, and this will lead to a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is only $1,000 below John's offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'll try to counteroffer to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $14,500. This is still less than John's offer, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal with him. It's a small increase from his last offer, and I'm hoping that he'll see it as a sign of good faith and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're now at round 8, and Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I've been trying to find a compromise, I'm running out of time.  It's getting too risky to continue negotiating with Bob, as I only have two rounds left.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
