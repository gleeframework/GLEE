"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly below its true market value. While I value it at over $1.5 million, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial saving for you and a chance to acquire a valuable asset.  Consider this a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay full price.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
