"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1200000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a great opportunity to own a unique product at a price that's still a great value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1200000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
