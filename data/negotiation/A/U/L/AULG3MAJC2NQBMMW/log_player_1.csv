Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable.  Given its unique nature and your specific interest, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, aiming to justify a premium price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, you can still go down while staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some reason to believe Bob might be willing to pay a premium (e.g., the product is more valuable to him than other potential buyers, he has a strong need for it, or you've cultivated a relationship where he trusts your judgment)."
