"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a significant savings. Let's try to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $9,200 for the product. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product and the savings you'll be getting.  It's also the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",9200.0,Alice,5,
