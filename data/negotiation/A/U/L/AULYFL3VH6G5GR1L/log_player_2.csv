"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a fantastic deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,350,000 is a good price for him, saving him $150,000 compared to John's price. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he'll be left with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
