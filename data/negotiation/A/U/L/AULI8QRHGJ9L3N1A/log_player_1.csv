Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer.
* **It's a good first offer:** This shows that you're willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to meet him halfway, it would still leave you with a significant loss.  It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $9,500 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is still below your ideal price, it's very close to your minimum. It's important to weigh your options. 

* **Selling to John:**  This guarantees you $12,000, but you would forgo potentially getting more from Bob.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** This risks a prolonged negotiation and the possibility of Bob getting frustrated and walking away.

Given that Bob is already at $10,250, it's likely he won't budge much further.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
