"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $130, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $130 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm prepared to go to $110. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $125.",125.0,Alice,5,
