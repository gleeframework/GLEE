# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe its value could be significantly higher for the right buyer. I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its potential.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this and won't regret this investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
