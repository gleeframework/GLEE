"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and what I've researched about the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is tempting, it's a bit below what I can accept at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This price still reflects the value the product brings to your business, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950,000? I think this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the value this product offers.  Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This price acknowledges your needs and still allows me to receive a fair return on my investment. This product has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident that this price will be a good investment for you in the long run.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I think the product will bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,6,
