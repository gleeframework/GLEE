Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is tempting, it's a bit below what I can accept at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This price still reflects the value the product brings to your business, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.
