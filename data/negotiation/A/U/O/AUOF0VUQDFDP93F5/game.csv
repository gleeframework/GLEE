"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price reflects the significant value the product brings to you, while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $925000 again, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",925000.0,Bob,6,
