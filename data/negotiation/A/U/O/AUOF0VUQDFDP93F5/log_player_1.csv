Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $925,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still holding out for something more.  I'm confident I can get him to come up a bit more, especially as he's already expressed a willingness to negotiate.  There's still value for him in this product, and I'm not giving up yet!"

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $1,000,000,  $925,000 is a good deal considering we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's also more than what I'd get from John, so it's a win for me."
