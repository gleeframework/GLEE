"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in your product, $100 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to make a proposal that might better suit your needs. How about we consider the product priced at $90? This still offers you a good deal while allowing me to cover my costs. I hope this suggestion works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
