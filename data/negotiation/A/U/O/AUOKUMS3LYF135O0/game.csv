"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. My initial offer is $1,150,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1,075,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for it.  Let's meet at $1,100,000. This price still gives you a significant discount while allowing me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,090,000.  I believe this is a competitive offer that reflects the value of the product.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,090,000 is still below the value I need to achieve.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,105,000.  This represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1105000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're close! I'm ready to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,097,500?  That's my final offer.",1097500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's seal this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,7,
