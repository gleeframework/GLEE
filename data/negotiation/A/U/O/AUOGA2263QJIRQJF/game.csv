"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,192,500?",1192500.0,Bob,6,
