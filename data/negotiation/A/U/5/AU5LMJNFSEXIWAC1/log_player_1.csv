This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves some room for compromise.  It also opens the communication by acknowledging Bob's perspective, making him more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a bit more. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
