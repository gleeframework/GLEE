"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  You can get the product for $125 from Alice, which is cheaper than the $150 you'd pay John.
* **Your goal is to save money:** Even though Alice's offer is more than the product's worth to her ($100), it's still the best deal for you."
