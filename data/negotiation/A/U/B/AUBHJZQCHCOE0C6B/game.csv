"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a very generous offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it, seeing as it's worth $8,000 to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the compromise, $14,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
