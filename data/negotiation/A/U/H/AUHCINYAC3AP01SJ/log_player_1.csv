"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive message:** I'm starting with a friendly tone, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer, which is important for a successful negotiation. 

This approach aims to start a negotiation while establishing a clear upper limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I'm confident I can get a better price. Bob's counteroffer shows his interest in the product.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I know John is a guaranteed $100, but I'm hoping for a better deal with Bob.

I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counter-offer (splitting the difference) and highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and focused on finding a mutually agreeable solution.

This counter-offer aims to find a compromise while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $92 is still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We're getting closer to a deal, and I believe I can get a slightly better price with one more counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I'm still holding onto the option of selling to John for $100, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob.

I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a final compromise that's closer to my preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $94, as a final offer.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final counteroffer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm justifying my price by emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of the offer for both of us.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm still maintaining a friendly tone, highlighting the positive aspects of the deal for Bob.

This counter-offer aims to close the deal by offering a final compromise that is closer to my preferred price while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $88 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation has stalled:** Bob's persistence on a low price suggests we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John at $100 ensures I meet my minimum requirement and avoids further negotiation.

While I'd like to get a better deal with Bob, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price than John's offer isn't worth it. I'll accept John's offer to secure a sale that meets my minimum profit margin."
