"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I understand it might seem quite an investment. However, considering its true worth and the unique opportunity it presents, I am offering you the chance to acquire it for $9,500. This price reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my earnings and ensuring you receive a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is too close to your maximum budget of $10,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. If Alice is unwilling to budge, you still have the option to buy from John for $10,000, ensuring you get the product."
