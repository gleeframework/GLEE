"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? This would still be a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I see we're getting closer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $125.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,5,
