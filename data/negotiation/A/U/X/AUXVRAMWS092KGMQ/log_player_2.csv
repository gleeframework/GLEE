* **Testing Alice's limits:** This offer pushes the boundaries, forcing Alice to decide if she's willing to lose the deal or accept a lower price.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** This offer is still within your budget, but it's a gamble. If Alice rejects it, you'll have to decide if John's offer is a better alternative.
