"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a clear bargaining position and sets a low baseline for the negotiation. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it's important to establish a range for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,450,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a concession. My goal is to find a price where both of us feel we're getting a fair deal.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is enticing enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to pay more than $1,500,000 at this point.  I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going all in with my final counteroffer.  $1,500,000 is my absolute limit, and I believe Alice is likely to accept this offer. She's already come down significantly from her initial price, and she knows that I can walk away and buy from John at this price. If she rejects, I'll be forced to buy from John, which is still a good deal for me, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Alice and save some time."
