"Alice, thank you for the offer! I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your best offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
