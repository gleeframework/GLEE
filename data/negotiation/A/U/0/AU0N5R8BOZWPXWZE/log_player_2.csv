"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm confident that you'll appreciate its worth, but I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen. I'm offering the product to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price with anyone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.
