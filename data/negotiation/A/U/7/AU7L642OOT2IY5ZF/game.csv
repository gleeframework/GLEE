"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for this product, given its value to me. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is significantly below its true market value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, which is a significant compromise. I'm confident this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. How about we settle at $1,925,000?  This is my final offer.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,925,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $1,875,000, which is a fair price given our previous discussions. I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.",1875000.0,Bob,6,
