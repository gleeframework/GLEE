"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $13,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
