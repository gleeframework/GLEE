{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's initial offer is very close to your maximum budget, it's still a dollar more than you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before committing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob. However, I've given it some thought and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer is at your maximum budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price.  Since John is offering the product at your maximum price, it's safer to secure the deal with him and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
