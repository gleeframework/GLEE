"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure a deal that's closer to the value I see in this product. I'm prepared to offer you $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you value the product highly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
