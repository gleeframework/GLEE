"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further. There's a lot of room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure a deal that's closer to the value I see in this product. I'm prepared to offer you $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,200,000 is a significant increase from Alice's offer, but it's still well below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Fair and Balanced:** This offer shows Bob is serious about the deal but is also not willing to overpay. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is polite and focused on finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you value the product highly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, it's still significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's worth testing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise from Bob's previous counteroffer, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway.
* **Fair Price:**  $1,050,000 is still a good profit for Alice considering her valuation of $1,000,000.
* **Finality:**  The message suggests a desire to close the deal, but it leaves room for a final counteroffer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $1,075,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and further negotiation may not yield a better price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If Bob rejects, Alice may walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price.  

This offer represents a good balance between saving money and ensuring Bob secures the product."
