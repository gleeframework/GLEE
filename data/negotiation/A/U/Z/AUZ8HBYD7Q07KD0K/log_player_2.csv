"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which I think is a fair compromise given its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high.  It's much closer to her valuation than mine. I'll make a counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product is useful to me, but not essential, so I need to make sure the price is right for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $900,000 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to nudge her closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $750,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $950,000. It's a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems like Alice is stuck around the $900,000 mark and unwilling to go much lower. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John's offer of $800,000 is the better deal at this point."
