"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which I think is a fair compromise given its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product is useful to me, but not essential, so I need to make sure the price is right for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $750,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $950,000. It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
