"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its exceptional nature."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially offering"" subtly signals our willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Low:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We are only in Round 2 of 10. There is ample time to negotiate a better deal with Bob.
* **John as a Backup:** We have the security of John's offer, providing a strong fallback position.

We will aim to counter at a price closer to our target while still allowing room for further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We are lowering our price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Bob's Offer:** The counteroffer remains significantly above Bob's proposed $900,000, reinforcing the value we place on the product.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** We are still aiming for a price closer to our target of $1,200,000.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct, stating our position and proposed compromise clearly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's statement about a ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure us into accepting. 
* **Significant Gap Remains:**  $950,000 is still substantially below our $1,200,000 walk-away point. 
* **Time for Leverage:**  We are not even halfway through the negotiation rounds. We have time to apply more pressure.

We will reject his offer, but signal that we are getting closer to considering John's offer to increase pressure on Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, that price point doesn't reflect the value this product represents. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for the full asking price.  I'd prefer to work with you, so I'm willing to consider $1,000,000.  But I need you to understand this is my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  We are letting Bob know we have another offer for our full asking price. This creates a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Slight Concession:** We are moving slightly closer to Bob's price, but only by a small amount. This shows we are willing to negotiate but holding firm on our valuation.
* **""Absolute Limit"":** By framing this as our final offer, we are increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  Even while applying pressure, we want to keep the communication positive and emphasize our preference to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to consider $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is my absolute limit. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern of Small Increases:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer in small increments. This suggests he has more room to negotiate and is testing our resolve.
* **""Absolute Limit"" Counter:**  Just like us, Bob is using the ""absolute limit"" tactic. It's likely not his true limit.
* **Profit Margin Still Significant:** The difference between his offer ($980,000) and John's offer ($1,200,000) is still very substantial.

We will reject this offer but need to start considering our strategy for the remaining rounds.  We can't keep rejecting without risking Bob walking away."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, and I want to be fair. However, accepting your current offer would mean a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal today.  Let's agree on $995,000, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 995000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  By stating this is our ""final concession,"" we signal that we are serious about closing the deal but won't go any lower. 
* **Small Concession, Big Impact:** A $5,000 difference might seem insignificant compared to the overall price, but it can be psychologically impactful and appear like a major concession.
* **""Walk Away Happy"":** We are ending on a positive note, emphasizing mutual benefit and a desire to reach a win-win agreement.

**Important Considerations for Future Rounds:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Pay close attention to Bob's reaction to this offer. If he still hesitates, we may need to seriously consider taking John's offer soon.
* **Time Remaining:** We have four rounds left, so we need to decide on our final ""walk away"" price point if Bob doesn't meet our current offer.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  How much risk are we willing to take to try to get closer to $1,000,000? Each round brings the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're making a final concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $990,000 is only $10,000 less than our last counteroffer and a significant profit over his initial offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate for a small amount of additional profit increases the risk of Bob walking away completely.
* **Time is Valuable:** Each round spent negotiating is an opportunity cost. Accepting now allows us to move on to other deals.

While we could try to push for a bit more, it's unlikely that the potential gain outweighs the risks at this point. Accepting $990,000 secures a very good deal for us."
