{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a good profit, and this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's estimated value:**  This gives Bob a reason to accept, as he'll still be getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and confident offer:**  It shows that you're not desperate and are willing to negotiate, but you also have a strong stance.

This is just the first step, though. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can either lower your price slightly or even call John to see if he's still interested, to put pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product to me, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is still a good profit, it's a significant drop from your initial offer and leaves less room for further negotiation.  It's worth trying to get closer to your initial asking price.  You can either counteroffer or see if John is still interested as a way to put pressure on Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcome.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Splits the difference:** This shows Bob that you're willing to be flexible and meet him halfway.
* **Keeps the price relatively high:**  You're still aiming for a good profit and haven't dropped your price significantly.
* **Reinforces the value:** You remind Bob that this is a valuable product, making him more likely to accept. 

This counteroffer positions you well for the next round. If Bob rejects, you can either lower your price again slightly or gauge John's interest to put pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with $1325000. This price still allows me to save some money compared to my initial budget while being closer to your original offer. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  While $1,325,000 is slightly below the initial counteroffer, it's still a significant profit for you and a good compromise.  It's wise to accept this offer before Bob potentially drops his price further or you lose him entirely."
