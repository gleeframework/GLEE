Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $10,500? That leaves some room for both of us to make a profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
