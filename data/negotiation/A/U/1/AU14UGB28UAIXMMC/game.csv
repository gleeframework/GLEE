"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $10,500? That leaves some room for both of us to make a profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
