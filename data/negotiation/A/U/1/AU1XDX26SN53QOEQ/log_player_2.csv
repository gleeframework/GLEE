Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while not the absolute lowest price, getting the product for $8,200 is a decent saving compared to John's $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate might backfire."
