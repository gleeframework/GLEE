"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this reflects its true worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I need to see some flexibility from you to make this happen.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for lowering your price. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
