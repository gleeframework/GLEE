"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $100? It's my maximum, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in our price range. After considering our previous discussion, I would like to offer the product to you for $110. This price still reflects the value I place on the product while being mindful of your budget constraints.",110.0,Alice,3,
