{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to me, but still potentially attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to drop to $750,000.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $850,000. This is still a fair price for Bob, as the product is worth $800,000 to him.  This should give us some room to negotiate without losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'll make another counteroffer, as I'm hoping to get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to offer $825,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, but it's still within my minimum acceptable range. Hopefully, Bob will accept, as I'm not sure I can make a higher counteroffer without risking losing him to another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum return."
