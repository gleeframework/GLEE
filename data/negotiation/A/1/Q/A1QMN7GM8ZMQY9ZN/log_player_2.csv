"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, it's still above Bob's perceived value of the product.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a good price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but significantly lower than the $10,000 he could pay John.  This is a good deal for Bob, allowing him to save $1,000.  There's no guarantee he can negotiate further and get a lower price, so it's wise to accept this offer."
