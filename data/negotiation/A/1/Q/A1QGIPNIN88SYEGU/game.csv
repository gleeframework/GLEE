,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $130 is a bit out of my budget. How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you being flexible.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it immediately.",120.0,Bob,4,
