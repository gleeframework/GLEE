Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, and also shows that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $130 is a bit out of my budget. How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is close to my minimum, I'm willing to try to get a bit closer to my target price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you being flexible.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's a fair price, and I don't want to risk him backing out entirely.  It's better to accept his offer and sell the product rather than continue negotiating or selling to John for the same price."
