"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to my budget while leaving room for further negotiation. It's important to be polite and express appreciation for Alice's offer even while trying to negotiate a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, we're still closer to her initial price than John's offer. Let's try negotiating one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97.50? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her current offer ($105) and my previous offer ($90). It shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards my target price. 
* **Sense of fairness:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" might make Alice more receptive.
* **Final attempt:** If Alice rejects this, it might be time to consider John's offer as further negotiation might not yield significant savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $97.50 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $102.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly very attached to getting at least $100 for the product. While we could likely continue to negotiate in small increments, it's unlikely we'll get a price significantly better than John's offer at this point. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed saving."
