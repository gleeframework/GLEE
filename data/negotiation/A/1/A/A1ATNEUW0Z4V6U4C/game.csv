"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  How about we start with $15000? Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to go up to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9500. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $9500 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10750?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility. Let's try to close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
