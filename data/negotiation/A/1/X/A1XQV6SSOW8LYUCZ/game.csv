"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially pricing it at $18,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To make this work, I could come down to $15,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value you'll be getting.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  I could let it go for $13,500. This is a significant price reduction, and I'm really trying to find a number that works for us both.  I do have other interested buyers, but I believe this product would be a great fit for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product is desirable and you have other buyers, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.",10000.0,Bob,6,
