Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for me to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, while still getting a good deal.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** My message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Protecting my minimum:** I'm not going to sell the product for less than $15,000, so I have a safety net with John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **I can do better:**  I know that I can get at least $15,000 from John, so accepting Bob's offer would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer was low, he's showing willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffering closer to Bob's value:**  I'm counteroffering with $10,000, which is closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Reiterating the value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to justify my price, potentially encouraging Bob to see it as fair.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it still allows room to negotiate further if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of a stalemate:**  If I keep rejecting offers, we could get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers, and I might lose out on time and potentially a better deal with John.
* **Balancing the risk:**  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 as a final offer. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making this my final counteroffer, emphasizing that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Threat of walking away:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have another buyer waiting, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging him to accept the offer.
* **Balancing Risk:**  This is a calculated risk, as Bob might still reject my offer. However, if he does, I'm prepared to sell to John and ensure I don't lose out on a better deal."
