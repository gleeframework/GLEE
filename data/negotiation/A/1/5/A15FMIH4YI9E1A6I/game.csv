"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 as a final offer. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
