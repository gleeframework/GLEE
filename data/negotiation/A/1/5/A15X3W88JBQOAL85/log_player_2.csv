"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is too high.  You should reject and counteroffer to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than your desired price point. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. This is still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high for you. Since you are close to your budget from John, it makes more sense to purchase from John at this point. It's better to secure the product at your target price than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
