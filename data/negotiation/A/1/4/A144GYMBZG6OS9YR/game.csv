"Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a price that's lower than its true market value. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,
