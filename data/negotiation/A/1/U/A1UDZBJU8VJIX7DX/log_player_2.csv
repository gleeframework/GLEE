"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it can really benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic price considering its true value, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great opportunity. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, Alice is clearly trying to get a price significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might:

* Prompt Alice to offer a lower price in a subsequent attempt to make a sale.
* Allow you to counter-offer with a price closer to your desired range. 

You can always fall back on buying from John at $15,000, but there's a good chance you can get a better deal from Alice."
