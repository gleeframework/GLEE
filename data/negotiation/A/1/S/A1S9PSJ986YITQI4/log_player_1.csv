Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $18,000. I believe it offers exceptional value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By opening with $18,000, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob doesn't agree to this price, it can influence his perception of what a ""fair"" price might be, potentially leading to a higher final offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states willingness to discuss the price, indicating flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process.
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly mentioned to Bob, keeping John's $12,000 offer in mind provides a fallback option. This knowledge empowers you to walk away from the negotiation if it's not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's too early to accept. His immediate drop to $12,000 suggests there might be room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and proposing a counteroffer, you can try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $12,000 is significantly below my asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a 50/50 split between your initial offer and his makes it appear like a fair compromise, potentially making Bob more receptive. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $15,000 still represents a significant profit margin, keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility. His response will indicate how much further you might be able to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,500?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $13,500 is a good profit over your minimum of $12,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains.  Bob has shown some flexibility but is unlikely to drastically increase his offer.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or becoming frustrated with the negotiation process."
