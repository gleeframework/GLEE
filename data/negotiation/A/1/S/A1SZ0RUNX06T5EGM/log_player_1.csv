Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly.
* **Secure a Quick Sale:** Offering a price significantly above John's offer ($8,000) increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, leading to a faster sale. 

This strategy balances ambition with a good chance of success."
