"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if we can land closer to $7,000. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that could work for both of us. Considering the value you see in the product and your budget, I am willing to negotiate down to $8,500. This still allows us to maintain a fair value for the product while making it more accessible to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm getting closer to making this work, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're finding the price more manageable, Bob. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties. Considering your feedback, I propose a price of $8,250 for the product. This still represents a premium value, but it's more within your budget range.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am motivated to buy.  To get this deal done today, how about we split the difference and land at $8,000?  That's a fair price, and we both walk away happy.",8000.0,Bob,6,
