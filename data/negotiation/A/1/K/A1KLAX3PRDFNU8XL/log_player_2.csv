"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, considering how much value it will bring to your life! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product."
