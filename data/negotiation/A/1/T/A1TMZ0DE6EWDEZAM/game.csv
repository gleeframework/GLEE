"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, $11000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I can only stretch to $9800. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to go a bit higher. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $10300. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the concessions you've made so far.",10300.0,Bob,6,
