Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is not moving significantly towards a price point that works for you. She went down from $120 to $90, then back up to $95. This indicates she may be trying to hold out for a higher price. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $80 than risk further negotiation with Alice."
