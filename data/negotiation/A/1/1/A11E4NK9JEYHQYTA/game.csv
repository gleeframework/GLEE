"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best price for now, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise that allows us to both come away happy with the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
