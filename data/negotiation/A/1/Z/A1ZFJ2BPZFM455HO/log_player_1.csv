Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, giving Bob an incentive to consider buying. 
* It's also not too high, as it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit by:

* **Exploring potential for higher earnings:** Offering a price higher than John's offer allows for the possibility of earning more than $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining a realistic expectation:** The offer is still within a range where Bob might be willing to pay, considering the potential value of the product.

By starting with a slightly higher price, I can assess Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a mutually agreeable price."
