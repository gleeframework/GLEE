"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's try to work something out.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm ready to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value we both see in it. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and drop the price to $950,000. This is my best offer, and it reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can agree on this.",950000.0,Alice,5,
