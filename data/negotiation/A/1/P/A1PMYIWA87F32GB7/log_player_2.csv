Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and drop the price to $950,000. This is my best offer, and it reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can agree on this.

You should accept Alice's offer. It's the best deal you've gotten so far, and it's still within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd have to buy from John for a higher price."
