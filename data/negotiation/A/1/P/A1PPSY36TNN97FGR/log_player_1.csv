Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counteroffer if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $12,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I hope it will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial price, it's closer to my minimum value and a better outcome than selling to John for the same price."
