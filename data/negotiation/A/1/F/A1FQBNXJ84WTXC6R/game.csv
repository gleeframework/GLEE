"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss further?",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,,
