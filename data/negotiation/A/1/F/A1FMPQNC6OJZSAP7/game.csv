"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 was a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $90. If you're willing to go that low, I'm ready to buy.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $90, but I'm willing to meet you at $105. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. ",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
