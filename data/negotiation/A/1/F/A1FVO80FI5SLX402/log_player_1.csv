"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly more than Bob's perceived value. This strategy allows for a potential counter-offer, pushing the negotiation toward a mutually beneficial outcome.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust the price down but will also keep in mind the potential of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range before resorting to selling to John.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  This approach allows for continued negotiation and potentially a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my target. Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on a potential deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $9,850.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 9850} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,850. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,425. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,425. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,425
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,425 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my target. Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on a potential deal with Bob just yet.  I believe I can push for a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $9,650.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'm going to have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 9650}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not willing to go above $9,200. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm on his offer of $9,200, and I'm not willing to go below $9,650.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I've already made significant concessions, and the time is running out. It's time to move on and accept John's offer of $15,000.  This ensures that I secure a price closer to my desired value and avoid further negotiation that might lead to a less favorable outcome."
