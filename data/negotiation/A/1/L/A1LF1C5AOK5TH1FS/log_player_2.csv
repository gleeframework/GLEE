Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, but that's the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.
