"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's still a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  While I'm open to making a final concession, $120 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is my last offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",130.0,Alice,5,
