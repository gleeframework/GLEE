"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $25000. What are your thoughts?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $25000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8000. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is still too high for me. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but $8000 is not even close to its value. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to meet a minimum of $12000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's my absolute maximum.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to meet my minimum. I'm willing to consider $11000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to meet a minimum, but $11000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute final offer.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to buy the product from John.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $10500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, and I hope you can accept it.",10500.0,Alice,9,
