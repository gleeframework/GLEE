Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you at a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While this price is unlikely to be accepted, it creates room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" attempts to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about why the product is worth so much to you (and potentially pushing him away). 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: Creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially motivating Bob to consider the offer more seriously.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down while still staying comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000 from John). 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the high initial price.
2. **Open Negotiations:**  Even if rejected, the high price starts a dialogue where you can gauge Bob's interest and adjust accordingly.
3. **Secure a Backup:** You have the security of John's guaranteed offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
