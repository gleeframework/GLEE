"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a fair price for the quality of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $112.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the quality of this product.  Let's make this happen!",112.5,Alice,5,
