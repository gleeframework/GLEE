"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it for $175. That's way above my limit of $80.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a fair price for the quality of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$125 is still above my limit, but it's getting closer. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $112.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the quality of this product.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
$112.50 is still too much for me.  I've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it doesn't seem like Alice is willing to come down to my price point. I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $80, which is within my budget."
