"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is a bit low for me. I can do $110, which is a compromise. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $95. How about we meet at $105? It's a fair price for the quality of the product.",105.0,Alice,5,,
