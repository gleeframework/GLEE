Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's in excellent condition and would be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  His offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good deal considering the value of the product.  It's also important to avoid the risk of having him reject further counteroffers and potentially lose the deal altogether."
