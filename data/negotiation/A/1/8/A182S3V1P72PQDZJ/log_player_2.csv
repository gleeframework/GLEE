"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's in excellent condition and would be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a reasonable counteroffer, offering $11,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's original price, showing Bob is serious about buying but needs a lower price. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum of $12,000. Bob is better off rejecting and continuing to negotiate, aiming to get the price down to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his absolute maximum price of $12,000. This shows that he's serious about buying but won't go higher. This counteroffer emphasizes the fairness of the price and creates a sense of urgency. It's likely Alice will accept this offer to avoid losing the deal."
