Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value proposition. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting $850,000 is a significant gain over my minimum and avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely. It's a strong deal at this point in the negotiation."
