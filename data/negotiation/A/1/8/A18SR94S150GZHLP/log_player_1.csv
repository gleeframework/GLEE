Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1,250,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
