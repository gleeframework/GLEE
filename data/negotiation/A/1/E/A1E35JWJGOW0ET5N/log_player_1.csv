``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to secure a profit.  I'll keep in mind that I can always settle for $8,000 by selling to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $8,000. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This would still give you a great deal on the product, and I would be happy with the price."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'll sell the product to John for $8,000 to ensure I get a fair price."
