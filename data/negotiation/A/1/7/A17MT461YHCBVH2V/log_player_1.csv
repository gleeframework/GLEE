{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for potential concessions if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It allows for potential compromise without immediately hitting a wall.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to make a deal.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup option with John.  By rejecting this offer, I can:

* **Maintain my leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore a higher counteroffer:**  I can try to push for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  See if he's truly willing to negotiate or if he's just trying to lowball me.

By keeping the negotiation open, I can potentially get a better deal. If Bob walks away, I can always sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining leverage. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the potential for a win-win situation, emphasizing that this price would still be beneficial for both of us. 
* **Staying above my Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps me above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell for less than what the product is worth to me.

This strategy aims to continue the negotiation, potentially reach a mutually agreeable price, and avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,350,000 is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my counteroffer and is getting closer to my desired price. This indicates that we are on a trajectory towards a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum, the risk of losing the deal altogether by rejecting this offer is higher. 
* **Time and Effort:**  The negotiation has already gone back and forth, and continuing could lead to further delays and uncertainties. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $1,325,000 is the best strategy in this scenario. It maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal and needing to sell to John."
