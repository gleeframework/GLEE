"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is asking $115. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
