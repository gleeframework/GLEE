"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still outside of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make this purchase work within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,500. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to offer $10,000, and I believe this is a fair compromise. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $13,500 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a significant step for me, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's reach a compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,500, which is my best price for now. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my minimum price. Let's see if we can close the deal.",12500.0,Alice,9,
