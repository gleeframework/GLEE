"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This reflects its potential while still offering you a competitive advantage.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000? I believe that's a fair price for the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try this - $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly compensates for the true value of the product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,300,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
