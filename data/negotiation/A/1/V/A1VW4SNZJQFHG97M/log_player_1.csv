Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. $12,000 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $13,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer, $12,500 is still too low.  I'm going to try to get him up to $13,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be reasonable here.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,750?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $12,750, I'm only two rounds away from potentially selling to John for $10,000. I'll try to get Bob closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here.  Let's cut to the chase.  How about $12,900? It's just a small step up from your last offer, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's close this now!"", ""product_price"": 12900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your urgency, but I'm not willing to go above $12,500. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  With only two rounds left, I don't have time to keep negotiating with Bob.  While $12,500 is a better offer than John's $10,000, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept my next offer.  It's better to secure the sale with John now."
