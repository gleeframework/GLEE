"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still allows me to make a decent profit. This is a final offer from my side. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still aiming to keep the cost at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and my budget constraints. Could we possibly reach an agreement closer to my desired price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
