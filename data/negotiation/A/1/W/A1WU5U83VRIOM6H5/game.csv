"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1650000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me in the middle.

"I understand that you're still trying to negotiate, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum price.

"I've made it clear that I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to start considering other options if we can't come to an agreement.
