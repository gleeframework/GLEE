"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1050000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
