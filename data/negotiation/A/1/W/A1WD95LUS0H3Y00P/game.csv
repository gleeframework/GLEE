"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price at $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so let's see if we can make a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
