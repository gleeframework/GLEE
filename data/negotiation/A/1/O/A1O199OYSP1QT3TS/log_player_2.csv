"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1000000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the potential returns are well worth it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a price I'm confident in, given the product's potential. Consider this your chance to secure a valuable asset. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is your maximum budget. Since you know John is also willing to sell the product for the same price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you're not obligated to buy from her. It's best to reject her offer and see if you can get a better deal elsewhere."
