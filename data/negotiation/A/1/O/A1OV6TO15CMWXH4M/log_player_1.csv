Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still keeping me well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident but Open:** The tone of the message suggests confidence in the product's value while still inviting Bob's perspective and potentially opening the door for a discussion.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product. If I had more information, I might adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net and ensures I don't settle for less than my minimum."
