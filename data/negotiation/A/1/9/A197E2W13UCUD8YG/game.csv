"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price point that works a bit better for my budget. How about we consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this incredible product.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $650,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more savings.  Would you be open to $600,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to save a bit more, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the product's true value to you. I'm offering it to you for $620,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",620000.0,Alice,5,
