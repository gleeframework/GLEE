"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I'm okay with $10,500 if you can throw in [something small but of value - e.g., free shipping, an accessory, a service plan, etc.].  Otherwise, I'd like to propose $10,250 as my final offer.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of adding some value to the deal! I'm willing to throw in free shipping and a 1-year warranty, which is a $500 value. In return, I'd like to counteroffer at $10,750. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,7,
