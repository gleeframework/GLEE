Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the idea of adding some value to the deal! I'm willing to throw in free shipping and a 1-year warranty, which is a $500 value. In return, I'd like to counteroffer at $10,750. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.

This is a good deal for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, Alice has signaled this is her final compromise. Getting the product for $10,750 including shipping and a warranty represents solid savings and is well below his $15,000 upper limit."
