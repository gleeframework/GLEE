Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get at least $10,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I can still get $10,000 from John. I'm going to see if I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough to Bob without completely alienating him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm not confident I can get much higher with further negotiation.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk a stalemate or a lower price with Bob."
