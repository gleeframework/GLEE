Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price not exceeding $1,500,000. I believe this reflects a fair assessment of the product's value to me. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to this figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, considering my financial situation, I am only able to consider a price up to $1,500,000. I believe this aligns closely with the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet at this price point?

Reason: Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,500,000.  It's clear he has a firm budget. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at that same price, it makes no sense to continue negotiations with Bob.  Time is money, and it's better to secure the sale with John."
