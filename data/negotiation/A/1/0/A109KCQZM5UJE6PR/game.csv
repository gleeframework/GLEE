"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. I could make this work at $1,000,000. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
