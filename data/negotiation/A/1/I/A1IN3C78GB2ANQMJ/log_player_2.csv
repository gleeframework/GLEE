Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at $8,500.  While this is closer to your target price, you know you have John as a guaranteed backup at $8,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when you can get your target price from John."
