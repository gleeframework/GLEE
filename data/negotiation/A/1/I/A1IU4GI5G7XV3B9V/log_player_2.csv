"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob has a significant margin to work with and should aim for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should continue negotiating and try to bring the price down further.  There is still room for compromise, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to do so."
