"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $15,000 is a little steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $11,500 yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",13500.0,Alice,5,
