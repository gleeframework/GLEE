Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to earn as much as possible, so starting with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150) makes sense.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his perceived value ($120). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 creates a perceived deal for Bob while still netting you a significant profit. If he rejects this offer, you can always sell to John at your minimum."
