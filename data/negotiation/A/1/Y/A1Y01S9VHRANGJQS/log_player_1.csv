Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I believe a price of $14,000 is fair considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a strong fallback option with John at $10,000, so you don't need to be desperate.

By starting high but leaving some room for negotiation, you increase the chances of getting a price closer to Bob's perceived value while still ensuring you get at least your minimum."
