Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $119. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. Offering it slightly below my minimum ensures a profit if he accepts.
* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high allows room to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this price. However, this strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still leaving me with a profitable alternative."
