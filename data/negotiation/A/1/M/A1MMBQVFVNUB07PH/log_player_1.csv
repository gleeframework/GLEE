Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could offer it for $150 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob will accept a lower price, netting a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a price point that's more appealing to Bob (above his perceived value) while still securing a decent profit for me.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing out as I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150."
