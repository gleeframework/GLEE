Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product for $150. I believe it's highly valuable and you won't regret the purchase. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn the most money. Starting with a higher offer gives room for negotiation and the potential to get more than Bob's perceived value ($100) or at least your minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer guarantees at least $100, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 
* **Psychology:** A slightly ambitious opening offer might pique Bob's interest, making him think the product is worth more than he initially thought.

**Important:** This strategy assumes there's no negative impact on Bob's willingness to negotiate if the initial price is too high.  Observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer can guide further negotiation."
