"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $6,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I could consider a price of $10,500.  This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,500 for it. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  However, I can't justify going above $8,000.  If you're willing to reconsider, I'm ready to buy right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
