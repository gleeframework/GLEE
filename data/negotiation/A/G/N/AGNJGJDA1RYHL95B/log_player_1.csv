{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a good deal for you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering it at $1,000,000 (Bob's value) is unlikely to be accepted as I lose potential profit. Offering it at or above $1,200,000 leaves no room for negotiation and Bob will likely reject it.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It positions the product as highly valuable while leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages Bob to engage in discussion, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
