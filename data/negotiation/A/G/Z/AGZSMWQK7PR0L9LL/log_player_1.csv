"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I create space for negotiation and hopefully get Bob to counter-offer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially get closer to a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I want to see if I can get closer to that number with some negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate further. This gives me the opportunity to send a counter-offer that could potentially get us both closer to a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, emphasizing fairness and highlighting the value proposition to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm aiming to close the gap and find a price that's mutually agreeable. This approach increases the chances of a successful negotiation and avoids a potential stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price that's closer to $100.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to securing a price that's more advantageous for me.  This keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to make another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle again at $93.75. It's a fair price, and it's a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 93.75}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm again offering a middle ground, this time between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $92.50. This shows continued willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I reiterate the value proposition for Bob while emphasizing the fairness of my offer. I'm aiming to build a sense of urgency and encourage a quick deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm sticking to the ""meet in the middle"" strategy, which demonstrates a cooperative approach. This tactic could lead to a faster agreement without losing too much ground.  The goal is to reach a deal within the remaining rounds without resorting to selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're now at Round 6, and Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers, settling at $92.50. While this is getting closer to my desired price, I'm concerned about running out of rounds. There's a risk that Bob might keep counteroffering at the same price, and I might end up with a lower deal than I'm comfortable with. 

**Strategy:**

It's more advantageous to sell to John for $100, which guarantees my minimum threshold and avoids the risk of a lower price. It's important to prioritize a secure deal over potentially prolonged negotiations that could result in a less favorable outcome."
