"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $925,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away from the deal and exploring other options. Can you reconsider and meet me at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
