"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
