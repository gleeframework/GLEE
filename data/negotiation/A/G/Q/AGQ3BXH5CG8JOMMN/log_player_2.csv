"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $12,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its true worth while offering you significant savings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair transaction."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This still reflects the value of the item while offering a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. However, it's significantly closer than her previous offer and is within a reasonable range for negotiation. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for a price that's closer to his ideal and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer or the possibility of John raising his price."
