"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is closer to my asking price, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  It's a fair compromise and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
