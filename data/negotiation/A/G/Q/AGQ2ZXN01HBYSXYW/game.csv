,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tight. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit closer to what you're willing to pay, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $128. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",128.0,Alice,5,
