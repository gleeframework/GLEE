,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,150,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's fair for me as well.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,200,000? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
