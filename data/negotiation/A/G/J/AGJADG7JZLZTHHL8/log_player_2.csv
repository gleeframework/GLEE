"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe you'd be interested in. It's valued at $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount compared to her valuation, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You can get the product for a better price from John."
