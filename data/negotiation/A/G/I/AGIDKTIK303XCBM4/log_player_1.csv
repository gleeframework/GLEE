Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000. This is a slightly higher price than the product's value to Bob, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and begin the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with the product's value to him.  I believe this price is fair and gives us both a chance to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
