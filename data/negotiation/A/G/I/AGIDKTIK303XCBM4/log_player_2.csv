You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can save at least $50,000 by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price $100,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This should spark negotiations and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is now at my maximum value.  It's in my best interest to accept and avoid the potential of further negotiation or a risk of John increasing his price."
