"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer** means buying the product for $1,000,000. This is a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** would force Bob to buy from John, which is more expensive. 
* **Buying from John** is the worst option as it's the most expensive. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob to save the most money."
