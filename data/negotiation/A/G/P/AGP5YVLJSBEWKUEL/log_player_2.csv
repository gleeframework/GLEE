"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is way above your budget. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the lowest price I'm willing to pay. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is better than $180, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying below my maximum budget. I'm hoping this shows Alice I'm serious about buying, while still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $155 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to come down further before I go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140, which is still below my maximum budget. I think this is a fair compromise, and hopefully Alice will accept. If not, I'll go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and it's clear she's not willing to budge much more.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John, even though I'd prefer to get the product for $120."
