"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is significantly lower than what I need to sell for. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it works for me.",125.0,Alice,3,
