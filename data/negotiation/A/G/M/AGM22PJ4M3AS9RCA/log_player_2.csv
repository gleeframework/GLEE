{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is getting closer to my budget, I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation.  I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a better price from Alice.  To avoid further haggling and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll purchase it from John for $1,200,000."
