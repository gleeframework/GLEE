"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my research and the market value, I believe the product is worth around $700,000 to me. Would you consider lowering the price to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of this product and its potential, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
