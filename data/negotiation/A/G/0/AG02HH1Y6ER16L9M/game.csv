"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you halfway between $11,000 and $14,000, which would be $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
