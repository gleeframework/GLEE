Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer:

Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit closer to our desired price point. We're still aiming for a price higher than what John offers."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $9,500 offer.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
