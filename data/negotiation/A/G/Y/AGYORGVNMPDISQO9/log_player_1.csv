Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob's offers are increasing, we have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $880,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now very close to our previous counteroffer. While we could try to squeeze a little more, the difference is getting small. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
