Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $11,500 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is more than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to try and negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair price for both of us.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe you'll see a great return on your investment.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,900. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to a deal with Bob, but it's clear that he's not willing to go much higher.  Even though Bob's offer of $9,900 is a small step closer to my desired price, I'm now starting to feel the pressure of time.  With only a few rounds remaining, I'm worried I won't be able to get to a price that meets my minimum.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to guarantee my desired profit."
