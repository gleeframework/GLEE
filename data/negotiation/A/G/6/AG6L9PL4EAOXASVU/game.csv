"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than the base value we discussed.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the pricing, however, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment made in its development. I'm willing to negotiate, so to find a middle ground, I could let it go for $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. To be completely transparent, I have a firm budget for this purchase, and $1,200,000 is the absolute maximum I can spend.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
