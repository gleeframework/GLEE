"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $150, so rejecting Alice's offer of $140 is the best option in this situation. You can try to negotiate a lower price and save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You're trying to get the best deal, but Alice's offer of $135 is within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $150."
