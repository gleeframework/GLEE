Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 gives Bob a $2,000 discount (incentivizing him to buy), while you earn a $2,000 profit over your minimum.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more than your fallback option (John)."
