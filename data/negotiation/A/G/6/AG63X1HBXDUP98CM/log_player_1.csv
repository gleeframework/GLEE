Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $10,000.  I want to maximize my profit, but also leave room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm willing to meet halfway, but still want to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $12,500 is a good price considering the back and forth. It's above my minimum and a reasonable compromise.  I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's lower offer."
