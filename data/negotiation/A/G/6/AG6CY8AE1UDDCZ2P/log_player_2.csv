"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a good deal, it's still above Bob's target of $1,200,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend a little less. I'm happy to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still above Bob's target of $1,200,000, but it's a significant improvement from the initial $1,000,000.  At this point, it's a good compromise.  If Bob rejects the offer, he risks Alice hardening her stance or the negotiation dragging on.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price, saving him $250,000 compared to buying from John."
