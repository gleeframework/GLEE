"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $8000, as that's what I'm willing to spend.  If you're not willing to come down further, I'll have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,4,
