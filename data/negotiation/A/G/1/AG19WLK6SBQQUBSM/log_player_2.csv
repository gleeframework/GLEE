"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking for a product worth no more than $120 to you, and Alice's offer is above that. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $120? That's my absolute top end."", ""product_price"": 120}
