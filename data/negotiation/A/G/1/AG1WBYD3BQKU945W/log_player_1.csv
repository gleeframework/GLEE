Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $10,000.  This is my best and final offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too much for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is clearly set on $10,000 and unwilling to budge. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
