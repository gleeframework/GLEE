{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm also framing it as a good deal to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to make a sale, $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $115 is still a bit much for me.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to sell the product, Bob's offer of $75 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $75 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $100. I think that's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 100}
