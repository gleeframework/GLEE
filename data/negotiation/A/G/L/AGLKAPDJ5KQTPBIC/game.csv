"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850000.
