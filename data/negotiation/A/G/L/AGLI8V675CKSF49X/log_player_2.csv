"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $9,000, which is still within your budget. 
* However, you can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. There is a possibility that Alice will accept a lower price, especially since the product is worth $8,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can do $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, and $9,200 is still within my budget.
* While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I might end up paying the full $10,000 to John. 
* It's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and save $800 compared to buying from John."
