Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,100,000 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Value emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could potentially start even higher and be willing to negotiate down to $1,200,000.  The key is to leverage your guaranteed buyer to get the best possible price from Bob."
