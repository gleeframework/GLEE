Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $115 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still being above Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to close the deal."
