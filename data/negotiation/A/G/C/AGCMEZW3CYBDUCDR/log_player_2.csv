"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the price he can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation while demonstrating Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still above John's price. There's room for more negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but still trying to stay below John's offer. By increasing his counteroffer slightly, he shows his willingness to compromise while maintaining the negotiation momentum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly closer to her initial price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will come down significantly further.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Alice might reject Bob's counteroffers, potentially leading to a stalemate. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer."
