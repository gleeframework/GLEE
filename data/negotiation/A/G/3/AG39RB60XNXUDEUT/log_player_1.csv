Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit vs. Securing the Deal:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the likelihood of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 positions it as a significant discount from John's offer while still securing a substantial profit above Bob's valuation. 
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages dialogue, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
