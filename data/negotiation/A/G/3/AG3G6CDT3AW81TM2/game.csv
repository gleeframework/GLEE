"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $1200000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still think $1750000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1500000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this revised offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
