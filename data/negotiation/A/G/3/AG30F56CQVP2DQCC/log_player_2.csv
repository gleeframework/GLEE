"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than what he'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $10,750?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,000? This is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than what he would pay John, and it's closer to Bob's desired price point.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product while saving $1,000 compared to buying from John."
