"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value anchors the negotiation high. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message aims to sound enthusiastic and positive while leaving the door open for Bob's response.  His reaction will give me insight into his willingness to negotiate within this price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a substantial profit, it's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. Bob's message also indicates room for negotiation (""more reasonable price""). I'll counter to steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market. However, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Meeting Bob halfway shows a willingness to negotiate but holds firm on a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's unique value, I reinforce its worth and subtly counter Bob's market conditions argument. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  The message aims to keep a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more balanced price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Bob is consistently making incremental offers, suggesting he is willing to negotiate upwards, but at his own pace. 
* **Value Gap:** While $1,200,000 is tempting, the difference between his offer and his perceived value ($1,500,000) is still significant. There's room for more.
* **Time Consideration:**  With several rounds remaining, I can afford to continue negotiating strategically to close that gap. However, I need to be mindful of larger concessions to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,275,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen while recognizing the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:**  A $50,000 decrease from my previous offer signals flexibility and a genuine attempt to find common ground.
* **Framing the Deal:** Highlighting that this price benefits both parties aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a favorable resolution.
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):**  By expressing my desire to ""make this deal happen,"" I subtly imply that the opportunity won't last forever, encouraging Bob to act sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to go as low as $1,225,000 to make it work for me. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I believe the product is worth more, Bob's concessions are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer from here.
* **Strong Profit Margin:** $1,225,000 is still a significant profit ($225,000 above my minimum) and a good return on the negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more risks Bob walking away or my offers becoming too close to John's backup offer, making the negotiation pointless.

It's time to secure a good deal while I have it."
