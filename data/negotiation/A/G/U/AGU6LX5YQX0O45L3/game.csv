,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm proposing a price of $1100000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and it leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $950000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to finalize this deal at a price closer to my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the value I've placed on this product. To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1025000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1025000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm prepared to offer $1010000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a price that I believe is fair, given the value of the product and my budget. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options.",1010000.0,Bob,8,
