It's always worth negotiating, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer gives you the chance to try and get a better price."

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what you're comfortable with and you can get the product for less from John.  It's worth pushing for a lower price from Alice."
