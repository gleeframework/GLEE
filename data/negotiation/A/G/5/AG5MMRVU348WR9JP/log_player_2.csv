"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to both of us. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I propose a purchase price of $1,350,000. This amount reflects a fair valuation that takes into account the product's worth to you and ensures a reasonable profit for me. I believe this offer strikes a balance between our interests and presents an attractive proposition for you to consider. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there's any way I can provide additional information to help you make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. However, you know you have another option with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for a counter-offer. Alice might be willing to lower the price to secure the sale, getting you a better deal."
