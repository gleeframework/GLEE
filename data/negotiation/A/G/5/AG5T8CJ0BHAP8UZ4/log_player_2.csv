We're still a good bit away from Alice's value.  It's worth continuing the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $7,900. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and $8,200 is a reasonable price, giving a good balance between getting a decent deal and not risking losing the product to John's higher price."
