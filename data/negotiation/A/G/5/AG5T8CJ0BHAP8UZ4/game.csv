"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I do like the product, $8,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,900?",7900.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $7,900. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
