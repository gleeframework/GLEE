"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,800,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $1,650,000? That feels like a fair price for both of us. ",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,650,000. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to get at least $1,680,000 for the product. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to add extras to the deal. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,660,000.  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1660000.0,Bob,6,
