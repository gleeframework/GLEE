"I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $17000? It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $14000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to be careful with my finances. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,6,
