"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Could you consider a price closer to that range?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1300000. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not quite there yet. I can offer you a price of $1300000. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find the product is worth every penny. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1290000, but no higher. Could you consider meeting me at that price?",1290000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1295000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1295000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than my last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. I can offer you a price of $1295000, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package that's worth $20000. So, effectively, you'll be getting the product for $1275000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1275000.0,Alice,9,

"Thank you for the additional value, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stick to my budget. Could you consider a price of $1200000, and we can discuss the premium support package separately?",1200000.0,Bob,10,
