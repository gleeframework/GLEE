Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more affordable option, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go lower than $10,500.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a very small chance of saving you $500, but a high chance of costing you time and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
