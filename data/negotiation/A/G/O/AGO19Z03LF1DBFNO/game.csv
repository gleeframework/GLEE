"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could we potentially settle on a price of $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $17,000 is still a little high for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
