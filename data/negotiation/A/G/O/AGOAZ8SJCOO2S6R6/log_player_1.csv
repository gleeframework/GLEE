Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I'll keep in mind that I can always fall back to John's offer of $12,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me at this price.  If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low. While I'd like to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially get stuck with an even lower offer.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the most sensible option at this point."
