"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value for it, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's value to both of us.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I stay within my budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach a deal on this.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
