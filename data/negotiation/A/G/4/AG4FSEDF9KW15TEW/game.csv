"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. I know it's a valuable asset and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This reflects the true value of the product while giving you a significant price advantage over buying it from John.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1200000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1000000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1000000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $1100000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget, and it would get this deal done.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
