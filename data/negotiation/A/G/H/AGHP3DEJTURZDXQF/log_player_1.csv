Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the phrase ""given its value"" hints at its significance and justifies the higher asking price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying other buyers), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your ultimate goal is to maximize profit while ensuring the sale doesn't fall through."
