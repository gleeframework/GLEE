"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I think it's a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle on this one.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down to $12,500. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,250. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to pay that much for it.",12250.0,Bob,4,
