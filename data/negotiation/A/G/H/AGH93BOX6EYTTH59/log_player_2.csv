"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  You always have the option to buy from John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her valuation of the product ($120). This gives room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed positively, expressing interest while clearly stating the desired price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting lower, you signal your willingness to negotiate but set the stage for potentially meeting in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, and $125 is a great price, well within your budget and saving you $25 compared to buying from John. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal."
