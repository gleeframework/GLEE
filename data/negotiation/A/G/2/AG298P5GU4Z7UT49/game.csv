,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1600000, which would be $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1500000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1550000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1450000 and $1600000, which would be $1525000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm appreciating your efforts to find a compromise.  However, $1525000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1500000, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000 is too high, but I can do $1580000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1580000.0,Alice,9,
