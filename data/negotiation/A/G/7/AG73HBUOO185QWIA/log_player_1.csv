Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant returns you'll see.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high asking price, framing it as an investment opportunity.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, the message ends by inviting Bob's thoughts, leaving room for negotiation and a potential compromise. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining a chance to close the deal with Bob."
