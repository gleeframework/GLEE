"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more, especially with the option to sell to John.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows me to make a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1450000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with a price that low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can get a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,550,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1480000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, we are running out of rounds. With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned I won't be able to get a price that I'm comfortable with.  Therefore, it's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
