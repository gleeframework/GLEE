Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Potential Upside:**  By offering $15,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and a potential higher profit. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000, I'm not risking a significant loss if Bob rejects the offer. 

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
