"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $155. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $155 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $140. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $147. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",147.0,Alice,5,
