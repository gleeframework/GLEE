"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in.  It's something that's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
