"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its true value. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for cheaper from John ($1,000,000) than Alice's current offer ($950,000).  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to you. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is fair for both of us and ensures a profitable deal for both parties.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $900,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  It's still slightly above your ideal price, but it's a good compromise."
