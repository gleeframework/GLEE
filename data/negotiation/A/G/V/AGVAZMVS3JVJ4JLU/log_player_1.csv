Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to you. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
