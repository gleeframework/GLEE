While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's increasing his offers in very small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to my minimum, and further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming.  It's in my best interest to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
