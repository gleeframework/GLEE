Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** A friendly and direct message explains the offer and encourages Bob to consider it. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high offer, I aim to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  The initial offer is close to my ideal price.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's response will reveal his willingness to negotiate and his price range.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The offer allows for potential concessions if Bob counters.

If Bob rejects, I will assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should move on to John for my guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

While I am open to negotiating, Bob's initial counteroffer is too far off from my expectations.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my position:** It demonstrates that I am not willing to settle for an undervalue.
* **Continue negotiations:** It gives me an opportunity to make a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price point that is acceptable to both parties. If we can't reach an agreement, I will proceed with selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $950,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it gives you a fair opportunity to acquire it. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer of $1,100,000, but it's still higher than Bob's current offer. It signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to sell for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Message:** The message is polite and acknowledges Bob's desire for a good deal. It also emphasizes the value of the product and aims to create a sense of common ground. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $1,050,000, I aim to:

* **Test Bob's flexibility:**  This counteroffer sees if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price point.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** It allows for further discussion and potential compromise. 
* **Show my commitment to selling:**  Demonstrating that I am still open to negotiation, while not sacrificing my minimum acceptable price. 

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will carefully consider his next offer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's still below my ideal price, the difference is now relatively small.  

**Strategy:**

Accepting this offer allows me to:

* **Secure a sale:**  It guarantees a sale without risking further negotiation.
* **Minimize potential loss:** It's a good deal considering my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Save time and effort:** It avoids further negotiation rounds and potential delays.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. This outcome is a reasonable compromise and a good result for both parties."
