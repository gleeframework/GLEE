Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't want to pay more than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**The Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate down while still staying above your guaranteed price. However, going too high might make Bob immediately walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's framed positively, emphasizing the product's value.  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point for discussion"" signals your willingness to negotiate.
* **The Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while keeping you well above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower (but never below $1,500,000).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive starting price might be better."
