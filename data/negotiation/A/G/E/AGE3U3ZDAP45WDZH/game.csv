"Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle, though. How about we discuss $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
