"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1800000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you.  What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 simply doesn't cover the value I place on this product.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product offers, and it gives us both something to work with.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
