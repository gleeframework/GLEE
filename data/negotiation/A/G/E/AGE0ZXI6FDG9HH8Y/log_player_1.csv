"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'll see how he reacts to this offer.  If he rejects, I'll adjust accordingly."

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and continue the negotiations."
