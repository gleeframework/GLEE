"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $18,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, as that's the maximum value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to lower the price to $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm really only able to spend $8,000 on this product. Let's try to meet in the middle.  If we can't find a price that works for both of us, I might need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too much for me. I'm really pushing my limit at $8,000.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers, at $10,000.  This is a fair compromise that hopefully allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm proposing a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that.",11000.0,Alice,7,
