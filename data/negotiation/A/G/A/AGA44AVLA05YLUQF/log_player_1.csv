Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $18,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, as that's the maximum value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm really only able to spend $8,000 on this product. Let's try to meet in the middle.  If we can't find a price that works for both of us, I might need to explore other options.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
