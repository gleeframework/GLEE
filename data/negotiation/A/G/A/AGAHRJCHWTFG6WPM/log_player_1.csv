"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's value but leaves some room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit while also keeping the deal open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering a price of $100. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above Bob's value but is closer to his price, hopefully leading to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. $85 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'll counteroffer again, but if it doesn't work out, I'll move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my minimum. I want to see if we can find common ground before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are too low for me to accept. While I'd like to get a better price, I don't want to risk wasting any more time. I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a profit."
