"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I'm putting into making this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
