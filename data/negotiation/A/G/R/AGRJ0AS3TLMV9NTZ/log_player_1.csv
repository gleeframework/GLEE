Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm always keeping John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I'll try to squeeze out a bit more profit by making a counteroffer in the next round. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a better price than Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer ensures I get a better return than selling to John, and it ends the negotiation quickly."
