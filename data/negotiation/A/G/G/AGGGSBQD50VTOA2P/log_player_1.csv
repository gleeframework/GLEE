Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a price that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to me and the possibility of selling it to John for $80. 

I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $95 is close to my desired price and significantly higher than selling to John. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
