"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your maximum budget, you can get a better deal from John. John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, but by rejecting Alice's offer, you open the opportunity for a counter-offer potentially closer to John's price."
