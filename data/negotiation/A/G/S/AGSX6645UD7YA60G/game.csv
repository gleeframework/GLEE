"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  I believe this revised offer reflects a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest though, anything over $800,000 is a difficult sell for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
