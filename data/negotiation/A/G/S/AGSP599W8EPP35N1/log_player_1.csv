``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, and it also signals that I believe the product is valuable. I'm also including a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll use the next round to see if I can bridge the gap."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get a higher price than $1,250,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my last offer, but still higher than what Bob is currently offering.  I'm willing to keep negotiating since we're close to a potential deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price.  We're near the middle ground, and I'm confident that I can still convince Bob to go a bit higher.  I'll counter with a price slightly closer to his offer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like a bit more, we're down to the wire and I've been able to secure a price well above my minimum. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
