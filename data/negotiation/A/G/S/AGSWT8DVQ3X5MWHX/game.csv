"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is my best offer for now.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'll meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",750000.0,Alice,5,
