"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible.
* A counteroffer of $11,000 is still above Alice's minimum selling price of $10,000, leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's ideal price point and closer to his maximum budget.
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.
*  There are still several rounds left, giving Bob more opportunities to make counteroffers and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,100.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money while still being flexible in his negotiation. 
* This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.
* It leaves room for Alice to potentially counter, but it's still closer to Bob's ideal price point than Alice's last offer. 
* With several rounds remaining, Bob can continue to adjust his offer if needed."
