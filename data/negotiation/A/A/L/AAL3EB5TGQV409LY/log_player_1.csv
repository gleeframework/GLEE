Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Anchoring:** The initial price acts as an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if it's high, it sets a reference point for the rest of the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob allows me to potentially secure a better deal. If negotiations with Bob stagnate, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's offer. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, there's still room for negotiation. Bob countered quickly, indicating he's eager to purchase. By rejecting and countering, we can potentially push the price higher and secure a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I had in mind.  The value this product brings is significant, and to be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This feels like a good compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's price while still staying significantly above John's offer. It signals a willingness to negotiate while holding firm on the product's value.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the counteroffer (""fair to both of us,"" ""acknowledges the product's worth"") strengthens the position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer rather than accepting Bob's offer immediately, we keep the negotiation active and maintain the possibility of securing a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000) and well above John's standing offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. However, his increments are getting smaller, suggesting we're nearing his upper limit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob backing out or stalling. Accepting now secures a very good deal without jeopardizing the sale."
