"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While I appreciate your offer, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Alice,5,
