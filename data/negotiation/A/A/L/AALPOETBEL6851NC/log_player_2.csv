"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice's starting price is only $1,000 less than that. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **You have time.** You have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Focuses on value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to you, making the price seem more justifiable. 
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  By stating a specific price, you're making it clear what you're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would represent a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a compromise, $13,000 is still $1,000 more than your ideal price.
* **There's still room to negotiate.** You can likely get closer to your desired price of $12,000. 
* **You're in a good position.** You've shown you're willing to negotiate and you have more rounds to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  Would you be open to $12,500? That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $12,000 and Alice's offer of $13,000.
* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're willing to meet in the middle, making you seem more reasonable.
* **Maintain your position:** While offering a higher price than your initial offer, you're still keeping it lower than what Alice wants.

This strategy aims to:

* Show Alice that you are serious about buying the product.
*  Slowly move the price down towards your target.
*  Maintain the negotiation process, giving you more time to potentially get a better deal."
