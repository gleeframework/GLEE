"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to you ($15,000). 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering.
* **No immediate urgency:** You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting halfway:** The $12,000 offer is halfway between Alice's initial price and your maximum price.
* **Clarity:** The message is direct and clear, setting a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your target:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,000 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **Room for more negotiation:** There's still a gap between Alice's offer and your desired price. 
* **No urgency:** You have 7 more rounds and the backup option of John, so there's no need to settle now.

**Next Step:**

You'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your target of $12,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
