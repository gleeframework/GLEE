"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand that $700,000 is a bit low for us, but we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. We believe this is a fair compromise given the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,
