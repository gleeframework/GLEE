"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $950000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is $50000 more than your last offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
