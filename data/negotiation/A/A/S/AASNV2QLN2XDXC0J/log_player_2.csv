Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but $20,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $14,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'd like to push the price down a bit more. I'm thinking $15,500 is a fair price for the product.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,500. I believe it's a price that reflects the value I'll get from the product while being reasonable for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
