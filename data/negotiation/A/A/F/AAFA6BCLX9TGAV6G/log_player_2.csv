Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,200. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $11,200, he's still saving $800 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation may lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee and it risks losing the deal entirely."
