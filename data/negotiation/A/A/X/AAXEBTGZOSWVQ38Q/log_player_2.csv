"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being flexible and I understand your financial constraints. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my desired price. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $12,000, and it's closer to his desired price than John's offer.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation or losing out to John."
