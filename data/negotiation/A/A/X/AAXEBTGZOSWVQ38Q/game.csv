"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being flexible and I understand your financial constraints. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my desired price. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a fair price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
