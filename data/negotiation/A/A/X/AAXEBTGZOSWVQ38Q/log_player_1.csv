{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed.  The message is friendly and open to discussion, aiming to build rapport and encourage a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being flexible and I understand your financial constraints. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my desired price. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
