"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's slightly more than Alice values the product for, accepting the $140 offer is the best choice for Bob in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Saves money:** Buying from Alice at $140 is cheaper than John's $150 price.
* **Within budget:**  The offer is under Bob's $150 maximum. 
 
Even though there might be a chance to negotiate further with Alice, accepting now guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
