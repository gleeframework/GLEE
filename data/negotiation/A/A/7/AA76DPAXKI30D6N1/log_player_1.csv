Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I value the product at $1,000,000, so I won't sell it for less. 
* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $800,000, so I need to find a price within his range, but closer to my desired price.
* **John's value:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which gives me a safety net.
* **Offer:**  I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a compromise that is more profitable than selling to John, but still within Bob's potential budget.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a calculated risk.  There's a chance Bob will reject it, but the potential profit of $100,000 is worth the gamble. If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John."
