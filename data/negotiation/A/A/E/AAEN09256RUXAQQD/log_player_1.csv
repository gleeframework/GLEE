Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is unlikely unless you can convince Bob of additional value.

**Strategies**

Since a ZOPA doesn't exist, you have two main options:

1. **Aim High and Negotiate:** You could start with a high offer, hoping Bob might be willing to stretch his budget slightly. This leaves room for negotiation but risks losing him.

2. **Accept John's Offer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your desired price, it's perfectly reasonable to prioritize this deal for a clean and immediate transaction.

**Offer (Option 1 - Aim High and Negotiate)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment and open to discussing the details further."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Price:**  This starting point is above both your minimum and Bob's maximum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value-Focused:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value,"" attempting to justify the high price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  You signal willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Rejection:** Be prepared for Bob to reject this offer. You can then move to John confidently.
* **Negotiation Skills:** If Bob engages, your negotiation skills will be crucial to finding a middle ground (if one exists).

**Offer (Option 2 - Accept John's Offer)**

In this case, you would not send an offer to Bob and proceed directly to selling to John.

**Which strategy is best?**

The best strategy depends on your risk tolerance and how much you value time:

* **Option 1 (Negotiate):**  Offers the *potential* for higher profit but carries the *risk* of losing both buyers if negotiations fail. 
* **Option 2 (John's Offer):** Guarantees your desired profit with no risk, making it the safer and faster option."
