Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, justifying the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging that Bob has the option to decline and that you have a guaranteed sale with John."
