Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum.** This creates room for negotiation without immediately ending the conversation.
* **It's a clear and concise message.**  Bob understands the offer right away.
* **It expresses a willingness to negotiate.** The message implies that you're open to a counteroffer.

By starting with this offer, you set a good foundation for a successful negotiation, while also ensuring that you don't immediately drop to Bob's preferred price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and even lower than your initial offer.  You have room to negotiate and can likely get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,750? This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $12750 is a fair split of the difference. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12500. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is still lower than what you initially hoped for, it's very close to the middle ground you offered in your previous counteroffer. It's also only $500 below your minimum acceptable price.  Considering that you can always sell to John for $15,000, accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
