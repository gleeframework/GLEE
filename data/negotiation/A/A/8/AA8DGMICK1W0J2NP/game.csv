"Bob, I understand your position, but $11500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12750? This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure $12750 is a fair split of the difference. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12500. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",12500.0,Bob,4,
