Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a good starting point. It's a significant profit for me, but still leaves some room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will gain by purchasing the product.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message implies that I'm willing to negotiate further, which can encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the potential counteroffers that may follow."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss.  I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize my own minimum price point.
* **Compromise:**  I offer a counteroffer that's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. 
* **Fairness:** I highlight the fairness of the new price, implying that it's beneficial for both parties.
* **Smooth Transaction:**  I emphasize the positive outcome of reaching an agreement, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try to get closer to my target of $11,000? I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  It's important to note that selling to John would yield the same amount, but accepting Bob's offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise and build a potential future relationship with him."
