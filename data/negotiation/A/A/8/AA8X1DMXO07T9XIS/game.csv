"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle on $750,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more than that to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
