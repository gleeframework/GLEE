"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can offer you a compromise at $125. Would you be interested in that price?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little higher than my budget. I'm happy to pay $100. It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $100, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
