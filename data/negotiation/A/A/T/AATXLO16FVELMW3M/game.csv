"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This price is fair considering the market value and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, I'm confident this product delivers significant returns beyond the typical market price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I recognize the value you've described, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's aim for a price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer. This price is fair, considering the market value and leaves room for both of us to achieve a positive outcome. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
