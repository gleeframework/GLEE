This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product is only worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting, I'm going to try to get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's finalize this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. While it's still lower than my ideal price, it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
