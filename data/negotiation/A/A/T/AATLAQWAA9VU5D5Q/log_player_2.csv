It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. You can potentially get a better deal than $1,150,000."

You can still try to negotiate a lower price. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,150,000, you're still paying more than the product is worth to Alice. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price of $1,050,000."
