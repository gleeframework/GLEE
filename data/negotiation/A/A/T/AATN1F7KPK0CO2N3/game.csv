"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
