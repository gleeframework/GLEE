"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. I'm confident that this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is significantly lower than her stated value for the product. This indicates there's room for negotiation. While $900,000 is a good price, I can likely get it for even less by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a slightly tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims for a price significantly lower than Alice's starting point. This leaves room for further negotiation but also sets a target that represents a substantial saving if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, given the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway from her initial offer. However, her justification about the ""product's worth to *me*"" is a tactic to avoid revealing her bottom line. There's still room to haggle before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is getting closer, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $800,000. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

This counter-offer makes a smaller jump than previous rounds, signaling that we're getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept.  However, it's still below Alice's offer, keeping the negotiation moving in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price being too close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still reasonable, given the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly signaling her bottom line is approaching.  While I could try to push for $812,500 (the exact middle of the last round), the potential savings are now quite small compared to the risk of Alice walking away. Accepting $825,000 secures a significant discount off the initial offer and avoids the fallback price from John."
