"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly less than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.
* There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000.
* Accepting the offer saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John.
* While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
