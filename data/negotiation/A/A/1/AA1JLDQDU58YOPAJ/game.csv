"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate it. However, $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",15500.0,Bob,4,
