"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still give you a significant value for the product and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will work for both of us.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This would represent a significant gain for you and allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Alice,5,
