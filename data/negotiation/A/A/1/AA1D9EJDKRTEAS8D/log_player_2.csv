**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still give you a significant value for the product and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen!

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit of $800,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice down to my target price."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $925,000 is still above my budget.  While we're getting closer, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  John is offering the product at my maximum price, so it's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
