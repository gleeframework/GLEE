"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider the value of the product and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1350000. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I can see you're willing to pay $1250000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1300000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1300000. However, I'm only willing to go up to this price if you can throw in some extras or concessions. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
