{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unwilling to come close to our budget.  While she might be willing to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll come down enough to make it worthwhile. We have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, and it's better to secure that deal than risk Alice not budging further."
