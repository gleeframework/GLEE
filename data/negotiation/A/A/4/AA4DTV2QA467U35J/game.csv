"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $20,000 for the product. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I need to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $7,500? That's the highest I can go.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $10,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
