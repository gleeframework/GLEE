Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value but above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Shows you are serious:** It's not a lowball offer that might insult Bob and make him walk away.
* **Leaves space for a counteroffer:**  Bob has an incentive to counteroffer, as he sees more value in the product than the price offered.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I will reject his counteroffer and make a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving a bit of room for negotiation. This price demonstrates that I am willing to compromise, while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and the risk of continuing negotiation is high. If I reject this offer, there's a chance he will walk away, or his next offer might be even lower.  At this point, accepting his offer is the best option to secure a profitable sale."
