"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price is $10,000, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go above $11,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope you can accept it.",10750.0,Alice,5,
