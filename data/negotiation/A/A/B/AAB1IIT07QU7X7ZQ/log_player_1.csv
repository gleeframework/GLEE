{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price you'd be willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting point to try and get a higher price. It's a bit above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low, and I think I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $9,500 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate."
