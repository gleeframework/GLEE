"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your budget. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and is within my budget. It also leaves some room for negotiation, as I'm still willing to pay more than John's offer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not willing to budge much from her initial offer. It's clear that we are not going to be able to reach an agreement that is beneficial to both of us.  It's better to cut my losses and purchase the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget and a more favorable price than Alice's final offer."
