Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly below the value of this product. I could come down to $130. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Alice claims this is her ""final offer"".  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 100}
