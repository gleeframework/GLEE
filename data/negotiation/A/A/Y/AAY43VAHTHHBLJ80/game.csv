"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but  $11,500 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
