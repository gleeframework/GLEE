Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high aims to secure the highest possible profit from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still remaining above John's offer.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
