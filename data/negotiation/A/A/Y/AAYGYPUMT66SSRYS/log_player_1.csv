Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  This product is a rare find, and I believe its true value justifies this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

$900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still determined to get closer to my target. I'll try one more counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'll offer you the product for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
