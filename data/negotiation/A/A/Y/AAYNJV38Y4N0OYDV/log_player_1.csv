Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its potential benefits to me. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.

Round 4

Bob is not moving substantially closer to our minimum acceptable price. We've reached a point where the potential gains from continuing with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed sale with John."
