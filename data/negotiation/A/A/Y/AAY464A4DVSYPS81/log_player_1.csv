Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without immediately having to consider selling to John.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to engage.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value. 
* I'm prepared to accept a counteroffer, but I'll be firm in my negotiations.
* I'll use John as a leverage point if Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired range, it still falls below my $1,500,000 minimum.  
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer.  
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* I'll remain firm in my counteroffers, but I'll also be willing to compromise slightly to secure a deal.
* If Bob continues to refuse, I'll ultimately sell to John to ensure I meet my minimum price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,100,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce its worth.
* **Highlighting compromise:**  I emphasize that my offer is a significant concession to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum.
* I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price.
* I'm using a combination of friendly language and firm negotiation tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  
* **No room for further compromise:**  I've already made concessions, and Bob's offer shows he's unwilling to budge significantly.
* **John offers guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum price and secure a profitable deal.

**Strategy:**

* It's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price closer to my desired range.
* I'm choosing to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John.

This is a strategic decision to prioritize my financial goals and avoid further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum price."
