"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I have 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1800000, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000, but I'm not budging from that price. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept $1,600,000, I still have 6 rounds left and believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm also not desperate for the sale and have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only if you raise your offer to $1,700,000.  This leaves us both a bit closer to our desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1550000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  I'll take the $1,500,000 from John and move on."
