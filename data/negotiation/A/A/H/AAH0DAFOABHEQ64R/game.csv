"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1800000, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000, but I'm not budging from that price. Can you meet me in the middle?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1600000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only if you raise your offer to $1700000.  This leaves us both a bit closer to our desired price. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1550000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
