Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate high with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Value Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""incredible value,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing specifics.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about your guaranteed buyer, John. 
* There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a much higher profit outweighs the risk in this scenario."
