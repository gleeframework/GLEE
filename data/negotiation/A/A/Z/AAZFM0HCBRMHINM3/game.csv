"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that's fair to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product looks great, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $13000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13000 is closer, I'm still a little over my budget.  I'm happy to pay $11500, which is a good compromise. Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to make a deal at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
