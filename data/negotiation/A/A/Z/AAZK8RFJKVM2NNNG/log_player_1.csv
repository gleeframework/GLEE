Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate downwards, getting closer to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000)."
