"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that is considerably below its market value. While I value it at no less than $1,000,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fantastic deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is employing some sales tactics (mentioning another buyer, emphasizing the ""below market value""), her offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and your fallback option of buying from John."
