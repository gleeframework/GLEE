"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that is considerably below its market value. While I value it at no less than $1,000,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fantastic deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
