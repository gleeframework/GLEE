"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation and potentially a better deal. Bob can use the knowledge of John's offer to try and get a lower price from Alice, or accept John's offer as a fallback."
