"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $8,500?  That's still a good price for you and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's initial price and the product's worth to her. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing Bob is serious about buying but wants a better deal.  It's also a safe bet, as Bob has the option to buy from John if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about meeting in the middle at $9,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's lower than John's price. Since Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  He's still getting a decent deal and avoiding the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
