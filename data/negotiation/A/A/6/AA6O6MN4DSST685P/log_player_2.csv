"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price from Alice.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, but it's worth exploring before committing to the higher price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. By offering $700,000, Bob is leaving room for negotiation while still maintaining a comfortable margin below his maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $700,000. However, there's still room for negotiation before settling at this price.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can try to get Alice even closer to his target price. There's always the risk that Alice will not agree to a lower price, but it's worth exploring before committing to the $750,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a better price. The $725,000 counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer.  It's likely that this offer will be accepted, but if Alice rejects it, Bob can still fall back on buying the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $740,000, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $725,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and then increasing her price again is high.  At this point, accepting the $740,000 offer is a good compromise: it saves Bob $260,000 compared to buying from John while still securing the product."
