This offer gives me a good starting point to maximize my profit. I'm starting high, but it's still below the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging a response."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
