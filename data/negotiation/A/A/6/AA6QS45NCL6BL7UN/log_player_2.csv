"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I've referenced the product's value to Alice to emphasize a fair deal for both parties.
* **Next steps:**  I'm hoping to find a compromise where we can both walk away happy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's counteroffer is closer to my initial counteroffer and represents a compromise. 
* **Value to me:** The price is still within my budget and significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation might save a bit more, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal or running out of rounds."
