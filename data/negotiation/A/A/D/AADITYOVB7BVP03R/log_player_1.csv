Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is $105, which is higher than my initial offer of $110, but lower than the product's value to him of $120. Since I want to earn as much as I can, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 115}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $105, and the product is worth $120 to him, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer. I'll aim to get closer to the product's value to him.
