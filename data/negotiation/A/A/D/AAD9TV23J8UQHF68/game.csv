"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still above my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and is a fair price considering our mutual benefits.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step closer, it's still below the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting both the product's worth and the potential for a successful partnership.  Let's bridge this gap and finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for everyone.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is a fair offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's unique benefits and the value it brings to your business.  Let's compromise at $940,000. This price allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",940000.0,Alice,5,
