"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. It's a fair price that still gives you a great value for the product, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know if this works for you!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and is within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,000, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you!",13500.0,Alice,5,
