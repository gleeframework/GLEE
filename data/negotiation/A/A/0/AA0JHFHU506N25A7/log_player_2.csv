"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $10,000 to you. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's not the best possible price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering our costs and the value it brings, we would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This allows us to cover our expenses while still being competitive in the market. Would you like to discuss this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a significant improvement from the initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate. He can likely get the price down further with another counteroffer. Buying from John for $12,000 is not a good option at this point, as the negotiation with Alice is progressing well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,250?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to consider a price of $9,375 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our initial offers. Please let us know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $9,375 is a very good price, considering his initial goal was to spend no more than $12,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal for Bob."
