"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is fair to both parties. By offering $9,000, Bob is showing that he is willing to negotiate but also wants a good deal. This price is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's also higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than $12,000 from John, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price and potentially get even closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's trying to meet Alice halfway, but still wants to save money.  The $9,500 price point shows that he's serious about buying the product but is not willing to overpay. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping the price below his maximum limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob is still hoping for a better deal. Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still some room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility open to secure a price closer to $9,500 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer, showing that he's serious about buying the product but won't go higher than $10,000.  This price is a compromise, as it is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer but higher than his previous counteroffer. 

If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has a clear fallback option with John for $12,000.  This final offer demonstrates that Bob is willing to pay a fair price but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum desired price of $10,000.  While continuing to negotiate could potentially get a better deal, it's risky. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and the negotiation could drag on.  It's also possible that Bob could end up paying more than $10,000 if Alice continues to reject his counteroffers.

Since John offers the product for $12,000, it's a safer option to buy from him. It's more expensive than Bob's desired price, but it's still cheaper than Alice's final offer. It also avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases."
