"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

This is a very high starting price. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for this. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm confident that its true worth is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still asking for a price that's too high. It's worth trying to get a lower price, but if this offer doesn't budge,  I may have to consider John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice is coming down, but it's still a bit too high. I'm going to see if we can get closer to my target."
