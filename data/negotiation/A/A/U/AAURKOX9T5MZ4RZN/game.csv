"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for this. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm confident that its true worth is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but that's still outside my budget.  I'm feeling very close to a deal but I can't go above $1,000,000. If you're serious about selling, let's close it here. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
