Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for this. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm confident that its true worth is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter again before accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but that's still outside my budget.  I'm feeling very close to a deal but I can't go above $1,000,000. If you're serious about selling, let's close it here.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee he'll go any higher, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting his offer now secures the $1,000,000."
