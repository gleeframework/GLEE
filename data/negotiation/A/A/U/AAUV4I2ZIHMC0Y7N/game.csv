"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your position, $900000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a fantastic deal for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
