"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $7,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",7200.0,Alice,5,
