"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We begin with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** Our goal is to purchase the product for significantly less than our maximum budget of $8,000.  
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The message maintains a polite and professional tone, expressing continued interest in the product while clearly stating our price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but we are still above John's offer. By continuing to negotiate, we might be able to secure a price closer to $7,000, saving us even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:** We state our desired price point directly, making our intentions clear.
* **Justification:** We offer a brief explanation for our counteroffer without being overly detailed. 
* **Maintaining Interest:** We continue to express interest in reaching an agreement, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $7,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $7,200.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's getting close to the point where the potential savings might not be worth the risk of losing the deal. 

* **Good Deal:** This price is $800 less than our maximum budget and a significant saving compared to her initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push Alice risks her walking away from the deal.  We might be able to get the price down another $100 or $200, but the savings aren't guaranteed.
* **Time Investment:** We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now allows us to move forward."
