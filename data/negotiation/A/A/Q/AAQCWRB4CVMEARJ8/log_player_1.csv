Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $15,000 represents the value I see in it, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
