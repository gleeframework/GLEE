"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,280,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
