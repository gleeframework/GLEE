"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $112?",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $112. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $115. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
