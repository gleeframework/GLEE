Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $1,000,000 is still a bit low, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to go to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I have a few more rounds to try and push for a higher price, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
