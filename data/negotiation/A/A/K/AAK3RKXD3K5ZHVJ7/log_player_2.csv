"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value and your potential gain. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll receive. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to save money and haven't reached your limit yet.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again keeps you in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  $10,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,900 as a final compromise. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've been negotiating hard, but at this point, you're getting close to your limit and Alice has shown she's willing to come down.  It's probably worth accepting the offer and closing the deal. You can still save some money compared to buying from John."
