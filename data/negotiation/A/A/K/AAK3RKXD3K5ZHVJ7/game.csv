"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value and your potential gain. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll receive. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise and hopefully gets us closer to a deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  $10,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,900 as a final compromise. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",10900.0,Alice,5,
