Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a valued potential customer. I think it would be very useful for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product for $12,000 to Bob, there's a chance he might reject it. Aiming slightly lower increases the likelihood of a sale and still nets a significant profit.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning you have another buyer (""valued potential customer"", ""offering this to you first""), you subtly create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is $11,000, there's a slight possibility Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to negotiate closer to your desired price."
