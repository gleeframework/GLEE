"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. Since he knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. Although it is slightly better than her first offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has a few rounds left and there's no reason to rush into a deal that's not the best possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. $10,750 is still below Alice's offer and closer to Bob's ideal price, giving Alice an incentive to accept.  There's still some room to negotiate but Bob needs to be mindful of the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is lowering her price, it's still above Bob's ideal range. Bob is determined to get the best deal possible and wants to continue negotiating to try and push the price down further.  He still has a few rounds left, and rejecting the offer keeps him in the game."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer. This counteroffer shows his willingness to compromise, but he still wants to save as much money as possible. $11,000 is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest one. With only a few rounds remaining, Bob needs to be more assertive in securing a deal while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but he still wants to see if he can get a better deal. He has only a few rounds left and needs to be strategic. Rejecting this offer allows him to potentially get a lower price in the next round.  He can then compare this to John's offer and make the best decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to Alice's offer, and this counteroffer shows his commitment to reaching a deal.  $11,200 is a compromise,  It's slightly higher than his previous offer but still below Alice's latest offer.  This gives Alice a strong incentive to accept,  as rejecting would leave them with only one round left.  Bob needs to be assertive but also mindful of the limited time remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate with Alice.  If he rejects this offer, he'll have to buy from John for $12,000.  While $11,800 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's the best deal he can get at this point. Accepting the offer allows him to secure the product within his budget and avoids the risk of having to pay a higher price to John."
