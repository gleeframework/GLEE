"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we've discussed, this product is worth $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to offer $13,000.  This is a fair price considering your value and my value, and allows us both to make a profitable deal.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $13,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value I place on it is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering our values and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
