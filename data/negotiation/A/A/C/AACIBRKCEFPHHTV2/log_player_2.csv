"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we've discussed, this product is worth $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $13,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value I place on it is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering our values and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
