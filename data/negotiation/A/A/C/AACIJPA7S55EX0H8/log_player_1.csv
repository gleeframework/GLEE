{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts by building a rapport with Bob and acknowledging his potential interest in the product. Offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and proceed with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate the offer, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  Would you be interested in $125?  This would still give you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
