"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider it?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $1200000 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1350000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. Can you consider it?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I can offer you a compromise at $1300000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is the best price for the product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1225000. Can you consider it?,1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $1225000 is still a bit too low for me. I can meet you halfway between $1225000 and my previous offer of $1300000. How about we meet at $1262500?",1262500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1225000 and $1262500, but I think we can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1247500. Can you consider it?",1247500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1247500. I can offer you a slight increase from my previous offer of $1262500. How about we meet at $1275000?",1275000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, Alice. I think we're getting too far apart. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1230000. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1230000.0,Bob,10,
