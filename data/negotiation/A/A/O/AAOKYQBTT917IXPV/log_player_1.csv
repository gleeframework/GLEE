Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value that you'll benefit from."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem less desperate to sell quickly. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $22,000, you're setting a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, his counteroffers will likely be influenced by this high starting point and closer to your desired range.
* **Preserving Value:** You know the product is worth significantly more to you than Bob's perceived value. By starting high, you emphasize the potential value and give yourself room to negotiate down while still making a profit above your minimum.
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of John's offer ($15,000). This allows you to be more firm in your negotiation with Bob, as you're not desperate to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While his counteroffer was expected, accepting it would mean a substantial loss for you. It's time to negotiate further and see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your price point, the value of this product is considerably higher. I could come down to $19,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal happen."", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a significant concession of $3,000 from your initial offer, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps you well above your $15,000 minimum and closer to Bob's initial offer while still leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** You're reinforcing the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's perception. This keeps the negotiation positive and solution-oriented. 
* **Pressure:** By stating it's a ""significant reduction,"" you subtly imply this might be one of your final offers before considering John's deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. It seems unlikely he's willing to move much higher.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. It makes more sense to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
