{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for some back and forth. It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  This is my final offer, so let me know if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $10,000. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the best option at this point."
