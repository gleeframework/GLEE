"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a good starting point as it's within Bob's budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects, but it also demonstrates Bob's seriousness about buying the product. 
* **John's Offer:**  Bob keeps John's offer of $8,000 in mind, but he's willing to go a bit higher with Alice to potentially close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Budget:** While $9,000 is lower than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation:** Bob has successfully negotiated Alice's price down. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get even closer to his target price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $8,000 is a solid fallback, providing Bob with a safety net in case negotiations with Alice fail.

**Strategy:** Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to bring the price down closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  This is my final offer, so let me know if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise, but he's staying within his budget and pushing for a lower price.
* **Finality:** Stating this is his ""final offer"" puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale. 
* **John's Offer:** Bob is staying close to John's offer, but leaving a bit of room in case Alice needs to come down slightly."
