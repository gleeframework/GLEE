"I appreciate your interest, Bob. $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about $92? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there.",92.0,Bob,4,
