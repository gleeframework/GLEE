Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $950,000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that it's a bit above your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
