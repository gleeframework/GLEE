Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $950,000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that it's a bit above your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.
