``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price considering Bob values the product at $8,000 and I need to get at least $12,000. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $12,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum,  I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll counter with a price just slightly lower than my previous offer and see if we can finally reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $9,250 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,375?  This price would allow me to reach a reasonable profit while still providing a great value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9375}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,375. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'm close to getting a deal with Bob,  I've already reached my minimum price with John. I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $12,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
