"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given my own valuation of the product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a meeting point.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm still committed to buying this product, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000.  Let's find a deal!",1050000.0,Bob,4,
