{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob. This is to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  I will then adjust my strategy based on his response.  If he rejects, I will consider his counteroffer and the potential of getting closer to my ideal price. If he's not interested, I can always fall back on the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than my absolute minimum, it's still lower than the value I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also maintaining a good profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would allow me to make this deal work while still giving you a fair price on a product I believe will be valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a price of $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $12,000.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob. This aims to incentivize him to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing a willingness to compromise. This increases the likelihood of a deal while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $13000 as a compromise. This allows us to reach an agreement that respects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price point and is a good compromise.  While I could potentially push for a higher price, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**

Accepting the offer allows me to secure a sale at a good price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation.  The potential of pushing for a higher price is outweighed by the certainty of this deal."
