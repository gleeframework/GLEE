Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob increases his incentive to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to discussion, which keeps the negotiation going. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $90 is better than $80 from John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $120. I'm aiming for a higher price, as the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. He's already shown interest, so I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on my desired value. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a good offer, I need to stay closer to my initial price point.  How about we split the difference?  $105 would be fair to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Fairness:** I'm proposing a middle ground price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $105 is still higher than my minimum price of $80, ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Focused Message:**  I'm keeping the message concise and focused on the price, avoiding unnecessary distractions or lengthy explanations.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our current positions and encourage Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $105 is a good split of the difference. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $95 is only $5 away from my last counteroffer of $105.  This is a reasonable compromise and significantly closer to my desired price than selling to John.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob backing out completely or lowering his offer further. 
* **Time & Effort:**  Negotiations are already taking time, and there's no guarantee of reaching a higher price.  

While I'd prefer a price closer to $105, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
