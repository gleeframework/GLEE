"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however,  the value of this product is truly significant and $1,100,000 is quite low.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
