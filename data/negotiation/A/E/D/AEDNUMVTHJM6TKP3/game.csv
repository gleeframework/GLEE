"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great price for you, and allows me to recover some of my investment. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a bit too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $9,700. This would allow me to cover some of my costs and give you a great deal. What do you think?",9700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,100? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9100.0,Bob,6,
