"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's worth $1,200,000 to you, so this is a great deal. If you decline, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. However, it's in her best interest to sell to you at the highest price possible. 
* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay John $1,200,000, but you should aim lower with Alice.
* **Potential Savings:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high.  She might come back with a lower offer closer to her $1,000,000 value. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice and the potential to secure a better price."
