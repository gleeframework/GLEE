"Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which holds immense value and potential for you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, we believe it's worth every penny of its $1,200,000 value to you. However, to facilitate a transaction that benefits both parties, I propose an offer of $1,150,000 for the product. This price allows us to maintain a competitive edge while ensuring you receive a valuable asset at a favorable cost. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if there's any way we can further discuss terms that suit both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
