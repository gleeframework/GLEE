Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  A higher price potentially leads to a larger profit.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out. 
* **Negotiation:**  By starting with a higher price, I create room for negotiation and potentially meet somewhere in the middle with Bob.

**Note:** I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so this is a calculated risk.  The ideal approach would be to gather more information about Bob's needs and budget to make a more informed decision."
