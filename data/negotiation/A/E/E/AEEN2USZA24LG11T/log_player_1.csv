"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $10,000 gives Bob some wiggle room to counteroffer without feeling like the deal is too far off. 

Remember, this is just the first round.  I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and keep the goal of maximizing my earnings in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is above minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $8,000, so there's potential to do better.
* **More rounds to go:**  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, giving me time to explore if I can reach a higher price.  
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:** I'll need to carefully consider how much to counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price that is both appealing to Bob and allows me to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,500 is a good offer, I'm hoping for a little closer to my original asking price.  How about $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight decrease:**  I've lowered my price slightly, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair compromise:** $9,750 is a reasonable midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, making it more likely that Bob will accept.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, emphasizing its potential for him.

**Next steps:** I'll be prepared to adjust my counteroffer if necessary, but I'm hopeful that this offer will be accepted. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting the price, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  Bob's offer of $9,600 is only $150 less than my previous counteroffer. This is a very good price, considering I'm aiming to maximize my earnings. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal with too many rounds left.  
* **Potential for more negotiation:** While accepting this offer is my best option, there's still room for a slight counteroffer if I'm not happy with this price. However, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.

**Next steps:**  I'll need to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate against the potential to reach a higher price. However, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
