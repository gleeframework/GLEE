{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a competitive price point."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it slightly below Alice's minimum ($15,000) might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $15,000. This allows Alice to be slightly bolder with her initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $14,999. He might try to negotiate further. Alice needs to decide her walk-away point and be prepared to sell to John if Bob's counter-offers are too low."
