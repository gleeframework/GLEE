"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting high, knowing that my product is worth significantly more to me than Bob. 
* This establishes a strong starting point and gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* By offering a price higher than my minimum, I leave some space for compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction to this initial offer. If he rejects it, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. I'll always be prepared to accept a lower price if it's closer to my minimum or if it's becoming too risky to continue negotiating. However, I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* I have 8 rounds left, which provides me with room to explore better deals.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than $1,200,000, to gauge his willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.  If he continues to be stubborn, I'll reassess my options, including selling to John, as the rounds continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise. This is still well above Bob's offer of $850,000.
* This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my desired price range.

**Strategy:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll continue to lower my price gradually in subsequent rounds, but I'll always keep in mind the option of selling to John if it becomes clear that a deal with Bob is unlikely.  I will remain flexible but determined to get the best possible price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is still below my desired price of $1,000,000. While it's getting closer, selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a guaranteed profit and I'm not entirely confident in my ability to reach a satisfactory price with Bob.
* I have 6 rounds left, and I believe that a better offer might be possible. 
* I want to see how much higher Bob is willing to go, and if he's showing genuine interest in closing the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still above $900,000. This will allow me to gauge his true willingness to compromise. If his offers continue to be below $1,000,000, I'll be more inclined to accept John's offer to ensure a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price again, but this time it's just a small decrease from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at his price.
* This price is still above Bob's offer of $900,000 and is getting closer to the $1,000,000 I can get from John. 
* By offering a price that's closer to my minimum, I'm putting pressure on Bob to either accept or make a more substantial counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer carefully. If it's still significantly below $1,000,000, I'll likely accept John's offer to ensure a guaranteed profit. However, if Bob shows signs of moving closer to my desired price, I'll continue negotiating with him, hoping to find a deal that's more favorable than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* While I have 4 rounds left, I'm not confident that I can push Bob further to meet my price point. 
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my minimum, which is a more secure and profitable choice at this point.

**Strategy:**

I've been trying to negotiate with Bob, but the gap between our desired prices hasn't closed sufficiently. Time is running out, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed profit from John. By selling to John, I'm ensuring a good outcome and avoiding the potential for further negotiation failures with Bob."
