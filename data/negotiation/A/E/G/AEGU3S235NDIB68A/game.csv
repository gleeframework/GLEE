"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit high for me. How about $105?  I'm hoping to find a deal that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $112. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
