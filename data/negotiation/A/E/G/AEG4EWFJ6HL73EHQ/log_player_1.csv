Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, but the initial price sets a high bar. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I can adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is still a decent profit, it's not the best I can get. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm not going too low.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, suggesting I'm open to a middle ground. 

This counteroffer aims to find a happy medium between my desired price and Bob's budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is a fair compromise, close to my previous counteroffer of $13,000. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  While I could try for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation dragging on or Bob walking away entirely is too high.
* **Securing a decent profit:**  $12,500 is a good profit, exceeding my minimum requirement of $10,000 and giving me some breathing room. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of a drawn-out negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
