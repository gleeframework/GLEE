{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Description] that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point above your minimum price of $15,000. It allows for negotiation but still gives you a good starting point.
* **Product Description:** This is crucial! Be specific about what you're selling to pique Bob's interest and make it clear why it might be worth $20,000 to him. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Starting with a friendly greeting and a positive message sets a good tone for the negotiation. 

**Remember:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and be flexible throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $8000?  I'm really interested in the [Product Description] and that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's not worth selling the product for such a low price, especially since you have a guaranteed sale to John for a higher amount. 

**Next Steps:**

You will now make a counteroffer to Bob. Since you know John is willing to pay $15,000, you should aim for a price closer to that value. A counteroffer around $17,000-$18,000 would be reasonable, leaving room for negotiation but still getting you closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This would still give you a great deal on a [Product Description] that will be worth its weight in gold. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** $17,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but is still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This leaves room for negotiation but positions you for a better outcome. 
* **Positive Messaging:** Even though you rejected Bob's offer, you're still maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  You're reminding Bob of the value of the product to emphasize why your counteroffer is still a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

Now you need to wait for Bob's response.  He can either accept your counteroffer, make a new counteroffer, or walk away. Be prepared to adjust your strategy depending on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17000 but I'm still not quite there.  How about $12000?  That's a good compromise and I'm confident I can make this work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still not enough. You have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, which is a much better deal. There's no need to risk lowering your price further, especially since Bob might continue to offer lower amounts in future rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

You will now make another counteroffer to Bob.  Since you have a backup buyer, you can be a bit more firm.  A counteroffer between $14,000-$14,500 might be a good starting point.  This will show Bob that you are willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows you to get a great deal on a [Product Description] that will be very valuable to you. Let's finalize this and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and your minimum acceptable price. It shows you're willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Highlighting Value:**  You're reminding Bob of the value of the product, emphasizing that $14,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, aiming to close the deal without appearing too stubborn.

**Next Steps:**

This is likely to be a crucial counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, you'll have to decide whether to stick with John's offer or try to negotiate further. Keep in mind the risk of going lower and the potential of losing out on a sale to John."
