Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you won't regret it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $120 because I can sell it to John for that price.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **Finding a compromise:** I'm offering $100, which is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob a good deal, while still allowing me to earn more than if I sold it to John."
