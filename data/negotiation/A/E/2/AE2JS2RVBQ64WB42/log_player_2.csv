"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that might be closer to your acceptable range. If not, you can always fall back on purchasing from John at a price that works best for you."
