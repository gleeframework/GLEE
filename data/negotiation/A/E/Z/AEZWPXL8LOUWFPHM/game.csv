"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's the most I'm able to pay at this time.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,5,
