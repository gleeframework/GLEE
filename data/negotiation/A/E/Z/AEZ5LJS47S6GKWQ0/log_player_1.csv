Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a price of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation and anchors the value higher in Bob's mind. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""time-sensitive"" offer might encourage Bob to act quickly, potentially accepting a higher price than he would with no pressure.
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth $12,000. This allows Bob to justify the price based on his perceived value and your persuasive language.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both parties while maximizing Alice's profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the security of selling to John for her minimum price."
