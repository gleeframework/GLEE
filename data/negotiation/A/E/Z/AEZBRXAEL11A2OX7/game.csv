"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $105 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $130. It's a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $115. This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $125. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at $125, I'm open to discussing the deal further. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
