"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm eager to work with you, $1,300,000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price still reflects the product's immense value and leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
