"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a substantial gain over my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my ideal price. I'll reject and see if I can squeeze out a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm raising the price a bit, trying to meet Bob halfway. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob seems stuck at $1,300,000.  I'll reject his offer again and see if I can convince him to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm increasing the price by a smaller margin this time, showing a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit.  If Bob continues to stall at $1,300,000, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob has been stubborn.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely.  Selling to John would only net me $1,200,000, so this is a better option."
