Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but potentially negotiable from his perspective allows room for bargaining. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at high demand (""interest I've had"") to justify the price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the tone remains open for discussion, increasing the chance Bob might counter-offer instead of outright rejecting. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
