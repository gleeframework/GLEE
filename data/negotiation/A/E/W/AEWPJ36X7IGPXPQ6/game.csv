"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget concerns. While $100 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm open to a slight compromise. How about $110? This would allow me to make a small profit while still giving you a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I'm still hoping to keep the price at or below $100. Could we perhaps aim for $105? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
