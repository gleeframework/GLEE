{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. He wants to pay no more than $8,000, and Alice's offer is higher. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is just too far below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8,800?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $8,700. That's a significant compromise on my end. I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, he's still only $200 away from his goal, and John is offering the product for his desired price. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before going with John."
