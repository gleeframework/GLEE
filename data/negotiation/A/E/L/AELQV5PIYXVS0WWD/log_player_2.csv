"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000, which is still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000. 
* **John's price:** $15,000, which is Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:** Reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. 

By rejecting the initial offer, Bob maintains the option of buying from John if negotiation fails.  He can also try to secure a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Still saving as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $14,000, which is above Bob's maximum price.
* **John's price:**  $15,000, which is Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer but leaves room for further negotiation. It's a starting point that shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $12,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000, which is still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000. 
* **John's price:** $15,000, which is Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:** Reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating. 

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  There's still room to negotiate further, and by rejecting, Bob keeps the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little too high.  Let's split the difference at $12,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000, which is still above Bob's maximum price.
* **John's price:** $15,000, which is Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway.  It shows Bob's willingness to negotiate but also keeps him within his budget.  It's a good move to test Alice's willingness to further decrease the price."
