"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation we've had so far. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
