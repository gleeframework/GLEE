"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we aim to establish a negotiating range that works in our favor. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves space for counteroffers and potential compromise while still staying below our $10,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message remains courteous while clearly stating our price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our price range, but we can still try to push a little further.  She's clearly motivated to sell, and we have John's offer as a backup if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're meeting Alice halfway between her current offer ($10,500) and our previous offer ($9,000). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  Our offer remains under our $10,000 maximum, ensuring we don't overspend.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a specific price rather than another round of broad negotiation, we're subtly encouraging a quicker decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now quite small. While we *could* try another counteroffer, the potential savings are minimal and there's a risk Alice might dig in her heels. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed savings of John's offer."
