"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
