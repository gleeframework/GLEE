"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $108. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it, considering the value it will bring to you!",108.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $112. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",112.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'm going to meet you at $106. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product.",106.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me at a reasonable price, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $106. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $120, but I'll make one last offer to you. I'll pay $96 for the product. This is my final offer.",96.0,Bob,10,
