Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. What do you think?,175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider my other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $100.  It's the absolute maximum I can pay, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. It's worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $112.50. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",112.5,Alice,7,
