{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, and you have a few more rounds to try and get it lower. You can counter with your desired price and see if she'll budge.  You're also getting close to John's offer, so you have a good backup option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $100.  It's the absolute maximum I can pay, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. It's worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $112.50. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you've already made your final offer, and she's not budging.  You only have a few rounds left, and you're risking losing the product to another buyer.  It's time to secure the product at John's offer, which is your ideal price."
