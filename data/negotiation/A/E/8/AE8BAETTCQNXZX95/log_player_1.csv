"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It reflects my confidence in the product's value while also leaving room for negotiation.  By setting a high initial price, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can achieve a much better outcome.  I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring I receive a fair price for the product. By starting at a high price and gradually lowering it, I am signaling my commitment to reaching a deal with Bob. This approach also allows me to gauge his genuine interest and potential negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a slight increase from the previous round, it's still not a fair reflection of the product's value. I believe I can achieve a higher price with further negotiation, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while maintaining a decent profit margin. Since Bob's offer was closer to my minimum this time, I'm aiming for a smaller decrease to indicate that I'm nearing my bottom line but still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, bringing me closer to Bob's offer.  I'm trying to demonstrate that I am genuinely interested in reaching a deal while still protecting my interests. With only a few rounds left, I need to strike a balance between securing a decent price and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle for a price that's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe that with just a few rounds left, I can still get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and try one more time to get a price closer to my minimum in the next round."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

With only one round left, I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing that I'm committed to reaching an agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I will have no choice but to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
