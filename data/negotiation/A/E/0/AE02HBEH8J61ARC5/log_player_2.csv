"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate to try to get a lower price from Alice. $10,000 is still a significant markup from her perspective."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Establish a reasonable starting point:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer creates room for negotiation.
* **Remain respectful and polite:**  Expressing interest and thanking Alice maintains a positive tone.
* **Avoid revealing my maximum budget:** I don't want to show my hand too early. 

Let's see how Alice responds to this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good.  However, $8,500 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm afraid it's still a little beyond my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm ready to make a deal today at that price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** Acknowledging Alice's movement on price demonstrates flexibility.
* **Hold firm on the budget:**  Reiterating the budget limitation reinforces my position.
* **Introduce a sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""today"" adds a bit of pressure for Alice to close the deal. 

Let's see if we can land somewhere between $7,000 and $8,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,500?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice is meeting me right in the middle, and $7,500 is a significant savings compared to her initial offer. It's also better than John's price.  It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
