Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I believe there's potential to get closer to my initial asking price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price expectations, and his latest offer is below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale altogether.  I'll take John's offer of $8,000."
