"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to get closer to $1,400,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you consider $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and also allows you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
