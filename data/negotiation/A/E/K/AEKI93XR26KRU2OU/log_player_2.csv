"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is closer to the product's worth to Alice.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it leaves room for Alice to make a small profit while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than the product's worth to her, and it's still above Bob's desired price.  It's unlikely that Alice will significantly lower her offer, but Bob should continue to try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of finding a price closer to Alice's bottom line. $8,750 represents a compromise, offering a higher price than Bob's previous counteroffer but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This might encourage Alice to accept as it's a reasonable middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,750 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he wants to pay.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, especially since he has five rounds left and can always choose to buy from John. It's likely that Alice will be more willing to negotiate as the rounds continue and she gets closer to her deadline."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to show he's willing to compromise.  $9,000 is still below Alice's current offer and closer to his desired price point. This is a strategic move to gauge if Alice is getting more motivated to close the deal with Bob rather than risk him buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is getting close to Bob's budget, he still has time to try and negotiate a better price.  He has 3 rounds left and can always buy from John. It's worth risking another round to see if Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, but still keeping it below Alice's current offer. $9,250 is a compromise, showing that Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway.  This is a gamble, as there are only two rounds left. However,  if Alice rejects this offer, Bob can always fall back on buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,950 is still too high for Bob. He has only one round left, and it's unlikely that Alice will lower her price enough to make it worth his while. It's better for Bob to buy from John for $12,000, as he has already reached the point where he can't get a significantly better deal from Alice."
