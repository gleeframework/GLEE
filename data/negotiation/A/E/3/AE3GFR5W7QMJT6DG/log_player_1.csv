Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still aiming for a good profit. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a bit more than $80. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $90.  It's a great deal for such a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. I'm still trying to make a profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and desire for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $85 is only $5 more than John's offer, it's still a profit for me and avoids the risk of Bob completely backing out or me having to continue negotiating."
