# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,080,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial asking price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
