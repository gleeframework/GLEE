"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,080,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
