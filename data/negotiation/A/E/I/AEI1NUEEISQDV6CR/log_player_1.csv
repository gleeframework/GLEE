Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique product, and I believe this offer reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity to justify the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I still gain the full value from John.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the highest possible profit from Bob while having a reliable backup plan with John."
