You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better deal than John's $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My maximum budget is $12,000, so I'm offering the lowest price possible. This gives Alice a chance to accept and still make a profit, while also being the best deal for me."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. Since John is willing to sell the product for my maximum price, I'll go ahead and buy it from him to ensure I get the best possible deal."
