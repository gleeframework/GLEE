"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value of $800,000 and my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account both our values. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price point of $850,000. 
* **Time is valuable:**  It's only round 3, and Bob has plenty of time left to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for a better deal is low:** Alice is already offering a price that's fairly close to her minimum. Continuing to haggle could result in a stalemate or even Alice walking away.
* **Buying from John is still an option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, he can always buy from John, but that would cost him more.

**Overall:** It's a good deal for Bob to accept, saving him $125,000 compared to buying from John."
