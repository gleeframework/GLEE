"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value of $800,000 and my maximum budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account both our values.",875000.0,Alice,3,
