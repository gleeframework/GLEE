"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
