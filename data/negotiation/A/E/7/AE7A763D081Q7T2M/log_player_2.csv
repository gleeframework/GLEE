# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, $17,000 is still over Bob's budget. He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."
