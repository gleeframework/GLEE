# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm offering it to you for $125. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product from John for $100, which is less than Alice's offer of $125. So, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
