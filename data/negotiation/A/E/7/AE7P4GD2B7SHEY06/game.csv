"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and a great starting point for us to move forward.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value it holds for you.
