"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value, I believe it's worth $95 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  Rejecting allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's valuation of the product.  This shows I'm serious about buying it, but I'm also trying to get a fair deal.  $85 is a good middle ground that gives Alice a decent profit while still allowing me to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can reach an agreement. I am willing to sell the product for $90. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but it's still above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to try to get a lower price in the next round.  I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and there's no point in settling for a price that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $85. Would you consider $87? It's a fair price that would allow both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer again shows a willingness to compromise. It's only a small increase from my previous offer, but it demonstrates that I'm serious about finding a solution. It also leaves room for Alice to counter back if she's not ready to settle on that price yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to sell the product for $88. This price allows us to both benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $88, which is within my budget and only slightly above my previous offer. I'm comfortable with this price, and I'm happy to accept and close the deal.  It's a good price that allows me to save money, and it also avoids the risk of losing the product to another seller or running out of rounds for negotiation."
