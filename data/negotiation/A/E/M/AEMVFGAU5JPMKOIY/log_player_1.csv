{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's valuation but still allows for some wiggle room in case he counteroffers. It also shows I'm open to negotiation and willing to work with him.  I'm confident that Bob will be more likely to accept an offer that is closer to his valuation than a much higher one, and I can still make a profit. If he rejects, I'm ready to counter-offer and see where we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum valuation of $120. While it's closer to my initial offer, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to try and counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is closer to my initial offer, it's still below my minimum value for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum valuation, it's still below it. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, I can get a price closer to my target. However, if this counteroffer is also rejected, I'll sell to John."
