"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is already a significant discount on what it's worth to me. How about we settle at $19,000? That's me trying to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, I still cannot go above $15,000 for this product. Would you consider lowering your price to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is firm at $15,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a better outcome. Since John is offering $15,000, it makes the most sense to take the guaranteed sale and avoid further negotiation rounds."
