# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You stand to save a considerable amount ($4,000) by going with John."
