"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $12,000. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for it. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to suggest a price of $10,500 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while being competitive in the market. I look forward to your consideration of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $12,000 and John is selling the product for $12,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely to get a better price than $10,500."
