Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?,130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still looking for a compromise, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $132.50. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
