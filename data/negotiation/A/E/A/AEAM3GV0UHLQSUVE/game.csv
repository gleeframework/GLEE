,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $150? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
