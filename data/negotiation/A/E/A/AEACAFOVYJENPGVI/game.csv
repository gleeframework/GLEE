"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
