I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'll aim to get closer to that price. Let's say I'll offer Bob the product for $115.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106

I've already reached my minimum acceptable price of $112, and Bob's offer is below that. I think it's time to sell the product to John, who is willing to pay the full $120.
