"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit.  There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is tempting and closer to Bob's limit, it's still a bit above his target.  There's a chance Alice will come down further, and Bob can still secure the product from John for $10,000 if the negotiation doesn't go his way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer of $13,500, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial $12,000 offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,750. This would allow both of us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as high as $12,750. I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer the product to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. While Alice is getting closer to his target price, the negotiation is becoming time-consuming and the risk of not closing a deal is increasing.  It's best for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $10,000. He will be able to get the product for a price that fits his budget and avoid any further negotiation fatigue."
