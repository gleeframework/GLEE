Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but it also shows I believe in the value of the product. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. This hopefully demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product has value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll counter again, but I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum and shows I'm willing to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not comfortable selling for that price, especially after so many rounds of negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better deal for me."
