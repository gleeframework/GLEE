"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I can meet you in the middle at $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10000. This is a compromise between our previous offers. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go to $10000. I'm willing to come down to $11000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10500. This is my final offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can meet you at $11250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10200. This is my final offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10200, Bob. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to think you're not willing to meet me at a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to think about selling to John at $12000 if you're not willing to meet me in the middle. My final offer is $10750. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10000.
