Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to exploring options that lead to a mutually agreeable outcome."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for showcasing the product. While I agree it has potential, the current asking price is significantly above my budget. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $500,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  We have plenty of room to negotiate and John's offer provides a strong fallback position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product offers significantly more potential than your initial offer reflects. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price better represents the true value and potential benefits it brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you adjusting the price. However, the gap between our valuations is still substantial. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging my budget constraints.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still very far apart.  It's time to test his seriousness by increasing the price and gauging his reaction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be completely transparent, the value this product represents to me is far closer to my original asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is a significant adjustment on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but that price remains outside my realistic budget.  To be frank, I'm only prepared to go as high as $800,000. If that's not workable for you, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but Bob has now revealed his maximum valuation. While we could try to push him a little further, there's a significant risk he walks away. Accepting $800,000 is a sure win, whereas continuing the negotiation could result in a lower final price or even losing the sale to Bob altogether."
