"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs.

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at $1,400,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm counteroffering $1,520,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,520,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. I believe this price is fair considering your minimum price and my budget, and it allows us to reach a deal. Let's find common ground.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $1,450,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $1,480,000. This is the final concession I can make, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1480000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm sure we can reach a deal that's mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to offer $1,460,000 for the product.  It's only a small step from your offer, and it allows us to close this deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation. Let's make this happen.",1460000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,460,000. I'm starting to get close to my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm counteroffering $1,480,000 again, which is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1480000.0,Alice,9,
