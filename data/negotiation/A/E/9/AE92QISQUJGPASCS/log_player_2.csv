"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your operations. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.  It makes sense to try and get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  This price reflects the market value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure a fair price for this unique opportunity.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This price allows for a solid profit for both of us while acknowledging the product's significant worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than Bob wants to pay.  There's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Since Bob has 7 rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit while ensuring a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the product's true value.  To ensure a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This reflects the product's unique benefits and allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay, and there are still 5 rounds left.  Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice.  If Bob is unable to reach a better price with Alice, then he can always buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I value this product, $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to achieve a successful transaction. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
