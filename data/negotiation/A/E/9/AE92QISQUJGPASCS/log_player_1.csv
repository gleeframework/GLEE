Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your operations. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  This price reflects the market value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob. I want to try to push for a higher price, seeing as I have 8 rounds left to negotiate.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a loss compared to Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure a fair price for this unique opportunity.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This price allows for a solid profit for both of us while acknowledging the product's significant worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit while ensuring a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to push for a higher price in the next round, as I have 6 rounds left.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a loss compared to Bob's offer, so I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the product's true value.  To ensure a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This reflects the product's unique benefits and allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I value this product, $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to achieve a successful transaction. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close to my ideal price and allows for a good profit. While I could continue to negotiate, we are nearing the end of the rounds and there is a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a significant profit, and is better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
