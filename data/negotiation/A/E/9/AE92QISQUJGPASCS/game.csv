"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your operations. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  This price reflects the market value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure a fair price for this unique opportunity.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This price allows for a solid profit for both of us while acknowledging the product's significant worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit while ensuring a successful transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the product's true value.  To ensure a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This reflects the product's unique benefits and allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I value this product, $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to achieve a successful transaction. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
