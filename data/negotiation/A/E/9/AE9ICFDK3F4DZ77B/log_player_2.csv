"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with her, as you have 10 rounds to potentially get a better price.  Buying from John right now is the safest option, but you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but Alice has a strong incentive to sell to me since her valuation is much higher. If she rejects this offer, I'll still have 8 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price. Buying from John is always an option, but I'd like to see if I can save some more money by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to come down from her initial price.  I'm increasing my offer by $200,000, showing I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a good deal. I'm also aware that the more rounds we go through, the higher the chance she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still too high. I'm confident I can get a better deal with more negotiation.  I have 5 rounds left, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice.  If her next offer is unreasonable, I'll always have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting closer to my price point. I'm increasing my offer again by $200,000, showing good faith and willingness to compromise.  However, I believe that $1,400,000 is a fair price for both of us. This offer is well within my budget and leaves room for Alice to still profit from the deal. If she rejects, I'll still have 4 rounds left to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, I still have room to negotiate and potentially save more money. This deal is still too expensive for me, and I'm willing to risk the remaining rounds to see if I can get a better price.  I'm also aware that Alice is probably feeling the pressure to sell as we are approaching the end of the negotiation. If her next offer is still too high, I'll have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget, but I want to try one last counteroffer before considering buying from John.  $1,500,000 is a fair price that represents a good compromise for both of us. It leaves some room for Alice to still profit from the deal, while allowing me to stay within my budget. With only two rounds left, this counteroffer is a calculated risk. If Alice rejects, I'll have to decide between her final offer and buying from John."
