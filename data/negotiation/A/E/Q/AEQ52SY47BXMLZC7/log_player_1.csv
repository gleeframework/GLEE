"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob.  I'm aiming high, knowing that I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum.  I'm also trying to make it clear to Bob that this is a good deal for him, even at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is still a good profit for you, and it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm not going to accept it at this point, but I am going to continue negotiating. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,475,000? That still gives you a significant profit, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,475,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but his offer is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm getting concerned about the time limit. I'll try to get a better deal, but I might have to accept a lower price soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. This is a great deal for you, and I'm giving you my best price. Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get a better deal.  I only have 4 rounds left before I have to make a decision about selling to John, so I need to be careful about how much I'm willing to concede."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and go down to $1,387,500.  This is my final counteroffer.  If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to sell to someone else."", ""product_price"": 1387500}
