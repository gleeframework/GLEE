Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can consider.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we possibly agree on $11,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,500 is cutting it too close.  How about we settle on $15,500?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $12,000.  This is my final offer - it's a fair price and a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $12,000 is his absolute limit. While we could try to negotiate further, it's highly unlikely we'll bridge the gap between his offer and our minimum price ($15,000).  Therefore, it's in our best interest to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
