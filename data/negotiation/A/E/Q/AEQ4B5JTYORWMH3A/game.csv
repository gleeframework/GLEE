"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can consider.  This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we possibly agree on $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,500 is cutting it too close.  How about we settle on $15,500?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $12,000.  This is my final offer - it's a fair price and a good deal for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
