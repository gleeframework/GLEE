"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming closer to my budget, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a little steep for me. Would you be willing to do $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is my final offer for this round, but I'm open to negotiations.",8500.0,Alice,5,
