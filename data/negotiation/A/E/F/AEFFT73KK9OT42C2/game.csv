"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity for you to capitalize on its full potential. I'm confident it will be worth every penny. My initial price is $1,750,000. This is a fair starting point, given the product's value and the benefits it offers.

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the product's worth and my financial situation.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
