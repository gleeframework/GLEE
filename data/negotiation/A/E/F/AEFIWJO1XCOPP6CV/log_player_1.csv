{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to negotiate.  It also leaves room for me to potentially lower the price if necessary, while still making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being more in line with your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
