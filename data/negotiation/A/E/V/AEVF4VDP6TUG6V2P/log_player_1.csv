Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our minimum acceptable price.  We want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. We need to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $1,350,000:
    * Provides a potential profit of $150,000 over John's offer.
    * Gives us room to negotiate down towards Bob's valuation if needed. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
