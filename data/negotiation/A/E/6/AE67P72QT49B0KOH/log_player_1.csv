"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price of $1,200,000. This sets a clear baseline and gives Bob some room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh it against the option of selling to John for the full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate but not at such a drastic discount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more acceptable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial counteroffer. This compromise demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to keep pushing for a better deal.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob but will also consider selling to John if I don't see progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,050,000.  This shows flexibility and acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate, but it's still a price that's higher than his last offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also running out of time. If we don't make significant progress in the next few rounds, I will consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a better price and avoiding a stalemate.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a middle ground to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer hasn't reached my minimum acceptable price. I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he may become frustrated and walk away entirely. While I'd prefer to secure a higher price, I'm confident that John will pay the full amount. It's time to cut my losses and ensure a guaranteed sale."
