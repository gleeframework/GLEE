"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob.

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to try to reach a more favorable price.  I still have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to his offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counter-offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a decent price and not letting the negotiation drag on too long. My goal is to close the deal in a reasonable number of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars.  I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 still doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and get closer to a deal.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing:** I'm suggesting we finalize the deal, subtly putting pressure on Bob to accept.

With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to close the deal while leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases with each round.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150.  This guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
