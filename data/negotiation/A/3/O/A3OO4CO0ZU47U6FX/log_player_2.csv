"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $12,000 to us due to its unique features and high-quality craftsmanship. Given that you find this product worth $8,000 to you, I propose we strike a deal that benefits both of us. How about offering it to you for $9,500? This price reflects the value we place on the product while allowing you to acquire it at a reasonable cost. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's lower than her initial valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for a better price from John."
