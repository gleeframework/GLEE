,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
