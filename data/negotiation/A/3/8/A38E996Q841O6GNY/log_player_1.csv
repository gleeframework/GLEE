"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't afford $14,000. Could you consider reducing the price to $13,000? This would allow me to make the purchase within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's still a great price for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
