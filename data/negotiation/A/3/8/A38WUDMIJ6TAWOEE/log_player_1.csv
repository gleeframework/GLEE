Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $19,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher number.  Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it's likely any counter-offer he makes will still be closer to $19,000 than his perceived value of $10,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I don't explicitly mention John, but the phrase ""before I list it publicly"" subtly implies that I have other options if Bob doesn't meet my price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob, but I won't go below my minimum of $15,000 knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer."
