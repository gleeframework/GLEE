Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $100, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for Bob to feel good:** Offering $125 gives Bob a potential ""win"" if he negotiates you down even a little. This can make him more likely to engage.
* **Above Bob's value, below your safety net:**  This price ensures that if Bob accepts, you earn more than the guaranteed $150 from John. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters!"
