"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your insights, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value this product holds is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,225,000. I believe that's a fair reflection of its potential.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably land.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $1,162,500.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for you to make a profit.",1162500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right that we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer I need to consider, so I'm at my final price point. I could let it go for $1,193,750. This is a difficult decision for me, as I truly believe in the value of this product for you.",1193750.0,Alice,5,
