"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $10,050 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There is still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for the possibility of a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Appealing to Value:** I reiterate the value proposition, reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language like ""fair price"" and ""meeting in the middle"" to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,000. I was thinking more like $9,500. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to move closer, the gap between our positions is still substantial.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees a significant profit, while continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a higher risk of getting stuck with a much lower price.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob within the limited timeframe is increasing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Chance Compromise:** This is my final attempt to bridge the gap and reach a deal with Bob. It's a significant compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I highlight the value of the product and present the offer as fair for both of us.
* **Clear Deadline:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **Time Constraints:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to ensure a deal is reached soon.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling the product to John for $15,000. The risk of reaching a mutually beneficial deal with Bob is becoming increasingly high, and the guaranteed profit from John is becoming more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to only 4 rounds remaining, and the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough.
* **Limited Upside:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, the potential for reaching a truly profitable deal with him is dwindling.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a significant profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable value and considerably higher than anything I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.

While I'd prefer to maximize my profit, the risk of reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob within the remaining rounds is too high.  Selling to John ensures a secure and substantial outcome."
