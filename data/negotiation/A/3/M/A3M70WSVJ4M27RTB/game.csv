"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10050.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,000. I was thinking more like $9,500. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. That's the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,6,
