I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $115? I think that's a fair compromise.,115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd hate to lose this opportunity. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
