Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible to maximize her profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that the offer is significantly higher than John's $12,000 offer to ensure Alice doesn't lose potential profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a high price and having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
