"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a compromise that satisfies both parties. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that we also respect the value I place on the product. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $13,500. This price reflects a midpoint between our initial offers, allowing for a fair transaction. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and look forward to your feedback.",13500.0,Alice,3,
