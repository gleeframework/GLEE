"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to maintain a fair transaction. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your proposal, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $13,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a compromise that satisfies both parties. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that we also respect the value I place on the product. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $13,500. This price reflects a midpoint between our initial offers, allowing for a fair transaction. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and look forward to your feedback.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer of $13,000.  Accepting this offer will save Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would only result in minor price adjustments, and the risk of losing the deal with Alice isn't worth it for a potential small gain."
