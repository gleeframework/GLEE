Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I can always sell to John for that amount, there's no reason to go lower right away. This gives Bob the opportunity to either accept and make me happy, or counter with a lower price which we can then negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a price of $115. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer. I hope this is enticing enough for him to accept, but I'm still willing to negotiate if needed."
