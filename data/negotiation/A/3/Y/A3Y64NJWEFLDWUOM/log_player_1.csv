Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I really need to stay within my limits. Can you consider meeting me at $9,200? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget constraints.

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his current offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk Bob not increasing his offer substantially."
