"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a great deal for both of us. If you decline, I will have to sell it to another buyer for a lower price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your value:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her selling to another buyer for a lower price means it's better to accept the current offer and secure the deal."
