"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $10,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob can likely get a better deal than $9,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price, considering the market value of the product is $10,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob is getting the product for $800 less than his maximum price. While he could try to get a lower price, it is not guaranteed that Alice will accept, and the time spent in negotiations could be better used elsewhere. Accepting the offer and buying the product from Alice is the best option for Bob."
