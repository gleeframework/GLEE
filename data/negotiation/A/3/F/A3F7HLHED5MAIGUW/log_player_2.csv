"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high value and the benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you at an exclusive price of $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored specifically for you, considering the substantial worth this product holds for you at $15,000. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $12,000.  By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her actual valuation. 

Even if Alice doesn't budge, you still have the option to buy from John for $15,000. It's always better to explore negotiation before resorting to a backup plan."
