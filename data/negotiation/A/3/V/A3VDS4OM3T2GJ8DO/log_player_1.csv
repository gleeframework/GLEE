"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value, we establish a firm position and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line, encouraging Bob to engage seriously. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, we're still well above our minimum acceptable price, giving us flexibility in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below his perceived value of the product. While it's above our absolute minimum, we have plenty of room for negotiation and rounds left.  Rejecting this offer shows Bob we're serious about getting a fair price and encourages him to move closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and interest, maintaining a positive negotiation environment.
* **Firm Stance:** We clearly state his offer is too low but express willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Strategic Movement:**  We've come down $100,000, which is significant but keeps us well within a profitable range. This signals we're negotiating but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I value the product, I need to stay within a certain budget.  Would you consider $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate.  However, we're still in early rounds, and the offer is significantly below our target. Rejecting keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to our acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Significant Concession:** We've made a $50,000 concession, demonstrating a willingness to move towards Bob's price range.
* **Strong Position:** $1,250,000 is a strong midpoint between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffers. It signals our desire to close the deal but not at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about $1,200,000 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit margin above our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offers, indicating a strong desire for the product. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us misjudging the remaining rounds. 

By accepting this offer, we secure a substantial profit and avoid the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
