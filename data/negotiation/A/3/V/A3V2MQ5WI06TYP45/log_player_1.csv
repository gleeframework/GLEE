This offer gives you a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum price, making it appealing to Bob. However, it still leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn closer to your desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with him, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not willing to sell below my minimum yet."
