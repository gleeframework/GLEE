"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's currently valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This represents a significant discount and allows you to acquire a valuable product at a price that's advantageous for you. Consider this a unique opportunity to make a substantial investment in your company's future.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
