Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $2,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000, which is still a fair price for the benefits it provides. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective on the price.  To be candid, $2,000,000 is my ideal target, but I'm willing to negotiate to make this work. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've described and my budget constraints. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $1,400,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to John's standing offer.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
