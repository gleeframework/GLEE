Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** By framing the price as a ""fair reflection of its worth,"" you subtly anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, which could still land you a better deal than John's offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's position as a valued potential buyer."
