"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
