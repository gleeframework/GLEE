"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $980,000 is still unfortunately below my desired price. I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.
