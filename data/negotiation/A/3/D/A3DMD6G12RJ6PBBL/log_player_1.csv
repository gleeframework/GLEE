Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $1,100,000, I can potentially get closer to my desired $1,200,000 if Bob counters.
* **Addressing John:** I'm keeping John in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This signals my willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a High Value:** $1,050,000 is still above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving me a better outcome than accepting his initial offer.
* **Setting a Firm Stance:**  I'm indicating that I'm not willing to go much lower than $1,050,000, but I'm open to further discussion.

This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to raise his offer while simultaneously demonstrating my flexibility in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. There's still a chance we can reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still holding John's offer as a safety net, giving me leverage to push for a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to my target while ensuring I have a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $980,000 is still unfortunately below my desired price. I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm setting a firm stance by declaring this my final offer. This creates urgency for Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,020,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Alternative Option:**  The mention of ""exploring other options"" subtly reminds Bob of John and the $1,200,000 offer. 

This counteroffer is a final attempt to secure a price closer to my target while leaving room for Bob to consider the consequences of rejecting the offer."
