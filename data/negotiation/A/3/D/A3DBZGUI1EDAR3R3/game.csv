"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. How about we meet at $85? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $88, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $88. I'm willing to go up to $84, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",84.0,Bob,6,
