Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its actual worth. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $12,500?  I'm hoping we can find an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his increases are getting smaller. At this point, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $12,500.  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of Bob not meeting a price point that works for me."
