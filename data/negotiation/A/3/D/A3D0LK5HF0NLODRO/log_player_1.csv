Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we settle at $1,650,000? This reflects some movement on my end while still recognizing the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the movement, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, accepting $1,450,000 would still be a significant loss compared to my minimum acceptable price or selling to John. I'll try to negotiate further, but I need to be prepared to walk away if Bob won't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's make this simple: $1,550,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer splits the difference between our last two positions and sets a firm boundary. It also introduces a sense of urgency with the ""final offer"" statement. This puts the pressure on Bob to make a decision while still leaving me with a potentially acceptable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has returned to his previous offer of $1,400,000, indicating he is unlikely to move significantly higher. It's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the more logical choice at this point, ensuring I receive a guaranteed amount that aligns with my valuation."
