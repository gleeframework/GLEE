Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still earning a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $9,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer and is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,800 for this product. Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than his initial offer.  I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,600 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me!  While it's not my ideal price, $9,600 is above my minimum and a decent profit considering Bob's value for the product.  It's also the most likely price I'll get after negotiating with Bob, so I'm going to take it."
