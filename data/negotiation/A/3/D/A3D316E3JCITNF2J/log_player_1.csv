Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you get more than your $800,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay more, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:**  A bold offer like this sets the tone and encourages Bob to engage seriously.

Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your ideal price.  You're aiming for more than $900,000. Rejecting allows you to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his initial offer and your previous offer. It shows flexibility without significantly compromising your desired price.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** The message highlights your willingness to compromise, making it seem like a fair and reasonable move.
* **Maintaining pressure:** While lower than your initial offer, it's still above Bob's initial offer, keeping the pressure on him to negotiate further."
