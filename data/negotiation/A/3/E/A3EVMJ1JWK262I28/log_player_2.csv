"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $140 for it. This price reflects the quality and the worth it holds for you based on my understanding of your needs. I'm confident it's a fair deal that will meet both our expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to get her to lower the price further.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $150 if needed."
