Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $120 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($80), but significantly below your minimum ($150) and John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest without revealing your bottom line. If he's completely turned off by the price, you'll know to potentially adjust downwards in a subsequent offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150.  This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
