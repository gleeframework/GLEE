Given its value to you, I propose a price of $14,000. This offers a reasonable profit for me while still providing you with significant savings compared to its full worth of $12,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in your product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which would still allow you a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
