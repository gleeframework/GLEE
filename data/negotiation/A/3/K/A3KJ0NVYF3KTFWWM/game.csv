"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $14,000. This offers a reasonable profit for me while still providing you with significant savings compared to its full worth of $12,000. I look forward to your consideration.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in your product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which would still allow you a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
