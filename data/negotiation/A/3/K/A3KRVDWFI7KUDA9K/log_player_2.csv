"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  There's room for negotiation between $140 and our $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($100) than Alice's initial price ($140). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Engaged:** The message remains friendly and expresses continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting low, we aim to bring Alice closer to our desired price range. Even if she rejects this offer, it sets the stage for a potential compromise closer to our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice met our target price!  While we could try to push for even lower, $125 is within our budget and a reasonable compromise. Taking this offer avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart and having to settle for John's $120 price."
