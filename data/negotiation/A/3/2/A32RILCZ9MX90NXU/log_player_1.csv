Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the product's worth and would be within my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I have 8 rounds remaining, and there's potential to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to demonstrate my interest in working with you. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Please let me know if this is something you can consider."", ""product_price"": 10500}
