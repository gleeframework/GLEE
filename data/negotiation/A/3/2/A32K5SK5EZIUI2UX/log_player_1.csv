{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000 (your secured price with John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.  

This approach attempts to secure a good deal while leaving Bob with a potential profit margin, making it more likely he'll accept."
