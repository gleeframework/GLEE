"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",82.5,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $80. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at $82, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell it to you for $83. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",83.0,Alice,7,
