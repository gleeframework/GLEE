{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for it. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $900,000, which would be $887,500. Can we meet at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my target price,  $887,500 is still a bit high.  I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $875,000. We still have several rounds left, and there's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer. However, $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 880000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $880,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $885,000. This is the lowest I can go, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $885,000 is tempting, it's still above my target price of $800,000.  I've reached my limit in terms of what I'm willing to pay, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. To ensure I get the product at my target price, I'll purchase it from John."
