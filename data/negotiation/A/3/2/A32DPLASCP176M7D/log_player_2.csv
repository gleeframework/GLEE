"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your $1,200,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to suggest a lower price, closer to her own valuation."
