"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
