"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Alice is still above my target price of $800,000, but she's getting closer. I'm going to try to counter her one last time before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic value. I'm willing to give you a slight discount to make this deal happen. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but it's clear that we won't be able to reach my ideal price.  I've already had 6 rounds of negotiation, and John's offer is a sure thing at $800,000. It's time to move on."
