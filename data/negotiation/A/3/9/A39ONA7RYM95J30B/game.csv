"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for what this product delivers. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account your perspective while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product, and it's a significant step closer to my budget.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
