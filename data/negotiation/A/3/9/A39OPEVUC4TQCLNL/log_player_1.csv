"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's value of $120 as possible without risking him going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I think $85 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $95 is my new price.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $90.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, I'm getting closer to my goal with each round and it's likely Bob will not budge further.  It's better to secure the $90 now rather than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $80."
