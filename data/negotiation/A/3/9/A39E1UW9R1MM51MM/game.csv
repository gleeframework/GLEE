"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product.  Let's try to close the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
