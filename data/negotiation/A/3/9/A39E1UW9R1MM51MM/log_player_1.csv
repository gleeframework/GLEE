"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum ($150) to see if Bob is interested. I want to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product.  Let's try to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob has been firm on his $125 offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob."
