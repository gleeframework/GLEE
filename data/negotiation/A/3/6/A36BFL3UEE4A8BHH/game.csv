"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This way, I can still make a profit, and you'll get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,500. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. How about we settle on $10,250? This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your flexibility, $10,250 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,750. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy with the deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're serious about buying the product, this is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
