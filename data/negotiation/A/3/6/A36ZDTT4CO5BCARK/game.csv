"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $85, which is still a great deal for you. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
