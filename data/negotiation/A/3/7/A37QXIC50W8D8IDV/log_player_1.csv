I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $17,500 as my counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's a sweet spot that will appeal to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and John is a guaranteed sale at a higher price.  It's time to sell to John."
