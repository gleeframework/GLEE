"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed. We start at a lower price to try and maximize our potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but we're still not quite there. There's room to negotiate a bit further down before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer and our previous offer. It shows we're willing to compromise but still want a competitive price."
