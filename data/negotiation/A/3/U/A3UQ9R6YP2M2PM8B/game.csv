"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done. Let's see if we can agree.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just doesn't cut it.  This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $950,000?  It's a significant reduction from my original offer, and it shows my willingness to be flexible. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering I'm already paying more than what I could get it for elsewhere. Let's find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you - $900,000 is a good step in the right direction. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and get you on your way to success.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still looking to pay closer to $900,000.  If you can meet me there, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options. ",900000.0,Bob,6,
