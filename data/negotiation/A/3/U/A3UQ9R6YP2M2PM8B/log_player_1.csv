"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High starting price:**  I'm starting high ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing message:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Boldness:**  I'm confident in my product's worth and hoping to secure a good deal right away.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** I'm aware of John's $1,000,000 offer, but I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob.
* **Risk:**  Starting high could scare Bob off, but it also sets a high benchmark for future negotiations.
* **10 rounds:** This is a limited time frame, so I need to be assertive but also willing to compromise as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a good sign that Bob is willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob at a loss.
* **Room for counter-offers:** I still have 8 rounds left, which allows me to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, leaving room for potential compromise.  I'll also try to emphasize the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Staying focused:**  I'll remain aware of John's offer as a fallback option while striving for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just doesn't cut it.  This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $950,000?  It's a significant reduction from my original offer, and it shows my willingness to be flexible. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price ($950,000) than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, encouraging him to see the value in investing a bit more.
* **Urgency:** I'm pushing for a quick agreement, emphasizing the importance of moving the negotiation forward.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm optimistic about reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **Balancing act:**  I need to find the right balance between being too aggressive and losing Bob, and being too accommodating and leaving money on the table. 
* **Future rounds:** I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'm hoping this counter-offer will move the deal closer to a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering I'm already paying more than what I could get it for elsewhere. Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough to cover my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is a safe option:** I can still secure a better price by selling to John, so there's no urgent need to accept Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation room:** I have 6 rounds remaining, so I have time to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'll make a counter-offer that's closer to $950,000, but with a lower price than my previous offer. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of reaching a deal.
* **Stay focused on John's offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, but I'm determined to get a better price from Bob.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I'm trying to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and potentially losing Bob's interest. 
* **Time management:**  With limited rounds remaining, I need to make each counter-offer strategic and move the negotiation toward a favorable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you - $900,000 is a good step in the right direction. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and get you on your way to success."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm reducing my offer by a smaller amount ($25,000) to show flexibility while remaining close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain from owning it.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is still a safe option, I'm optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob at a slightly higher price.
* **Remaining rounds:** With 5 rounds left, I'm aiming for a quick resolution.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still looking to pay closer to $900,000.  If you can meet me there, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's stance:** Bob is firm on his $900,000 price, and I've already made significant concessions.  
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, the odds of Bob increasing his offer are slim.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, which is significantly higher than Bob's best offer.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing with Bob could lead to further negotiation rounds, potentially ending with a lower price or no deal at all.
* **Time is money:**  With limited time, I need to make the most profitable decision.
* **Certainty:** John's offer provides certainty and a higher profit margin. 

**Conclusion:**  I've exhausted the negotiation options with Bob, and John's offer is the best available option to maximize my profits."
