"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my final price, and I'm confident it's a fair offer considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Alice. I'm offering $1000000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a reasonable price, but I still need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm only going up to $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm going to try to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $1150000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $1050000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'm making one final offer of $1050000. Please let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
