"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price point.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. This is my final offer, and it would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable price.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to make a deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
