Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as that's the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate, but I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still below what I need. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to him, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept it. While I would prefer $950,000, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or Bob walking away is too high. $920,000 is a good deal considering my minimum is $1,000,000."
