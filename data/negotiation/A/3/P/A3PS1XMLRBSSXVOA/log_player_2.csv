"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $120. It's worth seeing if Alice might lower her price."
