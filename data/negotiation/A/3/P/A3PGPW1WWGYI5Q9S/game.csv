"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $130?  This still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $125, but I'm still a bit too far from where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get what we want.  Let's close this deal!",135.0,Alice,5,
