"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is less than the $1,200,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Bob can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a bold move, but it's within his budget and a good starting point for negotiation. Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer is still profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  There's still room for negotiation to try and reach a price closer to his target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise.  $975,000 is still within his budget and a reasonable price for Alice to consider, especially with the time pressure of the limited negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to Bob's target. While it's still above his ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John at a higher price is significant.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price."
