**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* While Alice's offer is a discount from the initial $1,000,000, Bob can still get the product from John for $1,000,000. 
* Since Bob is looking for the best price, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is a better strategy."
