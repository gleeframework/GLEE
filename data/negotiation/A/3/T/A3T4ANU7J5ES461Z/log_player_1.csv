Round 6

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, but it's still substantially below my minimum.  While there's risk, I'll try one more time to hold firm and see if he'll budge. It's worth risking one more round to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I've tried to be flexible.  However,  $925,000 is simply too far below its value.  I'm willing to hold at my previous offer of $950,000.  I believe this is more than fair, and I'm hopeful you'll reconsider."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm holding firm at my previous offer to signal that I'm not going to be pushed much lower. By repeating the offer, I'm emphasizing that it's a fair deal. This puts the ball back in Bob's court to see if he's willing to move closer to my position."
