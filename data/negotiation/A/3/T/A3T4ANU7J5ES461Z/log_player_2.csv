```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a very competitive offer, considering the potential returns you'll gain from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I understand you value the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for the value this product offers.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I've tried to be flexible.  However,  $925,000 is simply too far below its value.  I'm willing to hold at my previous offer of $950,000.  I believe this is more than fair, and I'm hopeful you'll reconsider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $950,000, which is still outside Bob's budget.  Since Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, it's more financially beneficial to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
