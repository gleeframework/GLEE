"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for your product. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product to Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,375,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with selling the product for that price. I believe I can secure a better deal if we keep negotiating."
