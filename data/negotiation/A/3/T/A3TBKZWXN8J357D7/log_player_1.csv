This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum but still leaves room for bargaining. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This price still leaves you room to profit from the product, and it's a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
