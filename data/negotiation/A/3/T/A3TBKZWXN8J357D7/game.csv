"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This price still leaves you room to profit from the product, and it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
