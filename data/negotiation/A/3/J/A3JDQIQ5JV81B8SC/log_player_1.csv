"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is no more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand his budget constraints, $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I still have 8 rounds to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value it brings to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I still want to try to get closer to my $1,000,000 target. There are still several rounds left, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $975,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $962,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value it brings to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $962,500 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000.  There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  I'll accept $968,750.

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've reached a point where it's unlikely I'll get closer to my desired price with Bob, and I'm running out of rounds.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than what I'm likely to get from Bob, so it's the better choice for me financially."
