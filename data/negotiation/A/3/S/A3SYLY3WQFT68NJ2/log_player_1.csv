Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset that I'm sure will be of great benefit to your business. Let's start the negotiation with a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000. This still leaves room for you to make a substantial profit, and it's closer to the value we both recognize this product holds."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price and a good deal considering the limited rounds.  It's better than selling to John at $1,200,000, and leaves me room to negotiate further if Bob is open to it."
