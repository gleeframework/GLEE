"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. My asking price is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, creating a positive impression.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to secure a favorable price while keeping the negotiation open for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **More negotiation needed:**  I need to explore further if there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.  There are still 9 rounds left, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safety net:** Even if I don't close a deal with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to see if we can reach a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a slightly lower price:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still staying above Bob's initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my profit margin.
* **Reiterate interest:**  I'm reaffirming my interest in selling to Bob, suggesting a mutual desire to reach a deal.
* **Open for discussion:**  I'm asking Bob for his feedback, keeping the communication open and inviting him to continue negotiating.

This strategy aims to  find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Would you consider $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise,  $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Opportunity to increase offer:**  I've already moved down from my initial asking price. There's a possibility Bob might increase his offer if I continue to reject.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can continue negotiating without immediate pressure. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is unfortunately still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and try $10,125? I'm hoping we can reach a deal soon."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a commitment to compromise and helps maintain momentum.
* **Emphasizing time:**  I'm subtly suggesting that we should aim to reach an agreement soon, putting a little pressure on Bob.
* **Open for discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but I'm confident that my counteroffer is a fair and reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Would you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Although Bob has increased his offer, $9,900 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  The gap is closing, and Bob is showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time to increase pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's time to try to push Bob a little further.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. However, $9,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering your previous offer and my own need to get a fair price, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show appreciation, but stay firm:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts, but I reiterate that his offer is still too low.
* **Compromise, but not too much:** I lower my price slightly to $10,000, which is a small concession but still above Bob's last offer.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** I mention the need to finalize the deal in the next few rounds, putting a bit of pressure on Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while staying true to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Limited time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation with only 2 rounds remaining. 
* **Minimal progress:** Despite multiple rounds of negotiation, Bob's offer remains significantly below my desired price. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I meet my minimum price and secure a significant profit.

It's not guaranteed that I can push Bob to a higher price in the remaining rounds.  It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed sale to John and minimize the risk of losing out on a better deal."
