Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially allowing you to still sell above your minimum price of $80.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we could start higher, it might make Bob less likely to engage in negotiation.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale to Bob."
