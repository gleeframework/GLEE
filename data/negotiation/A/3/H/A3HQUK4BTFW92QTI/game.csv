"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $13,000 on it. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $11,500 is a bit steep. I'd like to stick to my original offer of $10,000. If you could meet me halfway, that would be great. Otherwise, I'll consider buying it from John.",10000.0,Bob,4,
