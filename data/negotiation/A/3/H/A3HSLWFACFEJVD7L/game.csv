"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.
