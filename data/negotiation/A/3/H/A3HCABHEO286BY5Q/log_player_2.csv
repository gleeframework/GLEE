Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to offer you $10,600 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,600 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,700. This is as low as I can go, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and while $10,700 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend, it's only $700 over my maximum budget.  It's likely that further negotiation will lead to more concessions on my side, and I want to avoid losing this opportunity.  I'll accept the offer."
