{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer.  It also demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, which can be beneficial in building a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand $90 is a fair price for you. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to consider $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I've already made a significant concession by dropping to $95 and it seems unlikely he'll go any higher.  To ensure I get my desired profit, I'll sell to John for $120."
