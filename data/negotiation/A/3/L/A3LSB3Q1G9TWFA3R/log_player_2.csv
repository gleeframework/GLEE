"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000, which I believe reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's best to counter offer and negotiate a better deal.  Buying from John right away would mean missing an opportunity to get a potentially lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my actual maximum ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Leaving Room:**  By starting low, I signal that I'm looking for a good deal. It also gives Alice an opportunity to counter with a more reasonable price. 
* **Polite and Direct:** My message is polite but clear about my budget limitations. I express continued interest in the product to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $11,000.  This is my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are still seven rounds left, and Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to meet closer to your target.
* **Strategic Counter:** Rejecting this offer allows you to propose a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand the product's value, but $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to my maximum limit with this counter-offer. A $1,000 increase from the previous offer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a fair deal.
* **Expressing Eagerness:** Mentioning that I'm ""eager to make this work"" shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and encourages her to find a price point we can both agree on.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is strategically placed between Alice's current price and my target price, leaving space for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to make this work, and I appreciate that.  Let's meet in the middle - $9,500.  This is a very fair price considering the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** While Alice is moving closer to your range, $9,500 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer.
* **Time Advantage:**  With 5 rounds remaining, you still have time to negotiate and there's no need to settle for a price above your limit.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** Alice knows you have an alternative option.  By rejecting this offer, you signal you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I had in mind.  Could we settle at $7,500?  That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** While Alice made a significant jump in her last counteroffer, it's essential to stand your ground and not get pulled above your budget. 
* **Reasonable Increase:** A $500 increase from your previous offer shows a willingness to move towards a deal but emphasizes your price limit.
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, you want to guide Alice toward your range while still leaving room for minor adjustments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $9,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  It's a fantastic deal for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Even with her ""final offer,"" Alice remains $1,000 above your maximum budget and what John is offering.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting this offer, you call Alice's bluff on it being her ""absolute bottom line."" It shows you're willing to walk away, which might make her reconsider.
* **Limited Risk:** You still have three rounds left to negotiate a better price or buy from John. You've successfully brought Alice down $4,000 already, so there's a chance for further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stick to my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $7,750, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but unwilling to budge on your budget. It emphasizes your commitment while establishing a firm price ceiling.
* **Slight Increase:**  Offering a small increase of $250 from your previous offer signals a willingness to compromise slightly for a deal.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only two rounds remaining, this offer adds a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to make a decision."
