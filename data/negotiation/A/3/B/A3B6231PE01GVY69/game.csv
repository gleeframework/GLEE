,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still giving you a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a significant concession on my end. This price is fair for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. Let's close this deal now.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of its value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your commitment, and I appreciate your effort. However, $975,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. This allows for both of us to have a good deal and avoids any further negotiation. Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $975,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. I'd like to finalize the deal at $975,000.",975000.0,Bob,8,
