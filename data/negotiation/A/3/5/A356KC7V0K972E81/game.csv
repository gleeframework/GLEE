"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'd need $1,125,000 to make this work. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident it will be worth it.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I think that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to finalize this deal. It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
