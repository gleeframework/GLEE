{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This offer signals that you understand the product's worth but aren't being overly aggressive, which could scare Bob away.

**Important:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product. If you had more information, you might adjust your approach."
