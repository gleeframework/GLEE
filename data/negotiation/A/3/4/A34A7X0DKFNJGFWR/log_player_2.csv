Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me to consider.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  To make this work, we need to get closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's try to bridge this gap.
