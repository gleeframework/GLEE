"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm starting with an initial price of $1,200,000, reflecting the product's high quality and potential value. Let's discuss further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is significantly over my budget. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me to consider. Given the product's true worth and potential, I believe a price of $1,050,000 would be fair for both of us. This price allows for a profitable deal while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $975,000. This price is closer to my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  To make this work, we need to get closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's try to bridge this gap.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $995,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still ensuring a profitable deal for you.",995000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your financial constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000.  This price is just slightly above your last offer, and it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
