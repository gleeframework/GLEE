"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more to make this work. How about $12,000? That's closer to your price and still gives me some wiggle room.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be very happy with the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",10750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's meet halfway again, how about $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,7,
