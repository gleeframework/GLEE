"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, so you're getting a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested!  If not, I'll be selling it to John for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than you value it.  You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. While Alice mentions selling it to John, there's no guarantee she's being truthful. By rejecting her offer, you can proceed with your backup plan and buy from John at your desired price."
