"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to create a sense of urgency and high value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $925,000 is less than your maximum but still a significant amount over John's price. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down further or proceed with your guaranteed option of buying from John."
