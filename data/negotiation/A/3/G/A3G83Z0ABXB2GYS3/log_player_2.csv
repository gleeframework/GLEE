"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least that much to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up for the same price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  While Alice is trying to pressure Bob, Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
