You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

$20,000 is way over my budget. I'll try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $10,000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and it's likely to be rejected. But it sets the stage for negotiation and gives me a starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$18,000 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $15,000. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about buying, but it's still below what I'm willing to pay from John. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a fair price."
