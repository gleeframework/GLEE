"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product, but I have to be fair to myself and my business. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $8,000."
