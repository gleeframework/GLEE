Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but still significantly above my minimum. This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still above my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll try to squeeze out a bit more by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit that's closer to what the product is worth to me while also making it more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
