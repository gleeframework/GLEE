"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $14,000.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible while still staying within his $15,000 limit.  Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's halfway between Alice's offer of $14,000 and his own limit of $15,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. It's also close to Bob's previous offer of $13,000, so further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result."
