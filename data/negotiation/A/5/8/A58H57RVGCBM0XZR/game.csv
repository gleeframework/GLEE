"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit your business greatly. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm currently able to invest. To make this work, I'd need to come in at a price closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with your perspective. I understand your position, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential impact.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. While I'm still interested, $1,900,000 remains outside of my comfort zone. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This would allow both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's continue working towards that goal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's aim for a win-win.  Could you consider a price of $1,600,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to move from your initial offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're making progress, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
