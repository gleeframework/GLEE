""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit your business greatly. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm currently able to invest. To make this work, I'd need to come in at a price closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with your perspective. I understand your position, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential impact.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. While I'm still interested, $1,900,000 remains outside of my comfort zone. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This would allow both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's continue working towards that goal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now showing a willingness to move significantly from his initial offer. This suggests there is room for negotiation. However, $1,200,000 is still substantially less than John's offer.  We will continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's aim for a win-win.  Could you consider a price of $1,600,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to move from your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're making progress, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is now very close to your backup offer from John. While you could push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting $1,400,000 secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
