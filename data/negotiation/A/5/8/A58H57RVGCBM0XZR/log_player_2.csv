"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit your business greatly. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,200,000 is far beyond Bob's budget of $800,000.  It's crucial to start negotiating and get the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm currently able to invest. To make this work, I'd need to come in at a price closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with your perspective. I understand your position, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential impact.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. He's already shown a willingness to walk away, which gives him leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. While I'm still interested, $1,900,000 remains outside of my comfort zone. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This would allow both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's continue working towards that goal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's aim for a win-win.  Could you consider a price of $1,600,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to move from your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still too high for Bob.  While he's willing to negotiate, he's not going to significantly overpay for the product.  Bob needs to continue negotiating to get the price down closer to his target of $800,000. It's a good sign that Alice is making concessions, which suggests she's open to finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're making progress, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
