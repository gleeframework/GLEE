Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling willingness to negotiate, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to create a good rapport with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. I'll keep John's offer of $80 in mind as a baseline."
