"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and we're confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing, but $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm glad to present you with an alternative offer. How about $90 for the product? This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is closer to Bob's desired price point. It's still a bit higher than what Bob ideally wants, but it's a better deal than buying from John for $100. Accepting the offer means Bob can get the product for a price he can reasonably afford."
