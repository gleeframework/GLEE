"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,100,000. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better deal than John's price,  there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,000,000? This would allow you to make a good profit while still providing me with a significant saving."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. This is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000. While there's always the chance of getting a lower price, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal, and it's likely Alice won't budge further.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation delays or the chance of Alice backing out completely."
