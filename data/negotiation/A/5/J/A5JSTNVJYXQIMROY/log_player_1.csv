"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. I'm hoping to capitalize on the fact that Bob is a potential buyer, but I don't know his value for the product.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low for me, especially considering I'm already at the second round.  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $10,000 by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $9,500.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to negotiate, Bob will be more likely to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $9,200, which is very close to my desired price point. Given that we're already at round 4, I'm confident that I won't be able to get much higher.  Accepting this offer secures a decent profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or even having to sell to John for less."
