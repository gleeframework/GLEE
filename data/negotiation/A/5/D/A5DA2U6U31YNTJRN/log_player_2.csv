Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget of $1,500,000 and represents a good compromise. It's also higher than the $1,200,000 Alice values the product at, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John."
