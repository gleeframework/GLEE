Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John guarantees me a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and far less than what I can get from John. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price slightly again, but still holding firm above Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining my desired profit margin. I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and although it's higher than his previous offers, the negotiations seem to be stalling. I'm confident in selling to John for a much higher price, so I'm choosing to end the negotiations with Bob and finalize the sale with John."
