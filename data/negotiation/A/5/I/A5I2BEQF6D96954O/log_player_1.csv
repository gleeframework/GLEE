"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,000 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach our $12,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
