Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,250,000? This would still give you a significant profit, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to suggest $1,225,000 for the product. I hope this offer is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price,  $1,225,000 is still below my desired outcome.  I'm only a few rounds away from selling to John for my target price of $1,500,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,225,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,237,500?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1237500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal careful consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. My final offer for the product is $1,230,000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,230,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is increasing. It's time to secure my desired price by selling to John."
