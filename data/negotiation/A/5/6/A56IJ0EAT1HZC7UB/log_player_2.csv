Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $8,300. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While still above our ideal price, Alice has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $8,300 secures a significant saving compared to John's $12,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice walking away, leaving us with the less favorable option."
