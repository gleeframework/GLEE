"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value it has to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its current market value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is below what I can accept. This product has significant intrinsic value that I believe justifies a higher price point.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $975,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  However, $900,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. ",950000.0,Alice,5,
