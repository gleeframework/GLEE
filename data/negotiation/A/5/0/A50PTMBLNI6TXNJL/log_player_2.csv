"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price from Alice first. $140 is still a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, which might make her more willing to negotiate. By starting lower, we leave room to potentially meet in the middle while still staying well below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125? This is a great deal for you and still allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, and $125 is close enough to our $120 limit. It's unlikely we'll get a better price from Alice, and it's better to secure the deal now than risk losing it."
