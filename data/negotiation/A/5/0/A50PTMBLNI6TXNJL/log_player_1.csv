{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation if he rejects. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125? This is a great deal for you and still allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
