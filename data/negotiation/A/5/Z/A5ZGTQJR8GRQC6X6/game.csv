"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $862,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I believe the product's value to me is higher than that, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $880,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
