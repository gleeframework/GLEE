{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum value, but still above Bob's perceived value. This will encourage Bob to negotiate, but still allows me to potentially secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  While $10,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $9,500? That would make it easier for me to say yes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a bit lower than I'd like. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a compromise, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $10,000? That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
