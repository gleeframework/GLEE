"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still fair considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
