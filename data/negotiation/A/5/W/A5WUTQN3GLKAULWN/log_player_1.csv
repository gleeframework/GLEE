"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm aiming for a profit. This initial offer is aggressive, but it allows room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than my minimum of $150, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll see if I can get a higher price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above my minimum of $150. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, while still aiming for a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is only $10 below my minimum price, and I've already rejected two offers. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum price."
