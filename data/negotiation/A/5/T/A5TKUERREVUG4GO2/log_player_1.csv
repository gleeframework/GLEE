Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,200,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This still allows me to stay within my financial limits while securing the product I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 threshold I need. It's in my best interest to take John's guaranteed offer and avoid the risk of Bob not meeting my minimum price."
