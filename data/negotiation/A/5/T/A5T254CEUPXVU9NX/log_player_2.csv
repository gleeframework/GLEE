"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  Based on its potential, I'm asking for $1200000. I'm confident it's a fair price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm very interested in the product, however. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll come down further, and you could risk losing the deal entirely.  Buying from Alice at $1,000,000 is the most financially sensible choice at this point."
