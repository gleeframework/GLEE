Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to the product's value to Bob.
* **Not too high:** I'm not starting at the full $15,000 value to Bob, as this could make him immediately reject the offer.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer gives Bob room to counteroffer and potentially reach a price we both find agreeable. 

By offering $12,000, I am setting the stage for a negotiation that could benefit both of us."
