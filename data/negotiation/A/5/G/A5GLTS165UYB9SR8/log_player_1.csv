Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but lower than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob and staying positive to encourage a deal. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation.  I'm also keeping John in the back of my mind as a backup buyer if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to do $10500? That's my maximum budget, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  While it's closer than his initial value, it's not yet a good deal for me. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can close the gap and get closer to $12,000. However, I'll keep John in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price slightly to $11,000.  This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his budget, but also emphasizing the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to move a bit closer to my price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
