"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to do $10500? That's my maximum budget, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
