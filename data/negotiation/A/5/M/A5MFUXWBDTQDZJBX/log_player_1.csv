Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation. This also leaves a buffer between my minimum acceptable price and the offer, giving me room to make concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me and is closer to Bob's perceived value, potentially making it more appealing to him.  It also leaves some room for negotiation in the next round if necessary."
