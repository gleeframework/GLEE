"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! It's a good starting point. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential savings for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1050000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while allowing us both to come to a fair agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
