Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the sale to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, so I don't need to go below that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below my minimum ($150) at $145 makes it seem like a deal to Bob while still netting me a significant profit."
