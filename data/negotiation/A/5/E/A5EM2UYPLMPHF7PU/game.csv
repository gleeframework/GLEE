I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in purchasing it?,12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for at $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,500, which is $12,250. That's the lowest I can go.",12250.0,Alice,5,
