I'm rejecting Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is better than her original offer, I'm still hoping to get it for closer to my target price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for at $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,500, which is $12,250. That's the lowest I can go.

Alice's offer of $12,250 is a good compromise. It's still within my budget and a better price than what John is offering.  I'm going to accept it."
