Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $100, you are aiming for a price that is significantly higher than your minimum but still attractive to Bob (since it's $20 less than his valuation).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept the offer."
