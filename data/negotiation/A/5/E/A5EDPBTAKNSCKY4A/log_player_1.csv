Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a substantial profit while I get a good price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using positive language emphasizes mutual benefit. 
* **Opportunity for Profit:** Highlighting Bob's potential profit encourages him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:** 

This initial offer is a strategic move. It allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** Bob's response will reveal his willingness to negotiate.
* **Set a High Baseline:** This makes it easier for me to accept a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** I can always counter his offer, or accept John's offer if Bob is too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and willing to negotiate further.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting, I keep the option to accept John's offer open if necessary.
* **Counter Offer:**  My counteroffer will be closer to my desired price, hopefully persuading Bob to come closer to my terms."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to be closer to my asking price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still gives you a substantial profit margin, and it's the most I can offer at this time. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price but only slightly, showing flexibility while still staying within my desired range.
* **Emphasis on Profit:**  Reiterating Bob's potential profit encourages him to consider my offer.
* **Finality:**  Using ""the most I can offer"" creates a sense of urgency and discourages further haggling.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to compromise further.
* **Shift the Balance:**  It pushes the negotiation closer to my desired outcome.
* **Prepare for Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will have to decide whether to accept his next offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Furthermore, Bob's message suggests he is unwilling to budge further. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially dropping out of the negotiation completely.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, eliminating the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation. 
* **Time is Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation with Bob could potentially cost me time and opportunities.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed high profit and move on to potentially more profitable opportunities."
