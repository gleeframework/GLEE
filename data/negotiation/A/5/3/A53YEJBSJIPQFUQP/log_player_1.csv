"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity for you to significantly increase your profits. I'm starting at $1,000,000, recognizing the value it holds for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for my business. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my target price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, as Bob clearly sees the value in the product and I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm open to negotiating, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your business.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This allows you to secure a significant advantage and still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for my business. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $950,000, Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum target of $800,000.  It's a fair price considering his budget constraints, and it's important to avoid pushing the negotiation too far and risking losing the deal entirely."
