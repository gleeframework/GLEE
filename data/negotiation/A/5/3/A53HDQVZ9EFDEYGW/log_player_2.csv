{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** Bob proposes a middle ground price between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,750. I'm willing to compromise at $9,250.

```

```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Bob again proposes a middle ground price, this time between his previous offer of $8,750 and Alice's latest offer of $9,250. This demonstrates a commitment to finding a mutually acceptable solution.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,875, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best we can do at this point.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has successfully lowered the price from $9,500 to $9,000. While this is a significant improvement, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Time and Risk:**  With 3 rounds remaining,  Bob has the time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. Buying from John at $10,000 would be a worse outcome.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,900, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is a very small step towards Alice's price, signaling that Bob is almost at his limit.
* **Urgency:**  Bob emphasizes the limited time remaining, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to accept.
* **Fairness:** Bob reiterates that the offer is a fair compromise, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason. 

**Strategy:**  At this point, Bob is taking a calculated risk by making a counteroffer close to Alice's price. He's aiming to close the deal while still saving a significant amount of money. If Alice rejects, he might have to consider buying from John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm considering other options. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $9,100. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Limited Time:** This is the penultimate round.  If Bob rejects this offer, he risks having to buy from John at $10,000.
* **Slight Compromise:** Alice's offer is only $100 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a small concession.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting this offer means Bob saves $900 compared to buying from John. While he could potentially get the price down even further, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John is too high."
