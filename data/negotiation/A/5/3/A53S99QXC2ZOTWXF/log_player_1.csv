Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $8,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. That's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This creates some room for negotiation if he's interested, but it's still significantly less than my minimum value, guaranteeing me a profit.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By offering a slightly lower price than John, I might be able to convince Bob to accept. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the need to minimize risk."
