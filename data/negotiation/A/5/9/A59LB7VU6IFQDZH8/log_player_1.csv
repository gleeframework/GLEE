"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $14,000, knowing that the product is worth more to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price range with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to secure a good price."
