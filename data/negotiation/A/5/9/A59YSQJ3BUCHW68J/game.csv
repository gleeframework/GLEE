"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $175? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $150, which is the price I can afford right now. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
