"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.,82.0,Bob,4,
