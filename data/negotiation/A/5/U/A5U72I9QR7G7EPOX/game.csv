"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in it, while staying within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budgetary constraints, however,  the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I believe it represents a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
