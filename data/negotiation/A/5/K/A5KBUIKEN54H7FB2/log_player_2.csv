Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $860000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $860000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $880000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.

Alice has come down to a price I'm willing to pay, and we're getting close to the end of negotiations. It's better to take the deal and save the remaining $120,000 than risk losing her offer and ending up paying more to John."
