"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $900,000. This gives you a significant savings and ensures I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While it might be worth $1,000,000 to you, your goal is to save money.
* You have a backup option with John at $1,000,000.  
* Rejecting Alice's offer might make her come down in price, getting you a better deal. 
* Even if she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything by rejecting and going with John."
