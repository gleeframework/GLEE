"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $900,000. This gives you a significant savings and ensures I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,
