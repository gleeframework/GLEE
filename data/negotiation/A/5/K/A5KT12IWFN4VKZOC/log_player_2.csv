"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in making an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $110! Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming for a price well below $110, so starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($85) gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message is framed positively, expressing interest while also making it clear we're looking for a more budget-friendly option. This keeps the negotiation friendly and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still aiming to get closer to $90.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $90. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:** We're stating our desired price range directly now ($90) to guide the negotiation.
* **Open to Compromise:** The language still implies we're willing to negotiate a bit on this price, but we're holding firm to the general range.
* **Positive Tone:** We continue to maintain a positive and appreciative tone to keep the negotiation collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice is now offering her product at her initial valuation, which is a fair price. 
* **Time:** We are now in round 5. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice won't budge, and we might end up with a worse deal or having to buy from John at $120. It's better to secure a good price now."
