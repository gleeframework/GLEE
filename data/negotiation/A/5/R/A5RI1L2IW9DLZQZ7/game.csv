"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8500. Could you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8875?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8875.0,Alice,5,
