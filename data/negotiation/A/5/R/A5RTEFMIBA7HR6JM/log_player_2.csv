"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate down, starting well below your $1,000,000 limit to allow room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down considerably, the price is still far above your maximum and John's offer. It's worth continuing to negotiate."

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my goal is to reach a fair agreement. $800,000 is a significant gap from where we started. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000, but that's my final offer. This offer takes into account the real value of the product. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has stated this is her final offer and it's still significantly above your $1,000,000 limit. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, so it's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
