I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more. If he rejects, I can then see if he's willing to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get $15,000 right now, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's still a good deal for me, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. It's a small risk since I can always sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still trying to get more than Bob's initial offer. I believe $16,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 less than what John is willing to pay. It's a small difference, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. It's better to take the deal and secure the sale."
