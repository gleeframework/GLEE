"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1,400,000. This gives you a significant savings and ensures I receive a fair price. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
