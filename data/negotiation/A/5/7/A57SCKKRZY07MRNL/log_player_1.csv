Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $22,000. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower than our minimum, there's always a chance he's willing to pay more than $8,000.  Starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By initially presenting a high price ($22,000), we ""anchor"" the negotiation in our favor. Even if we need to come down, Bob might be more amenable to a price closer to $15,000 than he would have been if we started lower. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have some time to negotiate with Bob. If there's a tight deadline, a more aggressive approach might be necessary."
