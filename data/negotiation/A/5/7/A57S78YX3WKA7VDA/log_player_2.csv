"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1000000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You have a lot of negotiating room since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm not quite there yet.  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant jump down from Alice's initial price.  It's important to show you're serious about buying but also to leave room for further negotiation.  $750,000 is a good starting point to see if Alice is flexible with her pricing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $900000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too high.  You have room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $800,000 for now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer continues to bridge the gap between Alice and Bob's desired prices. By offering $800,000, Bob demonstrates a willingness to negotiate further while maintaining his goal of saving as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a logical step that shows progress in the negotiation."
