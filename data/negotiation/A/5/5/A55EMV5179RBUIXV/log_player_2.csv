"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($120)** is better than John's offer ($150) for you. 
* Even though you can save more money by rejecting and buying from John, you'll still end up paying more than you want to.
* Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to save money while still securing the product."
