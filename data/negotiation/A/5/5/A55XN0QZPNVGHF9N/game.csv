"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $155.  That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $155, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $158. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",158.0,Alice,5,
