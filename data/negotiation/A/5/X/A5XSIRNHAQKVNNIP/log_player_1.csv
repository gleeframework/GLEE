Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **Being Friendly:** A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating I'm open to negotiation, I show flexibility and willingness to work with Bob. This could lead to a smoother and more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to go down to $120? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.** I won't get any more money from Bob, so it's better to accept his offer rather than risk him walking away completely or engaging in a long and potentially unproductive negotiation.
* **Time is valuable.**  By accepting his offer, I close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of losing the sale to another buyer or simply wasting time in negotiation."
