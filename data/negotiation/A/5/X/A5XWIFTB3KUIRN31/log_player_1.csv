"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn a significant profit while also giving Bob some room to counter-offer.  I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my ideal value ($15,000) through the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $10,000.  While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob and leaves me with less profit. I believe I can push for a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
