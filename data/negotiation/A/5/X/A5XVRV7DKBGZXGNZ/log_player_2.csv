Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $105, and that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105, and your goal is to spend no more than $100. It's time to take advantage of John's offer."
