(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180. It's too expensive, so you should reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $160 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $160 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still over your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm happy to pay $130. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $145 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're getting closer to your desired price, but $145 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to go up to $140. That's a fair price considering we're both getting what we want. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $140, Bob! However, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $148 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $148
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your budget. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower than $148. You have only a few rounds left, and you don't want to risk running out of time. It's time to move on and buy the product from John for $120."
