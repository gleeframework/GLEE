"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $1,000,000.  Would you consider a counteroffer of $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me and provides a significant savings for you compared to selling to John."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,150,000 is significantly less than the $1,500,000 John is asking.
* **Minimal room for further negotiation:**  Alice has already met Bob halfway, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.  

While Bob could try for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy in this situation."
