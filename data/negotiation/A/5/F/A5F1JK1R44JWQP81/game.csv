"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $1,000,000.  Would you consider a counteroffer of $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me and provides a significant savings for you compared to selling to John.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
