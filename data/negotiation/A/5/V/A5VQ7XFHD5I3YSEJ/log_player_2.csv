"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While buying from Alice is cheaper than John, it's still more expensive than the product's worth to you ($1,000,000). It's better to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John, even though it's more expensive. This ensures you still get the product while minimizing your overall cost."
