Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **For you:** You are earning significantly more than your minimum price of $800,000.
* **For Bob:** He is getting a good deal, paying $50,000 less than the product is worth to him. This makes it likely he'll accept. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the chance of him accepting while still securing a substantial profit."
