"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1000000 to $1200000. Would you be willing to adjust the price to meet this range?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1400000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that we might be able to find common ground. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1350000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still securing such a valuable item.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1380000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe we could find an even better balance. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1360000? This price is slightly lower than your last offer, yet it still allows us to reach a fair agreement.",1360000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1360000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1400000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.
