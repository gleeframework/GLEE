Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $11,000}

This is a relatively high offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product. Let's see how he responds!"
