"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $12,000. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is over his budget and he can get the same product from John for less.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you, I am willing to negotiate at $11,500. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
