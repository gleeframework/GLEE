{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe this price is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob considering his valuation and it's closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in this offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum, and I'm happy to accept. There's no guarantee I'll get a better price in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
