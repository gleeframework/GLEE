"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? That gives you a good price and still allows me to get a fair amount for the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I can't go lower than $120. It's a great product that you'll get a lot of value from.  Let's meet in the middle at $120.",120.0,Alice,5,
