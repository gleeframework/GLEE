Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I've chosen $150 as my initial price. This is a reasonable starting point that gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive framing:** I've used positive language to encourage Bob to buy. Highlighting the value of the product could help him see it as a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I've made it clear that I'm open to negotiation by asking Bob to let me know his thoughts. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes that Bob is likely to be interested in the product. If I have no information about Bob's potential interest, I may want to start with a lower price."
