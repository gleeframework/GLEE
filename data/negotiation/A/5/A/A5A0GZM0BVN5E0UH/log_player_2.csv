"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

**Explanation:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $150, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You're aiming to save money, and John offers the lowest price you're willing to pay."
