"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price point that works for both of us, $1,250,000 is a significant drop.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe $1,400,000 is a more reflective price considering its potential ROI for you. Let's find a way to make this work.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. Can we find a way to meet in the middle?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.
