Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to my maximum budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500?

While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal range."

Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal, but Bob's offer of $8,950 is still below my minimum of $10,000.  I've only got two rounds left and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
