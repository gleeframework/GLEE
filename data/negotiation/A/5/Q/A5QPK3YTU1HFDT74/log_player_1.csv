Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. This is a great opportunity to get it at a significant discount. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $130 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy it for $100 provides a safety net, but Alice aims higher with Bob.

By opening with a price closer to Bob's perceived value, Alice increases her chances of a sale at a higher profit margin than John's offer."
