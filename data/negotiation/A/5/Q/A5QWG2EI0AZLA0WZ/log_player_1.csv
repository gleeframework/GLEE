Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could tap into.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose him.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of the value surplus, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Confident and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain if he accepts, a strong incentive.  This price also nets you a $150,000 profit above your guaranteed sale. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might counter-offer, or you might need to adjust your strategy if you have more information about Bob's negotiating style."
