Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to propose a compromise.

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but there is still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price lower than $400,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely you'll get much lower than $375,000.  At this price, you're saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and it's time to close the deal."
