Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable value. I will counteroffer to try and reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
