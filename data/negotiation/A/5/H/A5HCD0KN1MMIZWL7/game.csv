"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's work together to make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the discount, but $900,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $820,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I believe this price is more reasonable for both of us.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I still think $875,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
