Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a higher price. I'll see if I can meet him somewhere in the middle with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $900,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $820,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I believe this price is more reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I still think $875,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Even though I'd prefer to get a higher price, I've reached my limit in negotiations with Bob. It's better to secure a sale with John than risk losing both buyers."
