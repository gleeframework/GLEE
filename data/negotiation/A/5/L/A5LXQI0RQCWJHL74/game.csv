"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value it holds.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $127.50? Can you consider that?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $127.50 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $129.  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $129. How about $126? I'm really close to walking away and buying from John, but I'd love to make a deal with you.",126.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to drop my price to $128. That's just a dollar more than your offer and a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can make this deal happen.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $128, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $127? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I really want to make a deal with you.",127.0,Bob,8,
