"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
