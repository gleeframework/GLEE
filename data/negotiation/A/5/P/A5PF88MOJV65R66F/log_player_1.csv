Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) than my minimum ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Open communication:** I'm starting with a friendly and open message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not offering the full $1,000,000 immediately, I'm creating a space for potential counteroffers from Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and allowing for a possible win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $850,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $950,000 or higher. 

I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob because I think I can push for a higher price.  I'll also keep in mind that selling to John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm proposing a price that's in the middle ground between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforce value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob why this price is still reasonable.
* **Focus on compromise:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to create a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I conclude with an invitation for further discussion, keeping the door open for a potential agreement.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground while staying within my desired range. It also keeps the negotiation process going, allowing for the possibility of a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I would like to offer $875,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is only $25,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $850,000.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob isn't worth it. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and guarantees a profit close to my minimum acceptable earnings."
