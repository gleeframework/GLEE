"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its worth while leaving some room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let's find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer represents a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the product's worth.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
