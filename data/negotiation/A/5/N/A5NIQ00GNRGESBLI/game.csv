"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a bit more value for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but I think that's the highest I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $95. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I need to get at least $105 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking to get a good price for the product, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $105, which would be $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,6,
