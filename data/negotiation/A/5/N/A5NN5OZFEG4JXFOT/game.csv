"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile for me. I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm sure we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm offering $1,125,000. This is my final offer before I explore other options. ",1125000.0,Alice,5,
