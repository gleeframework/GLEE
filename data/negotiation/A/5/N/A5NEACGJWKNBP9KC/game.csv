"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is still a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, but also shows my willingness to compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This reflects my strong desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,090,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value, but also shows my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1090000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  Let's be direct:  I need to see a price closer to $1.2 million for this to make sense for me.  I'm willing to accept $1,110,000, but that's my final offer.  I do have other interested parties, and while I value our discussions, I need to prioritize the best overall deal.",1110000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'm offering $1,080,000, which is as close as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
