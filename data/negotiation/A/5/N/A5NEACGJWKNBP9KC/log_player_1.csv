"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly above Bob's perceived value but below our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's worth.
* **Justification:**  Framing the price with the product's ""unique opportunity"" and ""true value"" aims to shift Bob's focus from purely numerical comparison to the potential benefits. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $1,150,000, we have space to come down in future rounds while still aiming for a price above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is still a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, but also shows my willingness to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum. We have ample room for negotiation and a guaranteed offer from John.  Rejecting encourages Bob to move closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This reflects my strong desire to find a deal that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and make a significant concession to show flexibility and encourage a counter.
* **Holding Firm:**  While moving down, we stay above the halfway point between our initial offer and Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Positive Framing:**  We emphasize a ""win-win"" solution and reiterate the product's benefits, guiding the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,090,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value, but also shows my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's concessions are becoming smaller, and we're still significantly below our $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss.
* **John as Leverage:**  The guaranteed offer from John gives us a strong position. We don't need to rush into a deal with Bob, especially one below our valuation.
* **Maintaining Value:**  Continuing to negotiate, even if it means walking away, reinforces the product's worth in Bob's eyes, potentially leading to a better offer in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  Let's be direct:  I need to see a price closer to $1.2 million for this to make sense for me.  I'm willing to accept $1,110,000, but that's my final offer.  I do have other interested parties, and while I value our discussions, I need to prioritize the best overall deal."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  Five rounds in, we need to accelerate the negotiation.  We're being transparent about our minimum acceptable price while still leaving some room for Bob to counter.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Introducing a sense of urgency often encourages a counterparty to make their best move. 
* **Alternative Buyers:** Reminding Bob of our other options subtly increases the pressure to reach a deal now.
* **Slight Concession:** The small drop to $1,110,000 shows some flexibility while reinforcing the seriousness of our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'm offering $1,080,000, which is as close as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob's offer barely budged.  His ultimatum suggests he's unlikely to move significantly closer to our $1.2 million target.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation risks losing time and potentially a better deal with other interested parties. 
* **Guaranteed Value:** John's standing offer guarantees our minimum acceptable price and allows us to move on with no further risk or effort. 

While we could counter again, Bob's stance and the diminishing returns of continued negotiation make selling to John the most rational and profitable choice."
