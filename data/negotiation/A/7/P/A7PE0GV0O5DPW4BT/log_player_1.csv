{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $16,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also frames the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can't exceed $14,000 for it. Could we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great value for you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
