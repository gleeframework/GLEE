"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This is a good starting point because it gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  I also want to see if he's truly interested in the product and if he's willing to put in some effort to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum acceptable price.  However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $125 is a more reasonable price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise. I have 6 rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. It's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $122.50 is a fair price considering the original price you mentioned was $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're now in round 6, and Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $135. I have only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing more time trying to negotiate with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
