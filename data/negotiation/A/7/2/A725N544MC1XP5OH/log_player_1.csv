Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm asking for $950,000, reflecting its true worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Confident Language:** The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **John as Leverage (Implicit):** I don't mention John directly, but knowing I have another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity."
