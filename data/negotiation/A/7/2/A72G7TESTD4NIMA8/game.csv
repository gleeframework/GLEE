"Hey Alice, $90 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $75.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit too high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute max.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,
