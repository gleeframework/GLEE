"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? It's a fair price that leaves us both with some room to be happy. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000.  Let's try $9,100.  It's a small compromise on both our sides, and it'll allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900?  It's a fair price that's close to both of our desired numbers. What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,900 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $9,000. It's only a hundred dollars more than your last offer, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,7,
