"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, you can do better than $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? It's a fair price that leaves us both with some room to be happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,250 is closer to your target, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000.  Let's try $9,100.  It's a small compromise on both our sides, and it'll allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,100 is tempting, you're still only five rounds away from buying from John for $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900?  It's a fair price that's close to both of our desired numbers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,900 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $9,000. It's only a hundred dollars more than your last offer, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've only got three rounds left, and you're at a point where you're risking getting no deal at all if you keep rejecting Alice's offers.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, which is your target price, it's the safer option. You can secure the product and save the potential hassle of further negotiation with Alice."
