This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your portfolio. I know you're familiar with the product's worth, so I'm confident this is a fair offer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at that price. While it's a ""fair"" offer in terms of your maximum, you have a guaranteed alternative with John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer, as you can get the same product from John for the same price."
