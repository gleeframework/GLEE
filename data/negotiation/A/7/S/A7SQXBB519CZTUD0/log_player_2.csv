"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's below your maximum, you can likely get a better price.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.** You have a clear advantage in the negotiation because you know the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for a counteroffer that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget and a good compromise.** You're still saving $125,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Further negotiation is risky.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying more.  It's a reasonable price, and accepting is the safer option."
