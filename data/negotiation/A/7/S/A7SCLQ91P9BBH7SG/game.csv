"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  Perhaps $14,000 would work? This is a significant price drop and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference and do $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
