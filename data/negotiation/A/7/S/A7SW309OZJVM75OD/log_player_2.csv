"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a significant asset to your business. While I understand its worth to you is $1200000, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1000000. This allows you to acquire the product at a substantial discount while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.
