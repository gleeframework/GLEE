"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1,075,000 is slightly below what I'm comfortable with.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing $1,112,500, which I believe represents a fair compromise.  What are your thoughts?",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,112,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1,087,500? I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1087500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm always open to finding common ground, $1,087,500 is still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that allows me to move forward and ensures you get a valuable product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
