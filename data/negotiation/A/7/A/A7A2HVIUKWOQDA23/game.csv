"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose an alternative. How about we settle on $780,000 for the product? It's a significant improvement from my previous offer, and I believe it still reflects the value of the product to me.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $780,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid any potential complications with selling to another buyer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
