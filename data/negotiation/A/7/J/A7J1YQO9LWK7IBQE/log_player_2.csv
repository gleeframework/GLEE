"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm looking for $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than her value for the product ($800,000) and leaves a lot of room for negotiation.  It's in your best interest to counter-offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still comfortably above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives us a better starting point.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  The message aims to come across as reasonable and open to negotiation, rather than confrontational.  This can help foster a more collaborative bargaining environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still significantly higher than her value and what we're willing to pay. We're getting closer, but continuing to negotiate is worthwhile.  We have room to go lower before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we settle at $975,000?  That would work for me."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Movement:** We're making a smaller counter-offer this time ($75,000 decrease), signaling that we are getting closer to our limit but still willing to negotiate.
* **Budget Justification:** Introducing a budget adds a level of firmness to our position without being confrontational.
* **Target Price:**  This counter-offer moves us closer to a price point where we might be willing to accept a compromise around $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is still a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

We are now at a point where Alice's offer is getting close to our potential compromise range. However, there are still a few rounds left, and we might be able to push her down a bit further before accepting or resorting to John's offer.  Every bit saved counts!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my maximum, but I think we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to agree to $1,015,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1015000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling a Limit:** We're now getting very close to Alice's last offer, signaling that we're nearing our upper limit.  
* **Small Concession:**  We're only offering a $35,000 decrease, showing that we're serious but still willing to negotiate a small amount.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone and emphasizes the value of the product, reinforcing our interest and willingness to close the deal. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and potentially closing the deal without resorting to John's significantly higher offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,015,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that this is her final offer. While it's a bit higher than we hoped, it's significantly less than John's offer. Continuing to negotiate at this point risks alienating Alice and could force us to accept John's much higher price.  This seems like the best deal we'll get."
