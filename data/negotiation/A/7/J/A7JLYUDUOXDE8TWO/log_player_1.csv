"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still leaving a profit margin for myself.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob responds to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair compromise and accepts. If not, we'll continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and it's more than what John is offering.  It's also a fair deal considering Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate.  I'd rather close the deal now and secure the profit, rather than risk losing out on the sale by continuing to negotiate."
