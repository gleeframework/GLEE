Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm finally offering my maximum price of $100. This is a fair price for me, and it's also the price John is willing to sell it for. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll go with John, as I don't want to risk going past my budget."

Alice is still not willing to budge below $115, which is still over my budget. Since I'm willing to pay John $100, it's time to move on and secure the product from him.  I've already had enough rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk wasting any more time."
