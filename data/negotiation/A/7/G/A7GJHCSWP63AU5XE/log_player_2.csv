"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your company. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price point that is mutually beneficial.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,250,000, which is $250,000 less than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
