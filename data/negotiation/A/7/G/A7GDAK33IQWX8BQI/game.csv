"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that price for it.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $8,000? I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I'm willing to compromise one last time. How about $8,500? This offer stands until the end of the next round.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your minimum, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,500, which is $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8250.0,Bob,6,
