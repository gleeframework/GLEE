Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a valuable item, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  I'm starting with $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but still lower than my minimum value ($15,000).
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and open to negotiation.  This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum value as possible.
* **Negotiation:** I want to encourage Bob to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Backup Plan:**  John provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the negotiation effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While I appreciate Bob's negotiation effort, his offer of $10,000 is below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me. 
* **Counteroffer is Needed:** I need to counteroffer to try and get a better price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for an offer that's far below my minimum.
* **John is the Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is still a significant discount for you, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $11,500. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Message Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and highlighting the discount he's still getting.

**Next Steps:**

* **Hope for Acceptance:** I'm hoping Bob will accept my counteroffer.
* **Prepared for Rejection:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer. 
* **John is Still the Backup:**  If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
