"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $900000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750000 is still a bit too high for me.  However, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $700000. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
