Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $19,000.  This offer is only valid for a short time before I move on to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely implies the product's high value and potential benefit to Bob, justifying the price somewhat.
* **Urgency:** By stating the offer is time-limited, you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important:** This strategy is based on the information provided. In a real negotiation, understanding Bob's needs, motivations, and potential alternatives would be crucial for tailoring a more effective offer."
