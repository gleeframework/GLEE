"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's valued at a minimum of $8000 for me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price of $10000.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $8500?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9000 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8750?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
