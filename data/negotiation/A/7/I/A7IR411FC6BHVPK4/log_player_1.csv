Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Potential for Profit:**  By aiming for $150, I'm seeking a 50% profit. While there's a chance Bob might reject this offer, I always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response will provide valuable information. If he accepts, great! If he negotiates, I'll know he's interested but wants a better price. If he outright rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John."
