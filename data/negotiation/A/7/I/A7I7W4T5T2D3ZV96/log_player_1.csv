Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much as possible from the sale, and Bob is willing to pay the market value. Offering a higher price initially allows room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob sees the value.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below that price.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $19,000 is a strong opening. It's significantly above my minimum, but not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. It leaves room for negotiation if needed."
