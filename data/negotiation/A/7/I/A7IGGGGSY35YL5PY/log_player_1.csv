Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my current budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing me to invest in this product while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
