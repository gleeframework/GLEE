"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $2000000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1200000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1800000 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1600000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
