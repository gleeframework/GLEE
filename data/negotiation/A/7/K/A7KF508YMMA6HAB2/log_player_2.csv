"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $800,000 to her, and she's offering it for $1,300,000. This is a significant markup. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, and your goal is to save money. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating. 
* **John is a backup option.** While his price is high, it provides a safety net in case negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000, reflecting the product's worth to you and the potential value for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,125,000. This reflects the product's worth and leaves a fair margin for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** While she lowered the price, it's still significantly above the product's worth to her.
* **There's still room to negotiate.** You have 7 rounds remaining, and you're aiming to get the price closer to your target.
* **John remains a backup option.** Having this alternative ensures you don't get stuck in a negotiation that isn't beneficial to you."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,037,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while ensuring a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1037500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $1,090,000? This recognizes the product's significant potential while providing you with a considerable return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target.**  While it's getting closer, it's still significantly higher than the $800,000 value to her.
* **You have room for more negotiation.**  There are 5 rounds left. By rejecting, you continue to pressure Alice to come down further.
* **John's offer is still a safety net.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still purchase the product from John. 

You want to keep pushing for a lower price, aiming for a deal closer to $1,000,000 or less."
