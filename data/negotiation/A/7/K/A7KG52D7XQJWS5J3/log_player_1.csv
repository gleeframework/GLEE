"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, as I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not going to sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to try and convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering my minimum price now, hoping to close the deal.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and Bob's repeated offers. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly stubborn and unwilling to compromise. I've already reached my minimum price, and he's still refusing to go higher. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price than I can get from John."
