"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to counter with a price of $120 for the product. This aligns closely with its value to you and also allows us to reach a fair agreement. We hope this meets your expectations and look forward to your response.",120.0,Alice,3,
