,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a much better price.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $18,000?  That's a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000?  That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500? This offer stands until the end of the day.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, I have a strict budget, and  $12,500 is still pushing it.  My final offer is $7,500. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option I have.",7500.0,Bob,6,
