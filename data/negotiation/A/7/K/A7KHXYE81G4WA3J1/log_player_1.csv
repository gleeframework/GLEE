Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while leaving the door open for further discussion. 

**Reasoning:**

By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm hoping to create some leverage. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then gauge his interest and potentially adjust my offer. However, if the negotiations drag on, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 

**Reasoning:**

Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me. Rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round allows me to attempt to negotiate a better price. While I'm not guaranteed to get my desired price, it's worth exploring further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$975,000:** This price is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable to him. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product while also expressing willingness to compromise. 

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to reach a mutually agreeable price.  By offering a counter-offer close to the middle ground, I'm showing flexibility while still protecting my own interests.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can then evaluate his seriousness and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $975,000 is closer, but still a little too high for my budget. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower.  I'm not willing to settle for that price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of a Lower Price:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss compared to what I could get from John. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  I have the safety net of John's offer, which ensures a profit that meets my minimum requirements. 

Given these factors, continuing the negotiation with Bob is a better strategy than accepting his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum price.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe the value of the product justifies this price.  Please let me know if you're able to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a slight compromise from my previous offer but still maintains a significant profit margin for me. It demonstrates flexibility while keeping the price closer to my minimum acceptable range.
* **Message:** The message expresses understanding of Bob's budget constraints but reaffirms the value of the product and the importance of reaching a price that is fair for both parties.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Signal Seriousness:** Offering a counter-offer shows that I am serious about selling to Bob but am also firm in my price expectations.
* **Close the Gap:** $950,000 is a price that could potentially bridge the gap between our expectations and lead to a successful deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I can re-evaluate my position and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
