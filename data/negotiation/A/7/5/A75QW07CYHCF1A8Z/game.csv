"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product, which is a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This would be a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1100000? This would be a fair price considering the potential value and would be a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your number, but $1100000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference at $1150000.  This would be a fair price considering the product's potential value and would be a mutually beneficial deal. ",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $1125000 for your product. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential value and the progress we've made in our negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1125000 is still a little below my target.  How about we settle at $1137500?  It's a small difference from your offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1137500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we split the difference at $1131250. This would be a fair price for both of us.
