Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible without going below my minimum price.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high offer ($11,999) aims to anchor the price in Bob's mind. While it's unlikely he'll accept immediately, it sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $12,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** It's crucial to present the offer in a way that highlights the value to Bob, not just my profit. 
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer is just the starting point. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob, potentially lowering the price slightly, but never going below $12,000."
