"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item at a special introductory price of $14000. We understand its value to you is $12000, but we hope this offer will be attractive enough for us to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,2,,
