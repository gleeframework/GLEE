"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaves room for Alice to counter. It also signals that I'm serious about buying the product but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further.  There's no rush to go to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This keeps the negotiation moving while slowly moving towards a price that works for me.  It shows I'm still interested and willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $110, which would be $117.50. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This price is within my acceptable range, and further haggling might annoy Alice. It's a good deal!"
