Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,380,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to your business.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to save a little more, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,370,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has gotten down to $1,370,000, and Bob has countered at $1,350,000.  It's likely that Alice will not come down to $1,350,000 and continuing to negotiate will only waste time.  John is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is a better price than Bob can get from Alice."
