You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'm comfortable paying $12,250, which is still a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000."
