"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,200,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial asking price, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I can try to get Alice closer to a price point that saves me even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation before reaching John's price of $1,000,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A significant counteroffer helps me understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Establish a lower target:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets a lower point for future negotiation, potentially leading to a more favorable final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my bottom line.  There's no point in further negotiation since I can buy the product for the same price from John without the risk of Alice changing her mind."
