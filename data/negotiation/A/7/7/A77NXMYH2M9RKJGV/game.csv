"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to consider your product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. Can you meet me halfway?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and offer you the product for $1,025,000.  This shows my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's seal the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $900,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll consider buying the product from John for $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,6,
