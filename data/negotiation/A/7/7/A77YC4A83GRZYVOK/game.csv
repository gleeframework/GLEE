"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to facilitate a deal.  This is still a great price considering the value it holds for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000.  This is a final offer, as I'm confident that the value I'm offering is more than worth it to you.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
