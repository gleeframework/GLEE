"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the value of the product can make Bob more receptive to paying a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob has shown interest, his low offer indicates he's trying to get a very good deal. There's still room for negotiation to reach a more agreeable price. 
* **Value of time:**  I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so I can afford to reject this offer and see if I can get a better one from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, perhaps $10,000, and explain why it's still a good deal for him, considering the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $5,000 is definitely below what I need to make this worthwhile,  I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and allows me to continue negotiating."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($5,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and why $9,000 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Maintain Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary, indicating I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $6,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's also below his own perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, so there's no rush to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my previous offer, perhaps $8,000, and emphasize the value of the product and the fact that I'm making a significant concession.  I will also remind him of the potential for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $6,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down further. How about we settle on $8,000?  This reflects the product's value and allows me to keep negotiating with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($6,500). This shows a commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value and the fact that this is a good deal for him. 
* **Leaving Room:**  By offering $8,000, I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary, but I'm also getting closer to my minimum value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation productive."
