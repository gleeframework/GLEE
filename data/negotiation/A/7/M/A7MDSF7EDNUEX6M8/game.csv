"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $14,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for a high-quality product like this. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a significant step up from my initial offer.  This is my final offer,  let's see if we can reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to have a more serious discussion. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
