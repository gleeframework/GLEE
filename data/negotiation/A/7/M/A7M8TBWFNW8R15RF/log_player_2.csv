Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $13500. It's a great price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, he still has some room to negotiate. He can try to lower the price further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and it's getting close to his limit with John.  While he could keep negotiating, the risk is that he'll run out of rounds and be stuck with a higher price than John's. It's more prudent to buy from John at this point."
