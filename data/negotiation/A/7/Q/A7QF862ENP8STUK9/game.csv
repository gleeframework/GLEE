"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is around $1,200,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This would still allow you to profit significantly from the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise and offer $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $895,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",895000.0,Alice,5,
