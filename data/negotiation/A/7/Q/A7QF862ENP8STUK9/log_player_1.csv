"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is around $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal within the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This would still allow you to profit significantly from the product's value."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise and offer $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price point, but I still think I can get a bit more. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him for a higher price, as I have a few more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $895,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 895000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers and propose $907,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $907,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $907,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $907,500 is very close to my last counteroffer of $895,000. It's a good deal, and with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the sale and settling for the $800,000 offer from John.  It's a good outcome to get this close to my initial target."
