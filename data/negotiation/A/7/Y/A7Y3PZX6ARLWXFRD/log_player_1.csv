Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Leave Bob Room:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it at $14,000 gives him space to negotiate up without feeling like he's already at his limit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob offered $10,500, which is more than his stated value of $10,000. This suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and John's guaranteed $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,250?"", ""product_price"": 12250}

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and closer to John's offer.
* **Strong Position:** By reminding Bob of the original asking price, it reinforces the idea that the product has a high value. 
* **Maintaining Options:** This keeps the negotiation alive while staying above the guaranteed sale price to John."
