Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, pricing it slightly below that ($999,999 or similar) is tempting but leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while staying above your minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

This strategy balances securing a sale with maximizing the potential profit from Bob."
