I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $15,000 to me and $12,000 to him. It leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still too low, although slightly better than his previous one. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $13,000, as it's crucial for me to get a reasonable profit. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
