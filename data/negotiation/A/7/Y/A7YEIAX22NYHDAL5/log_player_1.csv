Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $20,000. I know you'll love it, so let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to aim higher initially. Starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This means any offer accepted by Bob above $15,000 is a bonus.
* **Psychological Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number ($20,000), we potentially anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. This might make him more receptive to a slightly lower counter-offer (that's still above our minimum). 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  We need to be prepared to adjust our strategy based on Bob's response.  If he immediately rejects this offer, we can then propose a lower price, gradually moving closer to our minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
