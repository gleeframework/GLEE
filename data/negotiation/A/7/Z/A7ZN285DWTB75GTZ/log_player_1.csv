{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,500,000. I believe it has great potential for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to go up to $800000 at this point. This is my best offer, what do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a tough call, but I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or potentially from John. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to see if we can find common ground.  This is a fair price considering the potential of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $900000. I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's potential. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can push Bob a bit higher.  It's important to remember that John is still an option if I don't get a good deal from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs and the potential of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
