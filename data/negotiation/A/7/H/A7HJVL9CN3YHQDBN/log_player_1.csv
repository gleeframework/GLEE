"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell, $8,500 is still below my minimum. I believe I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's still significantly lower than my original asking price, and you're getting a product worth $8,000 to you for less.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still hesitant to accept. There's a chance I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds, and I want to explore those options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  I'm going to counter with $9,250. This is a good middle ground that allows us both to get a deal that's mutually beneficial.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9100 for the product, which is very close to your last offer. Let's aim for a final agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
