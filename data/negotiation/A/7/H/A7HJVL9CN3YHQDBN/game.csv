"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's still significantly lower than my original asking price, and you're getting a product worth $8000 to you for less.  Let's make this happen!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  I'm going to counter with $9250. This is a good middle ground that allows us both to get a deal that's mutually beneficial.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9100 for the product, which is very close to your last offer. Let's aim for a final agreement at this price.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but $9100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9150. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best possible price considering both our interests. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",9150.0,Alice,7,
