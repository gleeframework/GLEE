"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $9,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a fair price.  It's still within Bob's budget and a better price than buying from John. There's always a chance for further negotiation, but the risk of Alice backing out or Bob having to pay John's higher price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
