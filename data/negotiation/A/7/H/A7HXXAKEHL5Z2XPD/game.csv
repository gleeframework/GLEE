"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession on my end, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $937,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  If we don't, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",937500.0,Alice,5,
