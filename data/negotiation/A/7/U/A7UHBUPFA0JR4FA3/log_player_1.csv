"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with great potential.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product without revealing my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to determine my next move.  If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially adjust my strategy for future rounds. 
* I'll keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 at any time if the negotiations with Bob aren't fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a good price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I have the option to sell to John at the same price. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to get a better price. 
* **Strategic Move:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to hold firm and potentially earn more.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while also pushing for a better price.
* **Assess Bob's Willingness:** I'll carefully assess Bob's response to my counteroffer to understand his true level of interest and his maximum price point.
* **Option to Sell to John:** I'll continue to keep the option of selling to John in mind, as this provides a safety net in case negotiations with Bob stall."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the initial $1,000,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still emphasizing the unique value of the product to justify the price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $900,000  is a significant reduction from my starting offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully observe how Bob reacts to this counteroffer to gauge his commitment and potential for further negotiation.
* **Option to Sell to John:** As always, I'll remain aware of my option to sell to John at $800,000 if negotiations become unfavorable.
* **Strategic Adjustments:** Based on Bob's reaction and the remaining rounds, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly, potentially increasing or decreasing my counteroffers."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to the final three rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.
