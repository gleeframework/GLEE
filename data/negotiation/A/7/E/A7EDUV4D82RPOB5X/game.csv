"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit above $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $160, which would be $150. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,,
