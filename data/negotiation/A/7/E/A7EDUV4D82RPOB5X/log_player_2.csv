Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```
```tool_code
Explanation: Starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation.  You've countered with a price that's still within your budget and allows for potential compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

Explanation: You're moving closer to Alice's price while staying below your maximum budget. This shows willingness to negotiate but holds firm on getting a good deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit above $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $160, which would be $150. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

```tool_code
Explanation: Alice has come down to $150, which is the same price John is offering. At this point, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer since there's no guarantee you can negotiate a lower price, and it avoids the risk of her retracting the offer.
