"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $65 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $72.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",72.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $69 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $71.  Let's make this deal happen.",71.0,Alice,5,
