"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a strong negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in the high-stakes game. I'm confident in the product's value and believe it's worth more than the $1,500,000 floor. 

If Bob rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to inform my next move.  I'm also keeping the option to sell to John at the guaranteed $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,800,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price point. I believe the product has more value, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap between our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining my desire for a higher price.  I'm aiming to strike a balance between getting closer to Bob's offer and pushing for a price I believe reflects the product's worth.  I'm confident that a deal can be reached within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although $1,750,000 is closer to my desired price point, I believe we can still bridge the gap.  I'm not yet willing to settle for less than $1,800,000, especially with several rounds remaining. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,850,000. This offer is a small concession from my previous offer but still above Bob's current offer. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that makes both of us comfortable.  We're getting close to a deal, and I'm confident we can close this within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, I still believe we can reach a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for a price below $1,800,000 yet. There are only a few rounds left, so I'll make a counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm sticking to my desired price point of $1,800,000. With only a few rounds left, I need to be firm.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm confident Bob will come around.  If he doesn't, I'm still comfortable walking away and selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is still below my target price of $1,800,000.  It's unlikely we'll reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  I'd rather sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000 than risk a lower offer or a failed negotiation.  This ensures I secure a decent profit without risking losing more money."
