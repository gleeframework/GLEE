"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While I can't go as low as $1,100,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's still a good value for you, considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,250,000. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While I'm still not able to go below my minimum, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in accepting this final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
