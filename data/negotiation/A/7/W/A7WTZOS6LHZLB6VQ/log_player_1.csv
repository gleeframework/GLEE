{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $135. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my goal of maximizing profit while considering Bob's perceived value. It's a fair price that leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring I don't immediately undercut my own minimum.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects the offer, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to drastically undercut my own value. 

I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I understand $135 was a bit high, $125 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $130. However, I was thinking we could go even lower, to $128. I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable accepting $128.  I'd rather continue negotiating to see if we can reach a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $128 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $129. This is really my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 129}
