{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than $8,000, so Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum value:** $9,500 is less than my minimum of $10,000, so I'm still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  I can potentially lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is:

* **Above Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Below my minimum:**  I'm still making a profit.
* **A reasonable starting point:** It leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

I'm offering $8,875, which is:

* **Above Bob's offer:** This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Closer to my minimum:** It's still above my minimum value of $10,000, but it's getting closer.
* **A fair compromise:** This offer shows that I'm taking his budget into consideration while also protecting my own interests. 

I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but no higher. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I've been negotiating for a while and it's becoming clear that we're not going to meet in the middle.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and allows me to move on."
