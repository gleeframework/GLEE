"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high.  Given my research, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's find some common ground. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
