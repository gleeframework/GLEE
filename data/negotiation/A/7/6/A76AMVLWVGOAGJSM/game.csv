"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $85. How about we compromise at $92?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $88.  It's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go slightly below the middle ground, but I need $91 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position, but $91 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $89.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",89.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's say... $90.50",90.5,Alice,7,
