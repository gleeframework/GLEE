The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $85. How about we compromise at $92?

Alice's counter-offer is still above my target price of $85.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $88.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go slightly below the middle ground, but I need $91 to make it worth my while. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my target price, I can still try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's say... $90.50

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While $90.50 is close to my ideal price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $100.  This ensures I get the product without continuing to negotiate."
