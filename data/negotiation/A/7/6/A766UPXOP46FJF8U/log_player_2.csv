"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth paying $18,000 for a product you value at $15,000. You have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer, as I'm aiming to save as much as possible. I believe $13,000 is a reasonable starting point, given my valuation of $15,000 and Alice's valuation of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high, but closer to my target. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $14,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price. It's a compromise that could lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still too high, I'm not willing to pay that much. I will counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly again to $14,500. This is a compromise that shows Alice I'm still interested, but I'm not willing to go much higher. With only a few rounds left, it's time to push for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's price is still too high.  I've tried to negotiate, but we're not close to a deal.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely. I'm going to go with John's offer, even though it's not ideal, to ensure I get the product."
