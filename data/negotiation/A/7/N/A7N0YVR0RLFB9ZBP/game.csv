"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000 and I'm already willing to compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing we're getting close.  What if we split the difference and land at $11,375?",11375.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000 and I'm willing to compromise.",11500.0,Alice,7,
