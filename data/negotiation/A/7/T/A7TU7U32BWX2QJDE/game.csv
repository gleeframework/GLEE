"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $9,500?  That still leaves some room for me to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is still a little too low. Let's split the difference. How about $9,250? I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000 was too low, and $9,250 is too high. How about $9,100? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9100.0,Bob,6,
