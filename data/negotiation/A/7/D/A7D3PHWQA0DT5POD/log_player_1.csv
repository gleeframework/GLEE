Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.

Offering the product at $149 tempts Bob with a small ""discount"" while still securing almost the maximum profit for me. If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently sell to John without any loss."
