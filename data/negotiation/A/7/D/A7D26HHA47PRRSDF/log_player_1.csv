"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I think I can still get closer to my desired price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob seems firm on $10,500. It's a decent price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing him and ending up with nothing."
