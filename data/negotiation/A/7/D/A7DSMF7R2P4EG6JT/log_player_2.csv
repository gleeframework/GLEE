# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1400000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it at that price.
