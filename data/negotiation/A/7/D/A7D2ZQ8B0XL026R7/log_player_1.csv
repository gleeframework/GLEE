Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my highest possible price. I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so this is a high initial price that will hopefully make him want to negotiate. 

By giving him a message explaining the value of the product, I'm trying to subtly increase his perceived value of it, making him potentially more willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting my counteroffer by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing some willingness to compromise. This helps to keep the negotiation friendly and maintain a positive relationship.  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and his offer, which is a common tactic in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, my budget still doesn't allow me to reach $12,500. Could you consider lowering the price to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $11,000 is still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $11,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $11,500.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also reminding Bob about the value of the product to emphasize that this price is still fair."
