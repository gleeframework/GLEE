"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,500. Would that be something you'd consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to a deal, but $13,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $17,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",17000.0,Alice,5,
