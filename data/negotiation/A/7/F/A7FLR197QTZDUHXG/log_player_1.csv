Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $8,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $8,000.

By offering $14,000, I am:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  This price is significantly higher than my minimum value and closer to Bob's maximum value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob may be willing to negotiate a bit if he really wants the product. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** This price is high enough that Bob is likely to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
