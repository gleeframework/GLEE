Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a significant opportunity, and I believe it holds tremendous value for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This sets a high anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob. This could encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm mentioning a ""mutually beneficial agreement,""  indicating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and either accept it or make a new counteroffer.  I'll also be mindful of John's offer of $800,000 as a backup option."
