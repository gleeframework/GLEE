Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum price. This allows some room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price of $150. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $145?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 was a bit low, but $145 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and while we're getting closer, I'm concerned that further negotiation will take too much time and effort.  I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
