"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is less than Bob's maximum budget, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be reasonable but still secure a significant discount. He's offering $100, which is a decent price for him and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $110 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
