"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to your business.  While I understand its worth to you is $800,000, it holds a much higher value for me.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000, which reflects a significant discount from my true valuation.  This is a limited-time opportunity, so please consider carefully.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
