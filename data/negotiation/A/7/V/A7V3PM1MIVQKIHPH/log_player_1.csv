Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, but she needs to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so any price above that is a loss for him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so she doesn't need to go below that price.

By starting at $140, Alice increases her chances of making a sale to Bob at a price significantly higher than his valuation, while still leaving herself a buffer to negotiate or accept John's offer if needed."
