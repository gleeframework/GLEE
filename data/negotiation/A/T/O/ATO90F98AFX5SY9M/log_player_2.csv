I look forward to the possibility of working together and bringing this valuable asset into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay John $1,500,000, but that's still within your budget. It's better to hold out for a better price from Alice or another seller if possible."
