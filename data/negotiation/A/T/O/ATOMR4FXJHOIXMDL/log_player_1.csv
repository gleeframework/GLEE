Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price is fair considering both our positions and would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you say?
