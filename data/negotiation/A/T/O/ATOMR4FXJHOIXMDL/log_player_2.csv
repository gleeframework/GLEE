"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you've indicated it's worth that much to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000, it's not wise to accept her offer. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000? This price still leaves room for profit for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to your target."
