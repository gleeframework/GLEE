Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 tempts Bob with a price higher than his perceived value ($100) but still a ""good deal"" compared to my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to my $150 minimum. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for the guaranteed $150."
