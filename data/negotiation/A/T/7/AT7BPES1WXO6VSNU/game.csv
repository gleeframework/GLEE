,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $130?  It's a good price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  It's a fair price and closer to what I can afford right now.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $110 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference.  How about $120?  That way we both get a good deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
