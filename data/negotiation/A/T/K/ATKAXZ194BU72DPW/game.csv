"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $180. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $120, so how about $130? That's the lowest I can go.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet in the middle at $145? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer of $145, so how about $137.50? That's the lowest I can go.",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $137.50. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet in the middle at $142.50? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",142.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really sorry, Alice, but $142.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $137.50, so how about $140? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I've already made several concessions, and I think it's time to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $147, which is still a good deal for both of us.",147.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $147 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $140, so how about $142.50? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",142.5,Bob,10,
