"Bob,  I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower than my last offer, but $1,125,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
