"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its incredible potential and worth, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above both our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""incredible potential"" without explicitly stating what that is. This creates an air of value and invites Bob to see the product's worth beyond his initial assessment. 
* **Openness:**  While starting high, we signal that we're open to negotiation with ""but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."" This encourages Bob to engage in the discussion rather than feeling immediately put off by the high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's value, $2,250,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than our minimum but still significantly below what John is offering. We have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. We'll use the next counteroffer to steer the price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $1,250,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher, as reflected in the initial price.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Bob's offer as ""respectable"" to maintain a positive tone, but reiterate that it doesn't reflect the product's true value.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We make a significant concession from our initial price, but not so much that it brings us too close to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Anchoring:** By repeatedly mentioning the ""true value"" and emphasizing our compromise, we aim to anchor Bob's perception around a higher price point. 
* **Urgency:**  We haven't explicitly mentioned John, but we want to keep the negotiation moving and avoid getting stuck at a low price for too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or that the negotiations could drag on. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and a quick close."
