"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, there's a possibility of getting it for even less. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can explore further negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob considering his maximum budget of $15,000 and the option to buy from John for that amount.  Further negotiation may result in a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting and walking away.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without further risk."
