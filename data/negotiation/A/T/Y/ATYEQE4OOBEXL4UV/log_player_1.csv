Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you are subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying a higher price. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might lose out if he doesn't take this offer, even though you have John as a backup. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
