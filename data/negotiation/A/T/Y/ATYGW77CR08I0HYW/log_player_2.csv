"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and try to reach a price closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my target, it's still not ideal. I'm still within my budget and have room to negotiate further.  I'll try to counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This price is closer to my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession to finalize the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to my target, it's still $25,000 above my ideal price. I've already made several counteroffers, and Alice's concessions have been minimal.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures I get the product at my target price and avoids further negotiation."
