"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We start high ($1,100,000) to anchor the negotiation closer to our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer as a beneficial opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point for negotiations"" signals our willingness to engage in further discussion and potential price adjustments.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how eager he is to purchase and how flexible he might be on price.
2. **Maintain a strong position:** Starting high gives us leverage in subsequent rounds. 
3. **Leave open the possibility of a quick deal:** There's a chance Bob might accept the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While we want to negotiate, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. We have a strong alternative in John, who's ready to pay our desired price. We'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,050,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but with firmness:** We are making a concession of $50,000 from our initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, we're holding firm well above his initial offer, emphasizing that $850,000 is simply not acceptable.
* **Justification:**  We're re-emphasizing the product's value to counter Bob's attempt to anchor the price too low.
* **Maintaining a strong alternative:** By keeping our counteroffer relatively high, we signal that walking away and selling to John is still a very real possibility if Bob isn't willing to meet us closer to our price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $850,000, which is far below our acceptable range.  His statement about exploring other options could be a bluff, and even if it's not, we have a strong alternative with John. We'll reject this offer and send a counteroffer that shows flexibility but maintains our bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're reaching a critical point in this negotiation. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,000,000, but this is my absolute final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end while ensuring the product's value is acknowledged.  I believe it's a fair deal, and I need a decision from you now to proceed."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** By framing this as our ""absolute final offer,"" we're creating a sense of urgency and emphasizing the need for Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Significant but calculated concession:** The $50,000 reduction from our previous counteroffer is substantial, showing Bob we're flexible. However, we're still well above his $850,000 and closer to our minimum acceptable price.
* **Clear expectation:** We explicitly state we need a decision from Bob ""now,"" putting the ball in his court and implying we might walk away if he doesn't accept.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Elicit a response:** We need to see if Bob is willing to budge from his position or if he's truly unwilling to move.
2. **Maintain control:** By setting a firm deadline and limit, we're guiding the negotiation and preventing it from dragging on with little progress. 
3. **Prepare for a potential exit:**  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, we're mentally ready to walk away and sell to John for our desired price."
