"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the product's potential.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,050,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're reaching a critical point in this negotiation. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,000,000, but this is my absolute final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end while ensuring the product's value is acknowledged.  I believe it's a fair deal, and I need a decision from you now to proceed.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
