"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $16000, which would be $14000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $14500, which is a bit above your latest offer but still below my minimum. Let's see if we can meet on this price.",14500.0,Alice,7,
