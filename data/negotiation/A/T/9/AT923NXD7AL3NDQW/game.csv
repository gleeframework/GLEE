,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $90 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $70?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, Bob. But I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $77.50?",77.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $77.50. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,7,
