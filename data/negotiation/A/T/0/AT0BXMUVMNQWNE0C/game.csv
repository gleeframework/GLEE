"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice. I agree the product has value, but I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  The product can generate substantial returns for your business, and I'm confident that my revised offer reflects a fair deal for both of us. Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value proposition, Alice, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,175,000 is still under my initial target, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,250,000? This reflects my commitment to making this work.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're right, Alice, we are getting close.  I appreciate your flexibility. How about we land at $1,200,000 even? That feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
