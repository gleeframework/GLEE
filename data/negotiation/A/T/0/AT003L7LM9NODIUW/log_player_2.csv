# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special and I know it'll be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still allows me to make a good profit and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.
