"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she is offering it for $125. This means there is room for negotiation. Since the product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $130, it's still above Bob's desired price range. There is still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to make counteroffers."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $135, which is getting closer to Bob's maximum price point of $150. However, Bob has already made two counteroffers and it's unlikely that Alice will come down much further.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $150. This guarantees the purchase and avoids further potential negotiation rounds that may not result in a better price."
