"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
