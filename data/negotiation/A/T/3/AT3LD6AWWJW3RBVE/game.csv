"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $100 is a bit steep for me, how about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85?"
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'll counteroffer at $92. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for countering, Alice. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $92 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we settle at $70?",70.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but $70 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $82?"
"I'm not willing to go as low as $82, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think a fair price for this product is $88. What do you think?",88.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $82.50, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price, and I think you'll love the product.",82.5,Alice,7,,
