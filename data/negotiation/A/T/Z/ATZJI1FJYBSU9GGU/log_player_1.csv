Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe its value will far exceed the price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to earn an extra $100,000 if Bob accepts the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $1,100,000 creates a substantial profit margin while still offering Bob a price significantly lower than its worth to me. This makes it a tempting deal for Bob.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims for a collaborative tone, inviting Bob to consider the offer and potentially negotiate further. 
 
This approach balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John."
