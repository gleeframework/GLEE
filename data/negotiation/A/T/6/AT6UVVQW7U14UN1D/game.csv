"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go above $10,000.  Is there any flexibility at all?",10000.0,Bob,4,
