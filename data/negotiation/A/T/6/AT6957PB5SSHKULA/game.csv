"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would that work for you?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. However, $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $125? It's a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $117.50?",117.5,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, $117.50 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about we meet at $122.50? It's a bit above my minimum, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",122.5,Alice,7,
