"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has tremendous value for you, given its potential to generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective needs.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's desired price point.  This offer is still better than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While there might be a slight chance Bob could get a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his next offer and pushing the price closer to John's is not worth the potential savings.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
