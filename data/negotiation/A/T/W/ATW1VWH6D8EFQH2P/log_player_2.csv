"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $80. I believe this price is fair and competitive, while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $75 is below your maximum value of $80, so it's a good deal for you. There's no need to risk further negotiation or pay the higher price from John."
