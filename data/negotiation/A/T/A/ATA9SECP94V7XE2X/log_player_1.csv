Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to offer $850000.  I believe this price reflects the true market value and allows both of us to benefit from a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
