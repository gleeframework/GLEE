"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to offer $850000.  I believe this price reflects the true market value and allows both of us to benefit from a successful transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than $850000.  It has the potential to generate significant returns for you, far exceeding the initial investment. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $875000. This price is fair and allows us both to find a mutually beneficial solution.",875000.0,Bob,4,
