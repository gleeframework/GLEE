Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to $12,000, which is a better deal than buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's a bit higher than his previous counteroffer, but it's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $15,000. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
