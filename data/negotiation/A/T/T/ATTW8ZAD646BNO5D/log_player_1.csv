Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This allows some room for negotiation, but also shows that I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum.  I'm confident that Bob, who values the product at $8,000, might be willing to pay a bit more to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm not getting my ideal price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting.  It's better than selling to John for the same price, and I'm not sure I can push for a higher offer with Bob."
