"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $9,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'd like to buy the product from you for $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. ",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'll offer $10,000. Can we discuss further?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000. It's a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10,500. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still being a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,500, so I'll offer $10,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10250.0,Bob,6,
