"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to go below $1,200,000. Let me make you a counteroffer: $1,200,000 is still on the table, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional service offer, but it doesn't quite bridge the gap for me. To be frank, I'm working with a budget of $1,100,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $1,150,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not including any extras this time, just the product at the agreed-upon price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close.  I can tell we both want to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,125,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. I can do $1,150,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
