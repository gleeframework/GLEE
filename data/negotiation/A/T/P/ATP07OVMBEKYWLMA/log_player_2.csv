# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to go below $1,200,000. Let me make you a counteroffer: $1,200,000 is still on the table, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice is not budging on price, even with the added service (which may or may not hold actual value to us).  It's time to push back a bit firmer, but still leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the additional service offer, but it doesn't quite bridge the gap for me. To be frank, I'm working with a budget of $1,100,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $1,150,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not including any extras this time, just the product at the agreed-upon price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting close! Alice is clearly willing to negotiate now, so let's see if we can push a little further down towards our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is getting very close.  I can tell we both want to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,125,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. I can do $1,150,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice seems firm on her $1,150,000 offer and has labeled it as final. While we'd prefer to get closer to $1,125,000, continuing to push risks:

* **Stalemate:**  Alice might not budge, wasting precious rounds.
* **Losing the deal:** She could walk away entirely, forcing us to John's less favorable price.

Accepting at $1,150,000 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the potential downsides of further negotiation."
