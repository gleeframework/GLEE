"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $15,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,500 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This is a fair compromise and a good price for such a valuable product.  What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,625 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,625 is still not quite there for me.  We've been working towards a deal, and I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $14,000. Let's try $13,900 - this is a small difference, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",13900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $13,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,450 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13450.0,Bob,8,
