"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still below my minimum desired amount ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while also setting a strong initial position. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum desired amount, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room to reach a more favorable price for me.  
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** I'll keep the option of selling to John open in case the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,200,000 is a bit low for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still holding firm to a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and trying to create a win-win situation. 
* **Maintain Selling to John Option:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John open in case Bob again rejects my offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product is well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still below my desired $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is almost over:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to secure a better price. 
* **John is still a good option:** I have the security of selling to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum.
