"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with the market value and would be a more comfortable fit for my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1,400,000 is a respectable offer, it's significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's unique benefits and potential for growth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,550,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget constraints.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
