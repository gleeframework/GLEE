"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $750000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while also staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I understand you're on a budget, but I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $800000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
