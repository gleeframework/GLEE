"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $95. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $70 for it. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price, considering the value this product holds for you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you can't go as low as $70, Alice. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $78? It's a good deal for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $78 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81? It's a fair price that would allow us to both walk away happy.",81.0,Alice,5,
