Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for potential concessions and still secures a significant profit if Bob accepts immediately. 
* **Slightly Below Bob's Value:** Offering the product at $110 is slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120), making it more enticing for him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $110, there's space to potentially negotiate down to a price that's still very profitable for you (above your minimum of $80)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent profit, it's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $120. There's room to negotiate for a better price. I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $105, I'm splitting the difference between Bob's offer ($95) and my previous asking price ($110). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm not drastically lowering my price, signaling that I believe in the product's value and am willing to walk away if a suitable agreement can't be reached. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity, keeping the negotiation moving smoothly."
