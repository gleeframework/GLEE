"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While I am happy with selling to John, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $8,600, which would be a good middle ground for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer is getting closer and it's only round 4. I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and then having to settle with John for a lower price than what I could have gotten from Bob."
