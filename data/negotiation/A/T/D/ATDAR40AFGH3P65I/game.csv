"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $8,600, which would be a good middle ground for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
