"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness and quality of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. Would you consider lowering the price to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1000000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
