"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it holds significant potential for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, just as it is to me.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,550,000.  This is a very fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
