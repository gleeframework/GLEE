Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be very valuable to you! I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (still above Alice's minimum) if he's inclined. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning listing the product publicly implies that this is a limited-time offer, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure a sale with Bob at a price significantly higher than her guaranteed sale to John, while still maintaining the possibility of a successful deal."
