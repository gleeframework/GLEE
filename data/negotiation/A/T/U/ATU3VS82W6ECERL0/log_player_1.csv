Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it at a special price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he gets you to come down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing, you're implying the price could go higher, making $12,000 seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room:** While $12,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly below your guaranteed sale to John. This allows for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price he might find palatable."
