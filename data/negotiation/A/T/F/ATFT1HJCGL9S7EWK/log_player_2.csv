"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,600,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  However, I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it from me for $1,500,000. So, the choice is yours. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is trying to bluff you into paying above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price."
