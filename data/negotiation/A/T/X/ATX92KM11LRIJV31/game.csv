"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $7000? I'm serious about purchasing this product, and I believe this price reflects its fair value.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8000 is still slightly higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a price of $7800. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
