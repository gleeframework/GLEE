Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
