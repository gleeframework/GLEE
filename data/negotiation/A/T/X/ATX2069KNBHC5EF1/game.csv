"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,100,000 is cutting it too close. I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,150,000. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
