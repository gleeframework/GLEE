"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $160? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $160 is too low for me. Could you do $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
