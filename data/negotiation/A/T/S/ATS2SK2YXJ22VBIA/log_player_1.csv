Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower. You aim to get the maximum value from the sale.
* **Direct Approach:** The message is straightforward. It highlights the value but doesn't reveal your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""one-time offer"" phrasing adds a touch of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While Bob might value the product less, there's a chance he might be willing to pay $10,000 if he perceives its value differently or needs it urgently."
