# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $15000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. It's a good compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?
