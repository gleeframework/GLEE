"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me, considering what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $85. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider that?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $82 for the product. That's a significant drop from my original offer, and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. Can you consider that?",79.0,Bob,6,
