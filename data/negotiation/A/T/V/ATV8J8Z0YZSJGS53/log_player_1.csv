Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $120."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
