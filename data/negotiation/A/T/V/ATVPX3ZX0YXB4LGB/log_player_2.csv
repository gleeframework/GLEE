"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to make a counteroffer. After considering your proposal, I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,500.  Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to take that offer."
