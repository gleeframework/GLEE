{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer gives me a $1,000 profit over my minimum price, while still potentially leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept, but I'm prepared to counter-offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I won't accept a loss. I'm going to counter-offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $10,000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and we can finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking losing the sale and having to deal with John. This deal secures my minimum profit, and I can always try to negotiate a better price next time."
