"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing my own minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates a budget limitation, not necessarily his absolute maximum. I'm willing to counter to see if I can secure a higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budgetary concerns, Bob.  However, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and am willing to move from my initial price to demonstrate flexibility.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Proposing $1,350,000 splits the difference between our previous offers, signaling fairness and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterating Value:** I subtly emphasize the product's value again to justify the higher price point.

By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward and potentially secure a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,325,000 is a significant profit, exceeding my minimum by a substantial margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. Each round brings me closer to potentially settling for John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to utilize the earnings sooner. 

Bob is clearly demonstrating his interest and has met me closer to my price than his initial offer. Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with a willing buyer."
