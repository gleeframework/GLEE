"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost.  I could consider a price closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your thoughts. While $22,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true worth of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget. I could possibly go up to $9,000, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your honesty about your budget constraints. I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we try $14,000? This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still pushing it for me.  I'd be willing to stretch my budget to $10,000, but that's really the absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering the same for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is fixated on John's offer and unwilling to budge beyond his perceived value of $10,000.  While we're getting closer to a deal, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his $10,000 would be a $5,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  

It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
