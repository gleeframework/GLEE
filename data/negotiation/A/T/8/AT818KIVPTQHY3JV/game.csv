"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost.  I could consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your thoughts. While $22,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget. I could possibly go up to $9,000, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your honesty about your budget constraints. I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we try $14,000? This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to make this deal happen.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still pushing it for me.  I'd be willing to stretch my budget to $10,000, but that's really the absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering the same for that price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
