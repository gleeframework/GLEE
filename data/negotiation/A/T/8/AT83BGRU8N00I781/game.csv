"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the detailed explanation of the product's capabilities.  While I recognize its potential,  $1500000 is at the upper limit of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in its potential benefits, while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
