"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you. This innovative solution is designed to revolutionize your business operations and significantly increase efficiency. Given its cutting-edge capabilities and unparalleled benefits, we believe it is worth more than $1200000 to us. However, to facilitate a fair negotiation process, I am initially offering the product at a price of $1500000. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you would like to discuss other terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting. By rejecting, I can try to negotiate a lower price. If the negotiation fails, I can still buy from John for the same price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the detailed explanation of the product's capabilities.  While I recognize its potential,  $1,500,000 is at the upper limit of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in its potential benefits, while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
