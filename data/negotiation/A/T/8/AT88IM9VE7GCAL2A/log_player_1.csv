"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I'm getting a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the benefits of the deal for both parties. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for multiple rounds of negotiation, as Bob will likely counteroffer and we can work towards a mutually acceptable price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet. I still have 8 rounds left and I'm hoping to get a better price. I can use this round to send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  It's still a good value for you, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has come closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept his offer.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident I can squeeze out a bit more.  With 6 rounds left, I'm willing to keep pushing for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still a little short of my target. Let's try $1,125,000.  It's a small increase from your last offer, but it helps me reach a price point I can work with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your budgetary constraints. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are down to two rounds left, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that we are not going to reach an agreement that meets my needs.  Since I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, it's in my best interest to end the negotiations with Bob and accept John's offer."
