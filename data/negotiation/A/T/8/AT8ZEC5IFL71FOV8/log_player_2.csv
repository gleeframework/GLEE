"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob has a clear advantage here, as he can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails. This allows Bob to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to make a significant move to show Alice he's serious about a lower price.
* **Strategic midpoint:**  $850,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum price of $800,000.  
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  This gives Alice room to counter without dropping below her minimum, while also pushing Bob towards his goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's lower than her previous offer, but it's still not within Bob's desired range.
* **Further negotiation is possible.**  The gap between Bob's counteroffer ($850,000) and Alice's offer ($900,000) is now smaller.  There's likely room for both parties to compromise.
* **John is still an option.**  Bob can still buy from John if this negotiation fails, so he has leverage to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise but still staying below $900,000. 
* **Middle ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between the last two offers.  It's a reasonable compromise that may lead to an agreement.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The offer is still below Alice's minimum profit, reminding her that John is always a viable alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's last counteroffer, and significantly lower than her initial price.
* **Close to the target:** $890,000 is within a reasonable range of Bob's desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a chance Alice could reject further counteroffers, potentially leading to buying from John at a higher price. 

Given the progress and the potential risk of further negotiation, accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice for Bob at this point."
