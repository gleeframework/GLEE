Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he has room to meet me in the middle and still get a good deal. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm sticking with a firm price close to my desired amount. This counteroffer shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin. Bob rejected my initial offer, but he offered a price closer to my minimum, so there's a clear path for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob. I'm not willing to settle for a lower price just yet. I believe there's still potential for a better deal."

I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.  This price is still above my minimum and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in reaching a deal and accept this offer."
