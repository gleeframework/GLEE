Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's estimated value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, hoping to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation, which makes Bob feel like he has some power in the process.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** I'm aiming for a price as close as possible to Bob's perceived value.
* **Avoid unnecessary counter-offers:** By starting high, I hope to minimize back and forth negotiation and reach a deal quicker.
* **Maintain optionality:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is still a significant amount, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely secure a better price than Bob's current offer.
* **Maintaining optionality:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. If that fails, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a substantial profit for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not sticking to my initial high price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation for both of us, highlighting the potential profit for Bob.
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in too quickly. $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Achieve a higher price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired price point.
* **Signal flexibility:** I'm showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also willing to stand firm on my bottom line.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  My counteroffer invites Bob to respond and potentially move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
