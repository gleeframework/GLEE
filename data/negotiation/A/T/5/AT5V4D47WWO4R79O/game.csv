"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand this product has value, Alice, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we could both be happy with the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
