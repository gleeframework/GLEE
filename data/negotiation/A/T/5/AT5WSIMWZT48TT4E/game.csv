"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more than $8,500 to let this product go. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's close the deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $8,500, but $9,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
