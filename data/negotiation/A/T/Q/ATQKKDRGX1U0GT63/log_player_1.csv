"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  My price is $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm phrasing the message in a way that invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. While I could sell to John for this price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to $140. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $130?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us, making it more appealing than simply stating a price.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By offering a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation going and preventing a potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $125, as I believe that is a fair price given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my desired price of $140.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk Bob getting frustrated and walking away, or potentially losing the deal to John.
* **Time is Limited:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to capitalize on a good offer. 

While I would prefer $140, accepting $125 is a good outcome, especially considering the limited rounds and the risk of getting a lower price or losing the deal entirely."
