"Alice, your offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
