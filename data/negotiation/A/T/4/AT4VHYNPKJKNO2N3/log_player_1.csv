Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal, but let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  While Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to pay slightly more.  This offer helps gauge his interest and potential budget. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120.  This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
