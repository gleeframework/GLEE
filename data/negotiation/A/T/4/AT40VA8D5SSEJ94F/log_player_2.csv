Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. While I understand your position, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers you significant value, and I believe a price closer to $20,000 is more reflective of that.  Are you open to reconsidering?
