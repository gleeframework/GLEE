"Alice, $25,000 is definitely too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. While I understand your position, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers you significant value, and I believe a price closer to $20,000 is more reflective of that.  Are you open to reconsidering?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $20,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
