# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth that much to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details.  Otherwise, I'll be selling it to someone else for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
