"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth paying $150 when you have a guaranteed option to buy it for $100 from John.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer, aiming for a price that's more in line with my budget. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and we'll see how Alice responds."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm moving closer to Alice's offer, but still below my price limit. This shows good faith while keeping the pressure on."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice is not budging much, and at $125, I'm getting closer to my limit. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
