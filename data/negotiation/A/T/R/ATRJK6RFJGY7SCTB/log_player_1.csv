"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me a good sense of Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm going to reject it for now. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can push for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum value.  I hope to find a middle ground that we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $85. While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and we're now at a price that's above my minimum and worth the risk of continuing.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard."
