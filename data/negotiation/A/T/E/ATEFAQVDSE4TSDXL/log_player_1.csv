I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my target."

```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. While I'd like to get more money for it, I've already been negotiating with Bob for several rounds and it seems like he's not willing to budge much more.  It's better to secure the sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement than risk continuing the negotiation and ending up with less."
