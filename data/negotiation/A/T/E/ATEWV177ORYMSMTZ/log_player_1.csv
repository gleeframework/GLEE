Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $135 allows for some negotiation room while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value of $120.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than the asking price, which might make Bob more inclined to accept. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price of $150. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
