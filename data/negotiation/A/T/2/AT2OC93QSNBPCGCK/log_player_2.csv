Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $11,250 for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Negotiating further presents a risk of her sticking to this price or even increasing it.  It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000, ensuring you stay within your budget."
