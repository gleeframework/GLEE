Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $60. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $85. This is closer to my minimum value, but still leaves a little room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob is willing to pay a bit more after rejecting my initial offer, especially since selling to John would only net me $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $75. While it's still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's a reasonable compromise. Selling to John would only yield me $80, and further negotiation with Bob might not result in a higher price.  It's better to secure the sale now and move on."
