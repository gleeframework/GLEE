"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than her valuation of the product ($1,200,000). There's room for negotiation. While I have a budget of $1,500,000, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to Alice's valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,250,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I've started by acknowledging Alice's offer and the product's value. My counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial asking price but still leaves room for further negotiation. By positioning my offer as a firm ""willing to purchase"" price, I signal seriousness while also leaving the door open for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, I can't let this product go for less than $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above her valuation. I suspect there's more room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer maintains pressure on Alice while keeping me within my budget. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground between our last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** By suggesting the middle ground, I signal that I'm genuinely interested in reaching a fair agreement.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:**  Stating I'm ""ready to close"" adds a subtle time pressure, potentially pushing Alice to accept. 
* **Remains strategic:**  My offer is still comfortably below my maximum budget and above Alice's valuation, leaving room for a final concession from either side if needed."
