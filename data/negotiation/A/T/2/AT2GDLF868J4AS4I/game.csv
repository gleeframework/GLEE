"Alice, that's a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $14,000? I'm really interested in this product, but that's my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",17000.0,Alice,5,
