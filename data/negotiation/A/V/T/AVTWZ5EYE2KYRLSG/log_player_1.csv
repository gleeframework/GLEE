Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 gives me room to negotiate downwards while still getting a good price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Showing flexibility can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message builds rapport and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will pay $80 provides a safety net and gives me confidence in walking away from a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $90 is only $10 less than my initial offer and significantly higher than John's offer of $80.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and eliminates the possibility of further negotiation that could result in a lower price or a rejection from Bob.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob could walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80."
