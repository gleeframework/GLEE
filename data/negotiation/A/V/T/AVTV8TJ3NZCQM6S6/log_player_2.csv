"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,750. This is my final offer in this range. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $12,750 is still above his $10,000 limit.  It's a better deal to purchase from John at a guaranteed price."
