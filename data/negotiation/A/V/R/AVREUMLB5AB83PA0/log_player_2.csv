"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure you'd be able to make good use of it. I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price lower than its true worth, and I get a fair price for something that's important to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
