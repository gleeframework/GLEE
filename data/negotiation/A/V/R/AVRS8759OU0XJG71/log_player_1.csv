"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $107.50? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $107.50 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I am willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I also want to avoid selling to John at this point, as I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate that.  However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to go down to $112.50,  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $110? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation isn't progressing fast enough to reach my desired price.  While $110 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  John offers a guaranteed $150, so it's the more financially secure option at this point."
