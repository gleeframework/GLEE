"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$60 is way too low for me. I'm not going to accept that. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $125. This is still a good profit for me and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$75 is still not a good price for me. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob.  I'm hoping he'll come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm willing to drop the price to $110. This is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping Bob will see the value in this product and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've had enough of Bob's lowball offers. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120.  This is a decent deal and it saves me any further frustration with Bob."
