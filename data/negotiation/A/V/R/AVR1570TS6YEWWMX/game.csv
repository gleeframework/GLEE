"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm offering the product to you for $10,800. This is my final offer.",10800.0,Alice,5,
