"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. While it's lower than her product valuation, it's still more than I want to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target a good deal:**  My goal is to get the product as close to my $10,000 maximum as possible, ideally saving some money.
* **Don't lowball initially:**  While I could go lower, starting with a $3,000 decrease might seem unreasonable to Alice and discourage negotiation. A $9,000 offer shows I'm serious but looking for a fair price.
* **Leave room to negotiate:** This counteroffer leaves space for Alice to counter again if she's unwilling to go that low. We can then potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is negotiating:** Alice coming down to $11,000 shows she's willing to bargain.  
* **Closer to my limit:** While $11,000 is better, it's still above my ideal price, and very close to my absolute limit. 
* **Room for improvement:** I'll make one more counteroffer, aiming slightly under my $10,000 maximum to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This offer meets Alice halfway between her current offer ($11,000) and my previous counteroffer ($9,000).
* **Slightly under budget:**  It allows me to stay under my $10,000 limit while still leaving a small margin for Alice to potentially accept.
* **Final attempt:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely go with John. It's unlikely I can get a better deal from Alice at this point without going over my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm offering the product to you for $10,800. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Her ""final offer"" and small concession tell me she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Above budget:**  Even with her discount, $10,800 is still above my $10,000 limit.
* **John is the safer option:** I've reached the point where further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better result than John's guaranteed price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
