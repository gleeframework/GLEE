"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price reflects the market value and allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is below my acceptable threshold. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This ensures a win-win scenario for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  How about $975,000?  This compromise allows us both to secure a good deal while ensuring a smooth transaction.",975000.0,Bob,4,
