"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I am offering it at a special introductory price of $11,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a product worth $12,000 at an attractive discount. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to push for a lower price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am prepared to consider a price closer to your offer. Therefore, I am now offering the product at $10,750. This is a price higher than your counteroffer but still below the original asking price. I hope this proposal is more acceptable and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and is only $250 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob and saves him a significant amount of money.  It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much lower price."
