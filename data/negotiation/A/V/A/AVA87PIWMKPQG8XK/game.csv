"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
