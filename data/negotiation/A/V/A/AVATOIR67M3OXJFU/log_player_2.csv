"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer** means you pay $1,100,000, which is less than the $1,200,000 you'd pay to John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** and buying from John is a worse outcome, as it costs more.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
