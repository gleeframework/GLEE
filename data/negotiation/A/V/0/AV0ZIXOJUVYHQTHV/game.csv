"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you than that.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good value considering the product's benefits.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my costs.",11200.0,Alice,5,
