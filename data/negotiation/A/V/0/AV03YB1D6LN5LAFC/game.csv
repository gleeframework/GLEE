"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I've already assigned to the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value we both see in this deal, and it's closer to what I can afford.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $12000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I've already assigned to the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
