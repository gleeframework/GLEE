**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging significantly and seems fixated on a price well above your upper limit. You've already shown willingness to compromise, reaching a final offer of $1,000,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will get you close enough to your desired price range. Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you the product at your target price."
