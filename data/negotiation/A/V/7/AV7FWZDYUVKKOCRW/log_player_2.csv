Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $1,150,000 is a good price for me. It's still a significant savings compared to John's price, and I don't want to risk Alice getting upset and walking away from the deal completely."
