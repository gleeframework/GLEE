"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $12000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. Would you be willing to consider $13500?  This would give us both a good deal, and we could finalize the transaction quickly.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
