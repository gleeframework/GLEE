Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1100000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $950000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
