"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make an offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we settle at $1,500,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a good deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make an offer of $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
