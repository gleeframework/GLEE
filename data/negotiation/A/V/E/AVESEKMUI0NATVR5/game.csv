"I appreciate your initial offer, and I'm excited about the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a stronger return on investment.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1050000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm counteroffering at $1075000.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1050000. However, I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a comprehensive support package and a 5-year warranty. If you're willing to include those, I'd be willing to meet you at $1050000. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I like your creative thinking, Bob. The additional perks you're asking for are certainly valuable, but I'm not willing to give them away for free. I'm willing to include them in the deal, but I need to get a better price for the product itself. I'm counteroffering at $1075000, and I'll throw in the comprehensive support package and 5-year warranty as part of the deal. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can make a deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck. I want to be upfront with you - my budget for this product is $1050000, and I'm not willing to go above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to know that I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1050000, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can we meet in the middle?",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I respect that. However, I've got to prioritize getting the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to get something extra in return. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, but I want an additional 5% discount on the total price if you agree to a 2-year maintenance contract on top of the comprehensive support package and 5-year warranty. This way, I'll still get a good deal, and you'll get the benefits of a long-term partnership. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
