"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $11,200? This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,900 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go to $11,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,950 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
