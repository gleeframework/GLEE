Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it also gives you a significant saving compared to your initial assessment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
