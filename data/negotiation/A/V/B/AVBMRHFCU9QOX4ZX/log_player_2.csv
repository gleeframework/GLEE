"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it also gives you a significant saving compared to your initial assessment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has met your walk-away price. There's no benefit to haggling further or going with John, as they both offer the same price now."
