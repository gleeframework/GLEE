Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Price:** You know Bob values the product at $120, so any offer above that has a chance of acceptance.
* **Minimum Price:** You have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John.
* **Negotiation Power:** By starting at $145, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation and close to your guaranteed offer."
