"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price, making it more likely she'll accept the deal rather than risk losing a sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $12,500, which is closer to Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a lower price than John's, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price."
