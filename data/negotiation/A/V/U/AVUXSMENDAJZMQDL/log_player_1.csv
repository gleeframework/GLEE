Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than $80, giving Bob room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still earning more than your $120 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's unlikely Bob will accept this price outright, giving you a chance to bargain. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you'll have to decide if his counteroffer is acceptable or if you're better off selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum price of $120. 
* Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $120. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer, but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $85?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $60.
* **Still above my minimum:** $85 is still above my $120 minimum, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Appeal to Bob's value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob by reminding him that $85 is still a great deal for him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to make a final decision."
