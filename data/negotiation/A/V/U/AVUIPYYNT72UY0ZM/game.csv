"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while also giving you a significant return on your investment. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the value I know it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",815000.0,Alice,5,
