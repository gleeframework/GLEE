Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a high offer of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he doesn't accept the $20,000, it makes any subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. This means any offer Bob accepts above $15,000 is a profit. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. It's expected that Bob might counter, and Alice can then negotiate down towards a price that is still beneficial for her, ideally above that $15,000 mark."
