Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's closer to my desired outcome."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target of $9,500. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit. Hopefully, this will be appealing enough to Bob while still allowing me some room to negotiate further."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a better price.  John is a guaranteed $8,000, but I'm holding out hope for a bit more.  I'll counter with a price closer to $8,500 to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}

I'm lowering my price again, but staying above Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to secure a good price."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good price. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a significant profit over my minimum and only $100 less than my last offer. I'm willing to accept this to close the deal and avoid risking further negotiation."
