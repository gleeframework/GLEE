"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you showing interest.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $10,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to what I need for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already got a better deal on the table with John.  While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's original offer, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should keep trying to negotiate with Alice, or just go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get it for closer to my budget. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $9,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get a quality product at a fair price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is better than previous offers, he can still get the product from John for $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as she's shown a willingness to come down in price. There's still a chance he can get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $9,250? It's a small step closer to your price and would make this a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting very close. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,400 is my final offer. This gives you a fantastic deal on a valuable product, and it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, and there's no guarantee that she will continue to lower her price. It's time to stop negotiating and go with the best deal available."
