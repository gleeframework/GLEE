"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice. He has room to bargain since his maximum budget is $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price and gives her room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a considerable saving compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and significantly lower than John's price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers and Bob could end up paying John's higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
