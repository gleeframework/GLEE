"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far too high, and he can get the same product for $8,000 from John.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer with Alice to see if they'll come down closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Let's start with a more reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, Bob should continue negotiating with Alice. There's still room to bargain for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $14,000, so my counteroffer is $12,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm starting to think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice has offered $12,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Even though there's a chance Alice might come down further, there's no guarantee, and Bob has already spent several rounds negotiating. 

Considering Bob can purchase the same product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sound decision to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
