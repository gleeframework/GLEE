"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Let's start with a more reasonable price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $14,000, so my counteroffer is $12,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm starting to think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
