"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $725,000. I think this is the lowest price I can accept while still making a reasonable profit. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
