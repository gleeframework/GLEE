"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price through counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to compromise too much on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and the value you've acknowledged it has for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer, I can still try to negotiate further and see if she'll come down to my desired price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to drop the price by too much more. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is still unwilling to budge below $1,050,000. At this point, it's clear that further negotiation won't get me closer to my desired price. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving me $50,000. While I'm slightly disappointed that I didn't get a better deal from Alice, it's important to be pragmatic and secure the best possible outcome within my budget and limited rounds."
