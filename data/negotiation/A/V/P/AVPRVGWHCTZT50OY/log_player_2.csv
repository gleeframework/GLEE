"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You need to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in the product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1100000. This is a fair price that still allows for a significant profit while being reasonable for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. You can try to negotiate further.  You can try to get closer to your $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  Given the potential for this product, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to a deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll counteroffer at $1050000. This is a fair price that still allows for a significant profit while being reasonable for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still too high. You can try to get closer to your $800,000 limit. It's a risk, but if you can get to a lower price in the next couple of rounds, you can potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Given the time spent negotiating, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a good faith gesture, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1050000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,050,000.  You have only three rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to convince Alice to come down to your target price.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer."
