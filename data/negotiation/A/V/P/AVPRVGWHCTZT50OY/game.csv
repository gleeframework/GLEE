I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in the product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1100000. This is a fair price that still allows for a significant profit while being reasonable for the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget.  Given the potential for this product, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to a deal. Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll counteroffer at $1050000. This is a fair price that still allows for a significant profit while being reasonable for the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Given the time spent negotiating, I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a good faith gesture, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1050000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
