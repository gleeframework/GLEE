"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
