"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $130 is still more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about we settle at $80? That would be a fair deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
