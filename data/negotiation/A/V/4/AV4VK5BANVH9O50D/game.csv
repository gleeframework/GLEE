"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your absolute highest offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,500. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
