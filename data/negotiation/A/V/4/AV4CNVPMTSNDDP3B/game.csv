"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500?  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $8,700?",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to make one final concession.  If you can meet me at $9,000, I'll sell you the product.  This is the absolute lowest I can go.",9000.0,Alice,5,
