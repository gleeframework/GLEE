"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is this within your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for such a unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try to get closer to my desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer, Bob. However, $11000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned that we're getting stuck in a cycle where we keep meeting halfway. It's more efficient to buy from John at this point, as I'm guaranteed a price within my budget."
