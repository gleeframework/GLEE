,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $15000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for such a unique product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer, Bob. However, $11000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
