"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. It's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that works for both of us in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get a fair price for the product."
