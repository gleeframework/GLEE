Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're already making a profit of $20.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob still has room to negotiate down to a price that is still beneficial for him.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows confidence and sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $80.  While you could try to negotiate further, accepting his offer guarantees you a profit of $10 and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially ending with a lower price or a sale to John for $80."
