"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $700000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $775000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $750000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000.

This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,5,
