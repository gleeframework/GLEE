Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested.  
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly.

By starting at $140, we create a good balance between enticing Bob and ensuring we still make a significant profit even if we need to drop the price slightly during negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, we're still guaranteed our minimum acceptable price from John."
