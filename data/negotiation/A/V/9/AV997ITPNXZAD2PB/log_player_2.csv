"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $750000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item worth $800000 at a competitive price. I look forward to your consideration.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering a good price, but there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to get an even better deal.  He has nothing to lose since he can always default to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. While I recognize its worth, $750,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $700,000. This price reflects my genuine interest in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. I believe it's a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $725000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable compromise. I hope this proposal will be more in line with your budget and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial price and a good compromise.  This is closer to Bob's target price while still exceeding the value to Alice. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $75,000 compared to buying from John, making it the best choice in this scenario."
