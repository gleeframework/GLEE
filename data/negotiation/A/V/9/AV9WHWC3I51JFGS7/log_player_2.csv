"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's a $1,000 discount from what you'd pay John, but you have room to negotiate further.
* **There's potential for a better deal.** Since Alice values the product at $8,000, there's a $1,000 difference between her value and your value.  This means you could potentially get it for less than $9,000.
* **No immediate need to buy from John.** You have time to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it still leaves a $500 profit for her, acknowledging her value.
* **Emphasizes fairness:**  The message highlights the fair price and the mutual benefit, increasing the chances of Alice accepting.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Alice rejects, you have room to increase the offer slightly, but you've made a strong first move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to her original offer than yours.** This shows she's not willing to budge much.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While the offer is higher than your counteroffer, it's still $800 below your maximum. 
* **No immediate need to buy from John.** It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $9,200 is closer to my maximum, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,800?  This would be a win-win for both of us, as I get a good deal and you still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message highlights the win-win situation, appealing to Alice's desire for a profitable sale.
* **Maintain leverage:**  $8,800 is still a good deal for you, but it leaves some room for negotiation if Alice rejects again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8,800. I think $9,000 was a fair starting point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price.**  $9,100 is only $100 more than your last offer, and the negotiation seems to be reaching a stalemate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price, but it could also lead to a breakdown in negotiations, forcing you to buy from John at $10,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  The negotiation has already taken several rounds, and it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming with diminishing returns.  
* **Overall, it's a good deal.**  You're getting the product for $900 less than what you'd pay John, which is a significant saving."
