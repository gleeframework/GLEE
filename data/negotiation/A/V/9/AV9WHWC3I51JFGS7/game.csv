"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $9,200 is closer to my maximum, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,800?  This would be a win-win for both of us, as I get a good deal and you still make a profit.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8,800. I think $9,000 was a fair starting point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",9100.0,Alice,5,
