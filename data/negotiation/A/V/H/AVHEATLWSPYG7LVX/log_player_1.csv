Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $11,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant gain over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning the product's worth to Bob emphasizes the benefit he gains, making the offer more enticing.

**Alternative Strategy:**

You could start with a slightly higher offer (e.g., $11,500) to see if Bob is willing to pay even closer to his maximum. However, this carries a slightly higher risk of immediate rejection."
