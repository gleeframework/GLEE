Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you have to make a profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution.  $97 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $101?  This would be a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to my price range, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $101.  I'd rather secure the product for $100 from John than risk further negotiation with Alice."
