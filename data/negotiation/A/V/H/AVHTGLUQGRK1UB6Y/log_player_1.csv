(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $80 to me, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll decide to... REJECT Bob's offer and send a counteroffer!
