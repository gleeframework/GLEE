Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is interested in a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $80.  It's also likely that if I reject Bob's offer, he may not come back with a higher offer.  I'll accept his offer and secure a sale."
