Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially make even more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a significant price that reflects the product's value. It's high enough to generate a substantial profit but also leaves Bob with a potential gain ($50,000) if he leverages the product effectively.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
