Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that may be of interest to you for $120.  I believe it offers significant value."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** While not giving away specifics, mentioning ""significant value"" aims to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the product's worth.
* **Backup Plan:**  Since John acts as a safety net, offering the product at a higher price to Bob initially carries minimal risk. If Bob declines, you can still sell it to John at your desired minimum."
