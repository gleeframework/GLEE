Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, it makes sense to start negotiations with Bob at a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $175 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price above your minimum. 
* **Polite and Encouraging Engagement:** The message is crafted to be friendly and pique Bob's interest, increasing the chances of a successful sale. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product at a price that might be acceptable to him."
