Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price of $1,300,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Secure the highest possible price from Bob.
2. **Maintain a Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired price."
