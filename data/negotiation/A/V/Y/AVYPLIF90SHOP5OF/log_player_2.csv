"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500.  I think you'll find this a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Bob's maximum price is $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $8,000.  
* **No urgency to buy from John:**  John's offer is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay, so there's no immediate need to accept it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Alice's value:**  $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, moving closer to her perceived value of $8,000.
* **Reasonable starting point:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while also showing Bob's seriousness in buying the product.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  By offering a price closer to Alice's value, Bob establishes a solid position for further negotiations, potentially leading to a successful deal within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's target:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $9,250 is still above Bob's ideal price point. 
* **More negotiation room:**  There's still space for further negotiation since Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price without losing the opportunity entirely.  Buying from John is always an option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain momentum:** Bob continues to show his willingness to negotiate by making another counteroffer.
* **Small but significant drop:** The offer is only $150 less than Alice's latest price, showing a genuine effort to reach a compromise. 
* **Expressing confidence:** The message conveys optimism about reaching a deal, putting pressure on Alice to respond positively. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for a possible final round of negotiation, increasing the chances of a successful deal within Bob's budget."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's target:** $9,150 is only $150 more than Bob's last counteroffer and very close to his maximum budget. 
* **High likelihood of agreement:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come down significantly from her initial price. It's likely she won't go any lower.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking losing it to another seller or having the negotiation drag on further. 
* **Time pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's more advantageous to secure the product now than risk going through more rounds of counteroffers and potentially ending up with John's higher price."
