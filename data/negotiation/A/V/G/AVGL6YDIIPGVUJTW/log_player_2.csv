"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us room to negotiate up. 
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a good tone encourages further discussion.
* **Expressing Interest:** Showing we're serious about the product might make Alice more willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $14,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $14,000 is still more than you want to pay and more than John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moving towards your price indicates willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Deadline Approaching:** While we have rounds to go, it's good to keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. To be honest, $14,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nudging Closer:** We're getting closer to both our budget and a potential agreement point. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating  ""$11,000 is the highest I can go,"" we signal seriousness without being overly aggressive.
* **Time Consideration:**  With each round, the value of John's guaranteed offer becomes more relevant."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a tough ask for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you a price of $13,500. It's still a discount from my original price, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Improvement:** The price reduction from Alice is small, and we're running out of rounds to negotiate a significantly better deal.
* **John's Offer Looms:** We're now only $1,500 away from John's guaranteed price. The risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is increasing. 
* **Potential Walk Away:**  By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about our budget and might walk away. This could lead to a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but only if you can match that price."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** By revealing John's offer, we create a sense of urgency and give Alice a concrete reason to lower her price.
* **Final Offer:** We're stating our absolute maximum price, signaling that we're ready to walk away if it's not met. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  We're still expressing a preference for working with Alice, leaving the door open for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to match that price. I've already discounted the product significantly, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margins further. I'll offer you a price of $13,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unwilling to budge below $13,000, and we've made it clear that $12,000 is our limit. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significant price drop.
* **Guaranteed Savings:**  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000 saving compared to Alice's current price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and losing John's offer is too high.

It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at the best possible price."
