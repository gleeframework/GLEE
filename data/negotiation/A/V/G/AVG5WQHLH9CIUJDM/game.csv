"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1400000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
