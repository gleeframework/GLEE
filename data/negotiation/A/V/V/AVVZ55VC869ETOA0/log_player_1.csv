Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to my minimum of $100. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to create a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $85 is below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept an offer that doesn't meet my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $95. This is halfway between my minimum price of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. I'm still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm also showing a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.  The message is also positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up to $90, which is closer to my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John for $100. This is because the negotiation is getting more time-consuming and I'm not sure if Bob will go any higher.  Since John is already willing to pay my minimum, it's a safer bet to avoid further negotiations and secure a sale that meets my financial requirements."
