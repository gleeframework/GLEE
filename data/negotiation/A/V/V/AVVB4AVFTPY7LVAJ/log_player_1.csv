Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask, but still well above my minimum. I'll counter to see if I can meet in the middle.
