You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still do better. He has a safety net with John's offer of $8,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's offer but still above John's price. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants to save as much money as possible. He's hoping to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum limit of $8,000. While negotiating further might be possible, it's a risk, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing time or the product altogether.  By purchasing from John, Bob secures the product at his desired price."
