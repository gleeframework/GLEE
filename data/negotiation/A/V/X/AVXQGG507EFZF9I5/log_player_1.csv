"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in the next round.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000 if I don't feel like I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, and hopefully it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  If he rejects again, I'll have to think more seriously about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is a good strategy.  It's above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price.  I also want to avoid the chance of Bob getting frustrated and walking away, or me running out of rounds."
