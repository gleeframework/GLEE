Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $100, I've been negotiating for a while, and it seems unlikely Bob will go higher.  Accepting $96 is a better deal than selling to John for $120."
