Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While we want to maximize profit, pricing it too high ($119) ensures you're still getting a great price even if Bob rejects the offer.  
* **Creating Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving the door open for potential counter-offers."
