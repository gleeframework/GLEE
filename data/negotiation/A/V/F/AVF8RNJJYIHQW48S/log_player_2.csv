"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my $120 limit.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $85, I'm aiming for a price slightly above Alice's value ($80). This increases the chances of her accepting, as she'll still make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  This gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $92.50 is still above my target. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to counteroffer again to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate. $90 is a midpoint between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to nudge Alice towards accepting without appearing overly aggressive in my bargaining.
* **Alternative Reminder:**  While I don't explicitly mention John,  Alice is likely aware I have other buying options if we can't agree on a suitable price."
