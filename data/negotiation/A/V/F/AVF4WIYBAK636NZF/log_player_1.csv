Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value to someone with your interests, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You're aware that the product holds a value of $1,500,000 for Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,300,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($700,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential gain ($200,000). 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" and time-sensitive adds a layer of pressure that might encourage Bob to accept quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($800,000) if Bob rejects your proposal, ensuring you don't lose out completely."
