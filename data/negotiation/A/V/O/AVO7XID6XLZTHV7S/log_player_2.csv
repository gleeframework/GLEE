"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, he can start the negotiation and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While $8,250 is closer to his target, he can get the product for $8,000 from John. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying more."
