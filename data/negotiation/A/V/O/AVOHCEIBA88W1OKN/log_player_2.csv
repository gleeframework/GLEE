"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $90.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $90.  Since Bob wants to save as much money as possible, he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he's starting with a lower counteroffer. He's aiming to be aggressive but not unreasonable, hoping to find a middle ground with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal and should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $80? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice his maximum price, which is the same as what he would pay John. This is a strong counteroffer, showing Alice that he's serious about getting the product but won't pay more than what it's worth to him."
