"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's potential.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, to be realistic, that's still quite a ways off what I have in mind. I could consider $9,500, but that's really stretching my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $14,250? That's a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to make this deal happen.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, that price is still a bit too high for me.  I can offer $11,000. This is a fair offer, considering John is offering me the same product for $10,000.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but comparing my product solely to John's offer doesn't reflect the additional value and benefits mine provides. To move this forward, I can come down to $13,000.  This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,7,
