Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, that price is still a bit too high for me.  I can offer $11,000. This is a fair offer, considering John is offering me the same product for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's knowledge:** Bob revealing that John is offering the product for $10,000 is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure me. It's crucial not to let this information sway my position too drastically.
* **Potential profit:** While $11,000 is a significant increase from Bob's previous offers, it's still considerably less than my minimum and what I could get from John.
* **Negotiation leverage:** I still have rounds to negotiate and can use Bob's offer as leverage to push for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but comparing my product solely to John's offer doesn't reflect the additional value and benefits mine provides. To move this forward, I can come down to $13,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's point about John's offer but re-emphasizing the unique value of my product. 
* **Final offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm not willing to go much lower. 
* **Strategic positioning:** $13,000 is a strong yet reasonable compromise. It allows me to potentially secure a deal with Bob while still maintaining a significant profit margin.  
* **Walk-away preparedness:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm mentally prepared to walk away and accept John's $15,000 offer."
