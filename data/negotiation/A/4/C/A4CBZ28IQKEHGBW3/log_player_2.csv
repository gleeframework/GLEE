"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and counter with a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I understand that it's above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  I'll counter with a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at a significantly lower price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

While $975,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. At this point, it's more beneficial to me to buy the product from John for $800,000. This will save me a significant amount of money and ensures I get the product within my budget."
