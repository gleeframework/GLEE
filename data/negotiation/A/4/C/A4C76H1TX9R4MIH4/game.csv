"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000, which is the price I was initially offered by John. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
