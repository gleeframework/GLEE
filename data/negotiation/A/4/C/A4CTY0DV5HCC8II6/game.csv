"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to propose $975,000 as a compromise. This still saves you some money compared to your original asking price, while also being closer to what you're comfortable with. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's try $1,000,000. This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your suggestion, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $985,000. This proposal aims to be fair for both parties involved and brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",985000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $985,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $995,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and hopefully bring us to a final agreement.",995000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your latest offer, Alice. I am willing to consider $990,000 as a final counteroffer. This proposal aims to be fair to both of us and allows us to close the gap. I hope this meets your expectations.",990000.0,Bob,8,
