Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so a $1 million offer gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're not willing to go below $1,200,000, but this offer leaves you room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **It's clear and concise:** A simple message and a clear price make it easy for Bob to understand the offer. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can potentially secure a higher final price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum. You can likely get closer to your desired price by countering Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 or $1,100,000. 
* Be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects your counteroffer. 
* Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, but it's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob before taking that route."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. It shows you're willing to compromise while still trying to get closer to your desired price.
* **Remaining above your minimum:**  $1,025,000 is still above your minimum price of $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Positive and constructive:** The message is positive and focuses on reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By offering a price closer to your desired price while still showing flexibility, you increase the chances of reaching a deal with Bob and maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to propose $975,000 as a compromise. This still saves you some money compared to your original asking price, while also being closer to what you're comfortable with. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum and you're confident you can get closer to your goal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  Send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  You can use a similar strategy to before, offering to split the difference between your previous offer and Bob's current offer.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's try $1,000,000. This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying consistent:** You've already stated your willingness to go down to $1,000,000 before, so this counteroffer shows consistency and reinforces your stance. 
* **Meeting halfway:** You're again offering to split the difference between your previous offer of $1,025,000 and Bob's offer of $975,000. This shows you're serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Staying above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still above your minimum price of $1,200,000, leaving you some wiggle room if needed.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while giving you a chance to get the best possible price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your suggestion, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $985,000. This proposal aims to be fair for both parties involved and brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $985,000 is very close to your minimum desired price, you're still in a strong negotiating position. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price of $1,200,000.  It's worth seeing if you can get Bob to budge a little more before accepting his offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You can send a counteroffer to Bob, suggesting a price closer to $1,000,000. This might be your final attempt to get a price closer to your desired range before resorting to selling to John.

* **Prepare for the final decision:** Be ready to make a decision based on Bob's response to your counteroffer. If you feel he won't budge, it might be time to sell to John and secure the guaranteed higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $985,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $995,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and hopefully bring us to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is likely your final counteroffer before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Meeting halfway:** You're offering to split the difference between your previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $985,000. This shows continued flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Close to your minimum:**  $995,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Clear Signal:** This counteroffer sends a clear signal that you're serious about getting a price as close as possible to your desired range. 

This counteroffer offers Bob a chance to close the deal while still allowing you to get a decent price for your product. If Bob rejects this offer, you're ready to move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your latest offer, Alice. I am willing to consider $990,000 as a final counteroffer. This proposal aims to be fair to both of us and allows us to close the gap. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $990,000 is a very tempting offer and is closer to your minimum than before, you're ultimately in a better position. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,200,000.  It's not worth risking losing out on that guaranteed profit for a slight increase in price. 

**Next Steps:**

You can politely thank Bob for his offer but let him know you've decided to sell the product to another buyer. It's important to maintain a professional relationship, even if you're not concluding a deal with him."
