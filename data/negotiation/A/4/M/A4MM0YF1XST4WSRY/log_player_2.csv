"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to our goal, and we're already approaching the midpoint of our negotiations.  While it's tempting to keep pushing for a lower price, accepting this offer ensures we get a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation falling through. It's better to secure this price than to potentially end up with the higher price from John."
