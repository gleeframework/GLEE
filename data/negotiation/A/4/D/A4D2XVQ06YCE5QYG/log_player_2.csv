"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than both your maximum price and Alice's perceived value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $85."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest while being clear about budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $100 is still too high. We're aiming for closer to $90.  We'll continue negotiating and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $90? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:**  We're inching closer to a potential agreement. $90 is a compromise between our initial offer and Alice's current price.
* **Expressing Fairness:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we're emphasizing a win-win scenario. 
* **Maintaining Decisiveness:** We're still aiming for a good deal and not conceding too much too quickly."
