"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $800000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below what I can accept at this time.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
