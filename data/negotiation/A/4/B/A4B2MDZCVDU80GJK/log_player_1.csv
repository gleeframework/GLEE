Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I think you'll find it quite valuable. I'm asking for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price gives Alice room to negotiate down if Bob counters. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at $100.
* **Setting a High Anchor:**  By starting at $150, Alice sets a high anchor in Bob's mind. This might make a counter-offer closer to $100 feel like a better deal to Bob than if Alice had started lower. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with some level of negotiation. If she wants a quick and guaranteed sale, she could offer the product to Bob at $100."
