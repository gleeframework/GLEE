"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is close to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is worth less to her. By rejecting her initial offer and proposing a counteroffer, I might be able to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A large difference will reveal how willing she is to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  Even if she rejects this offer, it sets the stage for a middle ground closer to my desired price range. 
* **Avoid appearing too eager:**  A more aggressive counteroffer suggests I'm serious about getting a good deal and not easily swayed by the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my desired range, but there's still room for improvement. A $12,500 price tag means I'd save $2,500 compared to John's offer, but I think I can get closer to a $3,000 or even $4,000 saving with further negotiation.  It's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Showing willingness to compromise:**  I've moved closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating I'm serious about buying and willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic middle ground:**  $11,750 is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between her last offer ($12,500) and mine ($11,000).
* **Maintaining pressure:**  While compromising, I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to my ideal range."
