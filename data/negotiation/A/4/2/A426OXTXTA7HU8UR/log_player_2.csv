"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is also eager to purchase it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer and buying from John achieves your goal of getting the product while saving money (potentially). You could try to negotiate a lower price with John, but the prompt doesn't allow for that."
