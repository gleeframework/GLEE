``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm trying to get a price closer to my value of $12,000, while still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we go with $9,250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target of $12,000. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $9,400.  This is a good price for both of us, and it's closer to my desired price while still being within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,200? I think that's the best compromise we can reach. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I've made several counteroffers, but it seems we can't reach an agreement. To ensure I get a fair price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
