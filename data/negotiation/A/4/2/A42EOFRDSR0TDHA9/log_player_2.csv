Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $72. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $75. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price for you while avoiding the risk of the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John for $100."
