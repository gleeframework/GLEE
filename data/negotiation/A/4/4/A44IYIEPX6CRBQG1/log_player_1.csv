"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum of $80.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay a premium!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is a fair compromise -  it's still above my minimum, and it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial price. Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm feeling confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to counter with $82.  This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, it's enough to convince Bob to close the deal!"

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but we are running out of rounds. I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $80. It's not the ideal price, but it's better than risking getting a lower price in the remaining rounds."
