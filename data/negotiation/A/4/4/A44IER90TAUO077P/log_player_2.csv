"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $105. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's below what I could get elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is above your maximum budget of $100. You know you can get the product for $100 from John. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
