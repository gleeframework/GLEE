"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be a good starting point. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the true market value and the substantial returns you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
