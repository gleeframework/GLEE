"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly sought after. 
* **Justification:** I've provided a vague but positive justification for the high price, emphasizing ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" without revealing specific details.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers my minimum, I'm not settling for that yet. There's potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value.  This indicates he has room to move, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price this early in the negotiation. By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about a higher valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the true market value and the substantial returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Large but Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, I'm still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value and potential, aiming to steer Bob's focus towards the long-term benefits rather than just the upfront cost.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm not dropping below $2,000,000 yet. I want to see how Bob responds and if he's willing to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the potential loss of selling to John at my minimum."
