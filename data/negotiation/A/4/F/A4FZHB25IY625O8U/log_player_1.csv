Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I can still try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8700? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I have more rounds left and want to see if I can get closer to my goal.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,700 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,850. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 8850}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,600 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,700? This is my final offer before I consider other options.  I think it's a fair price, and I hope we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8700}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8700. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8500. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob and I are not likely to agree on a price.  I've tried to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,700, and Bob seems firm at $8,500. With only two rounds left, I'm better off selling to John for $10,000. It's the best outcome for me in this situation."
