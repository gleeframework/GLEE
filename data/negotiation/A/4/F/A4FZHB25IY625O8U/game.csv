"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Could you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9000.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8700? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means.",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8700 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8850. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to reach an agreement on this offer.",8850.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8600 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference at $8700? This is my final offer before I consider other options.  I think it's a fair price, and I hope we can close this deal.",8700.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8700. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8500. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,8,
