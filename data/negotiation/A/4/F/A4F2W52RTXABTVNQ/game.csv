"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $8,500, which would be $8,875. Can you consider this price?",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,875 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is my final offer, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,7,
