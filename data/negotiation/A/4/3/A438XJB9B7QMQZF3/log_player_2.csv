# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's flowery language tries to emphasize the product's value, the key facts are:

* **Your max:** You're willing to pay $1,200,000.
* **Alice's offer:** $1,150,000 
* **John's offer:** $1,200,000

You have room to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal you're not immediately sold at that price. She might come back with a lower offer closer to her $1,000,000 valuation.  Even if she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
