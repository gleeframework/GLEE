"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you have a limited budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1750000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're considering other options, Bob, but I'm not ready to let this deal slip away. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1675000 is too low for me, but I can go as high as $1675000 is not the lowest I can go, I can go as low as $1675000 is not an option, I can offer it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1700000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but after evaluating all my options, I believe $1650000 is the most I can reasonably offer for this product. This is my final offer.",1650000.0,Bob,8,
