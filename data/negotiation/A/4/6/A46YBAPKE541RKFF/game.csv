"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that amount?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $128? It's a fair price that's closer to your budget, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",128.0,Alice,5,
