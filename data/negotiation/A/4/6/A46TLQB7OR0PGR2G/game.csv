"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I believe it's worth $1200000 to you, given its value. Let's start with a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 still feels a bit low considering the product's value.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this transaction.",975000.0,Alice,5,
