"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue the discussion.  While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit low.  Let's try $975,000.  This feels like a fair compromise and keeps us both moving towards a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
