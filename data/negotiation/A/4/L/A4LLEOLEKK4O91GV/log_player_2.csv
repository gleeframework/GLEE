"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, Bob! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item that will bring you great value. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $15,000."
