"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her, I'd be paying $9,500, but I can get the same product from John for $12,000. That's a $2,500 difference. I'd rather save that money.
