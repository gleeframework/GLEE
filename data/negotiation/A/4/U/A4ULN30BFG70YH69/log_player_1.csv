"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to your portfolio.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a starting price of $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate downward and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Anchoring:**  By opening with a $2,000,000 offer, we ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even though Bob's valuation is lower, this high starting point might influence his counteroffer to be more favorable to us. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We've left a significant margin between our asking price and both our minimum ($1,500,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000). This signals that we're open to negotiation but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Gradual Concession:**  While we want to maximize profit, abruptly accepting John's offer might make Bob disengage completely. By rejecting and countering, we show willingness to negotiate but maintain our position. 
* **Time on Our Side:** We have plenty of rounds left to explore a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from $2,000,000 to $1,900,000, signaling our willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We're still significantly above both Bob's valuation and John's offer. This keeps the pressure on Bob to justify his lower valuation while reminding him of the potential cost of walking away.
* **Encouraging Movement:** By making a $100,000 concession, we hope to encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating progress and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above John's Offer:** At $1,750,000, Bob's offer is still more profitable than immediately selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We are in Round 4, and we believe that we can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  Our concessions are encouraging him to move closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal.  How about we meet halfway at $1,825,000?"",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By proposing $1,825,000 (exactly halfway between the previous offers), we signal a desire for a fair and swift resolution. This approach often resonates well in negotiations.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We want to keep the negotiation moving and avoid a stalemate. This offer encourages Bob to respond constructively.
* **Still Profitable:**  This price point remains significantly above our minimum and John's standing offer, preserving a healthy profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. I think we can find a better solution. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** $1,775,000 is a substantial profit, significantly exceeding both our minimum price and John's offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After six rounds, negotiations can stall.  Accepting now capitalizes on a good offer and avoids the risk of Bob reducing his offer or disengaging.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to re-invest the capital sooner, potentially generating additional returns.  

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a small incremental gain. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,775,000 represents a successful negotiation outcome."
