Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  While the product is worth $15,000 to me, it's only worth $10,000 to Bob. This price gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's losing out completely.
* **It's still profitable:** I'm making a profit of $4,000, which is a decent return for a product I value highly.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can lower my price a bit to reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not giving away the farm. 

This strategy balances the desire to maximize my profit with the possibility of a deal falling through.  I'm confident that I can get a good price for the product, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. This will give me a chance to see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering Bob with $13,000. Here's why:

* **Compromise:** This is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Still profitable:** I'm still making a profit of $1,000, which is better than accepting his initial offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I might be willing to go down slightly further, but I'm unlikely to go below $12,500.

This counteroffer gives me the best chance of reaching a deal without significantly jeopardizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make the deal worthwhile for me.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $15,000.  This ensures that I get the best possible price and avoids further negotiation with Bob that might lead to an even lower price."
