"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and the price John offers ($800,000). By rejecting her offer, you can pursue the guaranteed option of buying from John at a lower price."
