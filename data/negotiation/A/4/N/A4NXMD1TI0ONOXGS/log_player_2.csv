"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is within my budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. There's a chance I can get a better deal by negotiating. I want to see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and sets a clear starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from her original price, and $11,000 is a good deal for me. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll reject my next counteroffer, and I could end up paying the full $12,000 to John. It's better to secure this price and save $1,000."
