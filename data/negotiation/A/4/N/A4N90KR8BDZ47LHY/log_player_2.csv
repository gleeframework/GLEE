Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $10,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $9,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $8,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
