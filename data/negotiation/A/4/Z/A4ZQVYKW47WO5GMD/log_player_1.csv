"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to manage your budget, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I could meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $8,800. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:

```
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go any higher and we are nearing John's offer. Taking the $8,800 is the best move to maximize profit.
