"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to own something truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. We'll reject Alice's initial offer and see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're still trying to get the best price. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair price considering my initial offer and your last one.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000 as a final compromise. This price reflects a fair value for the product and allows for a smooth transaction.  I'm hoping we can close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've been negotiating for a while, and while $1,025,000 is closer to our goal, it's still a bit higher than we'd like to pay. It's probably a better strategy at this point to just buy from John and get the product for $1,000,000."
