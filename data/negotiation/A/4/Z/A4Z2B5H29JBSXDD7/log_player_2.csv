"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000, Alice's offer is already below your maximum.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget.  We'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is closer to my ideal price.  Since I have 7 rounds left, I'm willing to accept this offer and save $800 compared to buying from John. There's a risk that I could get an even better price with more negotiation, but I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to buy at a higher price."
