"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and it allows you to acquire a valuable asset for a price that is still below its worth to you.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can leverage the offer from John and potentially negotiate an even better deal with Alice or secure the product for $800,000 from John."
