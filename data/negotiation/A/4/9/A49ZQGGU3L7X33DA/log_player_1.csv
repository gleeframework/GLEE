I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly more than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a little more to secure it.  

I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $10,000. This gives me a safety net and allows me to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
