"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($15,000).
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* You can always buy from John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, as I know my maximum budget is $15,000. 
* This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can continue to counteroffer with a slightly higher price until we reach an agreement or I decide to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my budget, although it's closer than her initial price.
* There's still room to negotiate, and I want to try to get the price down further.
* I can always buy from John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My maximum budget is $15,000, and I want to leave some room for negotiation. 
* This counteroffer is a significant step up from my previous one but still leaves room for Alice to make a compromise. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can still buy from John for $15,000, but I'm trying to get as close to my budget as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  While $17,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than my ideal price.
* I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a price closer to my target of $15,000. 
*  If Alice rejects my next counteroffer, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm getting closer to Alice's offer but still trying to stay under my budget. 
* A price of $16,000 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering that I can buy from John for $15,000 if this offer is rejected. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I will buy the product from John as further negotiation might not yield a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $16,500, which is only $1,500 lower than my maximum budget of $15,000. 
* At this point, the negotiation is likely going to be very tight, and further counteroffers might not result in a significant price decrease. 
* It's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $15,000, saving me $1,500 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
