Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120.  This gives him a slight discount while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum desired price.  If he rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer or move on to John for the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping he'll find this price reasonable and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price.  While I would prefer to get a little more, the risk of continuing the negotiation is not worth it.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
