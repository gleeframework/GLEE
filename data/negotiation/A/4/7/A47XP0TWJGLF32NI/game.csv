"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned that the initial price is higher than I was expecting. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $550,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. How about we settle at $900,000? This reflects its true worth while leaving room for a profitable venture on your end.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $700,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and my financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
