Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value. While I could accept and secure a sale, I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering $1,350,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate but still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and I'd rather secure a sale than continue negotiating with Bob."
