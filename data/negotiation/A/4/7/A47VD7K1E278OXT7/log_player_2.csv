# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This offer includes all the features you're looking for and more. Let me know if this aligns with your budget and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can do better than $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of that, I am proposing a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our respective positions while still allowing us to maintain a fair valuation for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to your target of $8,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely. It's a good compromise to accept her offer."
