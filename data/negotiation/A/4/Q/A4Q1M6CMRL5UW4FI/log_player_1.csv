Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you're interested in, for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as a Back-up:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 gives us leverage. We don't *need* to go below that.

By offering the product at $14,000, we give Bob a perceived ""deal"" while still securing a substantial profit for ourselves."
