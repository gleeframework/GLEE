"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",125.0,Alice,3,
