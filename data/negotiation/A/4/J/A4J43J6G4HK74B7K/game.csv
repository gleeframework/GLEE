"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to be happy. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise to get the product, but I need to stay within my limits.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, though.  How about $1,275,000? It's a fair price that allows me to get a reasonable return on my product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,275,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $1,230,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my limits.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
