"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $180 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's split the difference.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still too low. Let's try $105. I think this is a fair price for a product we both find valuable.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $98. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to go with John's offer.",98.0,Bob,6,
