This offer sets a price point that is significantly higher than your minimum threshold of $15,000. This gives you some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still presenting a profitable deal for yourself."

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than $18,000."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum threshold and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price.  It's a decent deal and I'm ready to sell to Bob."
