"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get it lower before settling."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?

Alice's new offer of $925,000 is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round of counteroffers to see if I can get it lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $920,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $900,000, and it's still significantly lower than the $1,200,000 I would pay John.  This is a good deal for me, and I'd rather secure the product at this price than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out entirely."
