"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $925,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's aim for a final agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
