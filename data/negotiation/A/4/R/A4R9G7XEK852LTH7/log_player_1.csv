I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and see if it's worth pursuing further or if I should just sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, but I still think I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,350,000.  It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's counteroffer, and it leaves some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above my minimum of $1,000,000 and selling to John would only net me that amount.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
