Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to the product's value to me ($15,000) but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Message:** The message is friendly but emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:**  $13,000 is a decent offer, but I can likely get closer to my desired price of $14,000.
* **Negotiating Power:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage.  I can use this information to push Bob a bit higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I'm willing to take a slight risk to try and maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find the product is well worth it."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000).  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the value of the product.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the compromise and the product's worth to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  By staying above $13,000, I'm still getting more than I would from John, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating with Bob."
