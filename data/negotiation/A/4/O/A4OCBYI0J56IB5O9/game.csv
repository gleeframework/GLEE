"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I'm confident this represents a fair starting point for discussion.  What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has some nice features, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product.  Could you do $11,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000 even? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks again for working with me.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $11,000 is still pushing it a bit. Could we try $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
