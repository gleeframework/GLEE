Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're guaranteed $10,000 from John, so anything above that is a win.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  He values the product at $15,000, so $14,000 is a good deal for him.  
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can always lower the price slightly to try and close the deal."
