"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I appreciate your interest in our product, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer. Our product has a significant value and we believe it deserves a price that reflects its quality and uniqueness. We would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This offers a compromise between our initial asking price and your maximum budget. We hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for considering my offer. $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of your last offer, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that takes into account both our interests and expectations. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can finalize the transaction.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $9,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be a happy customer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
