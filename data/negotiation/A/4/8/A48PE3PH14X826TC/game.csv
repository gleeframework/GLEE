"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $525,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.
