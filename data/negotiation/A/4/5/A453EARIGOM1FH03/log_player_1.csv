Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable offer:** It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** This makes Bob more likely to engage in a conversation. 
* **It sets a positive tone:** You highlight the value for Bob, making him feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Remember, this is just the beginning of the negotiation. Based on Bob's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. You're better off trying to negotiate with Bob further or selling to John, who is willing to pay your minimum price.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Here are a few things to consider:

* **Counteroffer amount:**  Aim for something closer to your desired price point. You could offer $9,000, for example.
* **Justification:**  Clearly explain why your counteroffer is fair. You could emphasize the value of the product or highlight the fact that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  If Bob isn't willing to meet you halfway, you're always free to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $9,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  $9,000 is a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing you are willing to compromise. 
* **Justification:**  You address Bob's budget concerns while also highlighting the value of the product to justify the higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  You use language like ""great deal"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! If not, you'll need to decide if you want to make another counteroffer or sell to John. 
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** Remember, you're not obligated to sell to Bob if you don't feel the price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to your minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below your ideal outcome. You're not desperate for a sale, and you have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay your full asking price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You can counter with $9,500.  This shows that you're willing to negotiate but still have a higher price in mind. You can explain that this is your final offer, as you have a backup buyer ready to purchase at a higher price. 
* **Be Firm:** If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, you should stick to your decision and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500, which is my final offer. This is a great price considering the product's value. I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price, so this is your last chance to secure this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  $9,500 is a slight compromise from your previous offer, showing flexibility while still upholding your minimum price.
* **Clear Communication:**  You explicitly state that this is your final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially motivating Bob to accept.
* **Backup Buyer:**  Mentioning a backup buyer adds pressure to the negotiation and emphasizes your commitment to achieving a fair price.
* **Positive Framing:**  You continue to highlight the value of the product and frame the deal as a ""great price"" for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, great! If not, be prepared to sell to John at $12,000.
* **Stick to Your Decision:**  It's important to remain firm in your decision to sell to John if Bob rejects your final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been firm on his price, and you've already made a final counteroffer.  At this point, there's little room for further negotiation, and you risk wasting time trying to get Bob to budge.  John is a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay your minimum price, ensuring you achieve your goal of earning at least $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

You should contact John and finalize the sale."
