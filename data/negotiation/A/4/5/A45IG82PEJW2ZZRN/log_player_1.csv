Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will give you an idea of his interest level and potential price sensitivity.  
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's limited risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Psychology:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the $120, it might make a slightly lower counter-offer from him (e.g., $100) seem more reasonable in comparison. 

**Important Note:** I'm assuming a one-shot offer where Bob can't counter-offer. If counter-offers were allowed, the strategy would need adjustments to involve more back-and-forth negotiation."
