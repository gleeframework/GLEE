"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this proposal works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get a higher price from John.  $12,000 is too low for me, especially since I'm aware of John's willingness to pay $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob further, but I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if I don't get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll receive. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to what I'm comfortable with. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this helps us move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm closer to his price, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth.  John is still a viable option, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there. $13,000 is a good offer, but I need to at least get $14,000 for this to work. I'm willing to meet you halfway and see if we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort in trying to meet my budget constraints. I am willing to increase my offer to $13,500. I believe this price is fair for both of us and I hope you consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I'm not feeling the pressure to settle yet, especially with John as a backup. I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I want to try to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,500 as a final concession. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering our previous negotiations and I'd like to propose a price of $14,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of time.  I'm happy to close the deal at $14,000 rather than risk losing the sale completely or having to settle for John's $15,000 offer."
