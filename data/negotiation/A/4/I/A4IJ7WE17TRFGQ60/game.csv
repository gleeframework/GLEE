"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's work together to find a compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
