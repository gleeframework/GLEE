"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested, I'm not sure $1000000 is quite right. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still trying to get to a price that works for both of us.  How about $950000?  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000. I'll counteroffer at $1000000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
