"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm confident it will bring significant value to your business. My asking price is $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  While the product may be valuable, it's not worth paying a premium. It's more strategic to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900000 is a fair price, it's just slightly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant concession on my part, but it's also a price that reflects the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above what you are willing to pay.  It's worth seeing if you can get her to lower the price even further.  You can still buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
