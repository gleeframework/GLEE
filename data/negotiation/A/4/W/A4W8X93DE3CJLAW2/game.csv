"Hey Alice, $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115?  It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $110? That's a good price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",110.0,Bob,4,
