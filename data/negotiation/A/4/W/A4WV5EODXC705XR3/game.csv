"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming to find a fair deal, $10,000 is still too low.  Could you do $12,000?  I think that's a very reasonable compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
