Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so don't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than it is to you.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure a deal with Bob before moving on to John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept while maximizing your profit.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation leaves room for you to profit substantially while ensuring Bob sees value in the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the substantial benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:** $1,150,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price and allows for a substantial profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making the price more palatable.
* **Open to Discussion:**  While a strong offer, the tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even higher final price. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is about finding a mutually agreeable price. Bob may counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if his counter-offer is acceptable or if you're willing to walk away and sell to John."
