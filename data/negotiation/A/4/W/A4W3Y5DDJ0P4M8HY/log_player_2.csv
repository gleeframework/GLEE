(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your desired price range. You want to see if you can get a better deal. By rejecting, you can start negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong negotiating tactic to demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a better price.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it establishes a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate. I want to try and get the price down even further before considering buying from Alice or John.  By rejecting the offer, I keep the negotiation going and can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I still believe there's room for compromise. This tactic can encourage Alice to be more flexible in her subsequent offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good price, considering my initial goal was to spend no more than $1,500,000. It's a significant savings compared to buying from John. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and losing out on this deal is too high."
