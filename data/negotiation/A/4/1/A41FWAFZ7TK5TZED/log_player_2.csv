"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to the product's value to Alice, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a great price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower, or Bob could choose to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't go his way."
