"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. How about $85?  I'm really hoping to make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $90. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make this deal happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we compromise at $92? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",92.0,Alice,5,
