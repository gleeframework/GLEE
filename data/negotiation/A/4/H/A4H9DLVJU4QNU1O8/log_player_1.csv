Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I go down to $8,500? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll go up to $7250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a better price. $7,250 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate to sell yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to $8,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further and meet you at $8,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
