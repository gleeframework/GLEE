Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $120. I believe it offers significant value at this price point."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible while ensuring I'm above my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below my minimum.
* **Strong Initial Offer:** A strong initial offer shows confidence in the product's value and might encourage Bob to accept without further negotiation. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (leading to a sale at $80) with the potential for a significantly higher profit if he accepts."
