Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a common tactic to maximize profits.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know I'm open to discussion and that I'm willing to work with him.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation process favorably while leaving room for adjustments based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value to me and the cost to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity to improve:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I might be able to get closer to that price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial proposal. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and that my offer is fair considering its worth.
* **Call to action:** I'm encouraging Bob to consider my offer and find common ground.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $1125000 for your product. This price still represents a significant saving for me compared to the product's value, while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,125,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited potential for improvement:**  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely that Bob will come close to my desired price.
* **Guarantee with John:** Selling to John ensures a certain and significantly higher profit.

**Conclusion:**  The risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential benefits.  Selling to John guarantees a higher profit and avoids further negotiation."
