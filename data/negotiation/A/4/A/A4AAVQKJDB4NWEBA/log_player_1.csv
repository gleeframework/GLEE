"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for some negotiation.  Let's see if he's willing to pay a good price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation.  Let's see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm to get a good price.  I believe $130 is a fair compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, I still think I can get a better price.  Let's see if we can close the deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm making one last compromise. $125 is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best option to close the deal. If Bob rejects this, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but we're running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's better to take the sure $100 from John than to gamble with Bob and end up with nothing."
