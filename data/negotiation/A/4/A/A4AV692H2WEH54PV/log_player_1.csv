Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
 
This starting offer:

* **Starts high:** It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a price closer to your true value. 
* **Doesn't scare Bob off:** While higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not so outrageous that it would make him immediately walk away.
* **Presents an opportunity for you to gauge Bob's interest:** His response will give you a better sense of how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Here's how to break down the decision:

* **Bob's offer ($90) is more than your minimum ($100).** This is a key point â€“ you're already in a position to profit.

* **Negotiating further has risks:** Bob might lower his offer, or the negotiation could drag on.

* **John guarantees $100:** This is your safety net and a known quantity.

**Decision:** While you could try to negotiate higher, the risk isn't worth it in this scenario.

**Explanation:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees you the best possible outcome in this situation. It's a small profit, but it's a sure thing."
