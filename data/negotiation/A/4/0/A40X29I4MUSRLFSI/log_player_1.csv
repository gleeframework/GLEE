Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 as that's my minimum value.
* **Bob's value:** I know Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer to see if I can maximize my profit.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers.
* **John as a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me a guaranteed $10,000, which protects me from losing out entirely if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is low:** While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price and below Bob's perceived value. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price of $11,500. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $10,000, I'm willing to take a slight risk of losing the deal with Bob to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $11,500 to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Still above minimum:** $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on value.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle, or if he will counteroffer again."
