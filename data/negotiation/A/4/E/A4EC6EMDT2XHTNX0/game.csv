"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200,  which is still a good deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? It's fair for both of us and we can finalize the sale. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
