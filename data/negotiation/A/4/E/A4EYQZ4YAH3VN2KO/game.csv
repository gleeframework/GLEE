"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000? I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.",750000.0,Alice,5,
