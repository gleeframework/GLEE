"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give up the product for a pittance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm countering with $160. This is a slight decrease from my last offer, showing I'm still willing to compromise, but it's still a reasonable price for me considering the value of the product. With only a few rounds left, I want to see if I can get Bob to budge closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Bob. I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping that I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm countering with $155. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price.  It's a last attempt to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will come up to my minimum price. I'm not willing to risk selling for even less than John's offer, so I'm going to sell to him and secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements."
