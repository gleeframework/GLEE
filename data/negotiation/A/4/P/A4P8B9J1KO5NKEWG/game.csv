"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its quality and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's quality and potential.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to the mark, I can't let this go for less than $15,000.  This is my bottom line, reflecting the true value of this product.  I believe you'll see a significant return on this investment.",15000.0,Alice,5,
