Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $180. This price is above my minimum of $150, giving me a profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $160. This is still above my minimum but is a compromise from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  Rather than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price, I'll sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I meet my minimum and avoid any further negotiation."
