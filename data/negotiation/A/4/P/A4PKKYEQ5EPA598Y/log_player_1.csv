Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you still get a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for him to counter and for you to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It's a strong initial offer:**  This price shows that you're serious about selling the product to Bob, but you're also not willing to give it away for cheap."

# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about $900,000?

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Bob's offer:

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially reach a price closer to your target."
