"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about we settle on $1,012,500?  This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product for you, while also allowing me to get a reasonable return. Let me know what you think.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
