"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aware that Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this is a substantial markup.  However, I'm confident that the value I place on the product, $1,500,000, justifies this starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still keeping my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still confident that I can get a better price than Bob's current offer. It's getting close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before I settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm lowering the price to my absolute minimum.  I'm confident that Bob is willing to pay this much, given his previous offers.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
