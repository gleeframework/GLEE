Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and I know I have John as a backup buyer at $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price might make Bob more receptive than a very high initial offer."
