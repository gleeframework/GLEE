"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,500.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
