"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10,500, but I'm still looking to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
