"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,000?  It's still a fantastic price for a product you value at $10,000, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,000? This gives you a great price for a valuable product, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,900, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for a product you value at $10,000.  Let's find a way to make this happen!",11250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go above $10,900. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, but I need you to meet me halfway. Can you consider that price?",10900.0,Bob,8,
