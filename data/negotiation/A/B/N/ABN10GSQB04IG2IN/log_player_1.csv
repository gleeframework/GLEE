Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. A price too close to $1,200,000 might discourage him, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it can significantly benefit you, and I'm confident it's worth far more than my asking price. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward and conveys the value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, a strong incentive to buy. It also gives you a significant profit of $150,000 over your fallback option.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is an art. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, in which case you'll need to decide your next move based on his proposal."
