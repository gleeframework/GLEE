"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is just too low for me.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a profit. ",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $125 is a bit too low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $140, which would be $132.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",132.5,Bob,4,
