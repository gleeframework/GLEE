Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $700,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to sell. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000. This is a fair price that allows you to get the product you want while still providing me with a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.
