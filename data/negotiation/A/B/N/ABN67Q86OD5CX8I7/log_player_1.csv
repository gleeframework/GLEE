Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is higher than Bob's $800,000 value, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, giving you a buffer.
* **It's open-ended:** The message invites Bob to discuss the offer, suggesting flexibility and potential for negotiation.

This strategy allows me to assess Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my desired price. If not, I can move to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than his own perceived value. Accepting it would be a big loss for me.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer that is more favorable, or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $700,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to sell. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  $850,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's proposal.
* **Maintain a reasonable profit:** It's still above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my desired price.
* **Encourage a deal:** The message is positive and suggests a willingness to find a solution.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $750,000.  Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss compared to what I could get from John. I will make another counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price.  If he rejects that, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000. This is a fair price that allows you to get the product you want while still providing me with a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  I've lowered my price significantly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlight mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes that this price is fair for both of us.
* **Create urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's close this deal"" suggests that this is my final offer. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to John and secure the $1,000,000 sale."
