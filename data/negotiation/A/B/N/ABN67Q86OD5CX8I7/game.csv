"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $700,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to sell. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $750,000.  Would you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000. This is a fair price that allows you to get the product you want while still providing me with a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
