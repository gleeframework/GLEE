Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand the product's value, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a good price that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
