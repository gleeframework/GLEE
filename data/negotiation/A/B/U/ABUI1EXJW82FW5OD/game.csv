"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand the product's value, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a good price that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
