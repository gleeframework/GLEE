"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",11200.0,Alice,5,
