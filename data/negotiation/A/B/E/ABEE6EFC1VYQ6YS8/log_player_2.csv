"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  You can save $100,000 by going with John, but there's a chance you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I can offer you a compromise at $1,080,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

``` 

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is only $80,000 more than John's price.  It's worth accepting this offer as it's likely you won't get much lower from Alice."
