"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $180. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  It's important to start high to see how much value Bob places on the product.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with $150. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $120.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to $140 to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still believe the product is worth more than $130.  I'm hoping that this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would ideally prefer to sell for more, I'm running out of time and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob.  Selling to John for $120 is my fallback, but $125 is a good compromise. I'm taking the deal."
