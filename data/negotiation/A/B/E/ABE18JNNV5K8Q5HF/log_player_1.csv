Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. Although it's the best he's offered so far, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can convince him to come up a bit. If he still refuses, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $825,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than selling to John, I'm concerned that further negotiation will just waste time, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better price from Bob.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to make a decisive decision.  I'll accept John's offer and move on."
