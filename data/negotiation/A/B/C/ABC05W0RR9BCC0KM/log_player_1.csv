Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your floor price:**  You're aiming for a profit beyond your minimum acceptable amount.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a clear incentive to accept the offer as he'll still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob pushes back, you can still potentially increase the price a bit. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
