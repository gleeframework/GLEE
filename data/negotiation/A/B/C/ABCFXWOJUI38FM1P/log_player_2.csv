"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice's Value:** Alice values the product at $800,000.  This means there's significant room for negotiation.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob's maximum is $1,200,000, so there's still some room to save money.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 

It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially when there's a significant difference between the seller's value and your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is aggressive, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a good way to see how flexible Alice is. If she's willing to come down to $950,000, Bob has saved $150,000. 
* **Leaving Room:** By not going too low, Bob keeps the door open for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  While it's a step down from her initial price, it's still too high:

* **Alice's Value:** Alice is still well above her value of $800,000.  
* **Bob's Savings:**  While $1,025,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Power:** Alice has already shown some flexibility.  By rejecting her offer, Bob shows he's serious about getting a better price and maintains his negotiation leverage. 

Bob should continue to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  $975,000 is my final offer.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:**  The message emphasizes that this is Bob's final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to accept. 
* **Balance:** The price is still below Alice's latest offer, but it's close enough that she might be willing to accept. It gives her some profit but also saves Bob a significant amount.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that Bob can go to John if they can't agree.

This counteroffer is a balanced approach that allows Bob to potentially close the deal while still saving a substantial amount."
