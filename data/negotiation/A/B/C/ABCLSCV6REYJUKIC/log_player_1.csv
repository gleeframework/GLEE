"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I believe I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still closer to my ideal price. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me!  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John for $80.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
