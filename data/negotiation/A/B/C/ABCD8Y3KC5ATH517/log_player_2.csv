"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no reason to reject her offer. Accepting her offer saves you the hassle of buying from John."
