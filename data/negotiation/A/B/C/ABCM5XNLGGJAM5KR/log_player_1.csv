Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive offer."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $14,999 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slight discount compared to John's offer, might be preferable to waiting. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know for sure that John will definitely buy for $15,000. If John's offer is guaranteed, Alice might as well ask for a price closer to that amount."
