Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $19,000 allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a higher sale price. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I don't have information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above $10,000. If I had more information, I could potentially tailor my offer for a higher chance of success."
