"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm looking for $140 for it. It's definitely worth the price. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate you're interested, $80 is way below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $95? ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $95 is still too low. How about we meet at $105? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go up to $98. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",98.0,Bob,6,
