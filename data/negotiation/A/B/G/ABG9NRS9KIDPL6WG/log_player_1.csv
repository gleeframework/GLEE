"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm looking for $140 for it. It's definitely worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but knowing it's likely too high for Bob. 
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I phrase it as a question to encourage Bob to counteroffer and start the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially come down to a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer.  While I could sell to John for $120, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate you're interested, $80 is way below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the offer:** I'm firm about not accepting Bob's low offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm suggesting a ""middle ground"" to make the offer seem reasonable. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $95?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $95 is still too low. How about we meet at $105? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:**  I show I'm aware of his desire for a lower price, building rapport.
* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm not accepting his last offer but showing willingness to compromise by coming down a bit more.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm framing $105 as a ""fair compromise"", making it sound like the logical next step.
* **Leaving Room for Final Agreement:** I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob, but still leaving a small gap if he needs to counter one last time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go up to $98. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer a higher price, $98 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's better to accept Bob's offer and avoid potentially losing the deal altogether."
