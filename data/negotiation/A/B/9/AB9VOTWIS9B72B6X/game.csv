"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and the uniqueness of the product, $2000000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it.  This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant amount, but I'm still holding out for a better price. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1750000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1500000.  I believe this price is fair given the product's value and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it right now.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1625000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1625000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000, and I believe this is a fair price given our previous negotiations and the product's value. If you're not willing to accept this final offer, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
