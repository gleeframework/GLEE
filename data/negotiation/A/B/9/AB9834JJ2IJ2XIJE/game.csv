"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $105? That's the best I can do.",105.0,Bob,4,
