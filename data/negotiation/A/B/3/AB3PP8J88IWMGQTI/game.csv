"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm able to offer. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below the value I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1350000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is my final offer, as I can always choose to purchase the product from John for $1200000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, which is my next lowest price. I'm starting to think that $1250000 is a bit too low, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
