Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to entice Bob into accepting a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $175 is still below what I'd sell to John, giving me some flexibility if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and leaves very little room for profit. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, it shows he's interested. By rejecting his counteroffer, I can send a new counteroffer closer to my desired price range and potentially get a better deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm framing the price as a compromise that still reflects the value of the product.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing the good price to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely he'll go much higher than $110.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

At this point, the potential for a better deal with Bob is low, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  Therefore, it's more prudent to sell to John and secure my profit."
