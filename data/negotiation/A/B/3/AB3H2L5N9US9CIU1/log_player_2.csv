Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still not enough.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that will work for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal now, let me know if you agree.

Alice is very unlikely to come down significantly from her current offer. It's clear she's anchoring to a price above your maximum, and while she might budge a little more, it's not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $10,000 deal with John."
