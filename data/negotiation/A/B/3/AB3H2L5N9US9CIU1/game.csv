"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000. What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget, I'm getting closer.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is a significant compromise. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let me know your decision.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your patience. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still not enough.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that will work for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal now, let me know if you agree.",12500.0,Alice,7,
