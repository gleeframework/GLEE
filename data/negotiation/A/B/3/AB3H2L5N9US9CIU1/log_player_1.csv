"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear he's trying to lowball me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget, I'm getting closer.  Would you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is a significant compromise. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your patience. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still not enough.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that will work for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal now, let me know if you agree."", ""product_price"": 12500}
