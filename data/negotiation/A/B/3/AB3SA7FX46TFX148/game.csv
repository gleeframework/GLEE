"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this reflects its true value.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,175,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
