I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while giving me a significant discount.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
