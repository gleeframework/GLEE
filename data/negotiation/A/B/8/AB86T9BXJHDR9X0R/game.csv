"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows you a substantial return on your investment, considering the product's worth to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
