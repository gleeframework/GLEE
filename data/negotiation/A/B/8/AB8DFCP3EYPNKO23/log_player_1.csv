Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value of $120. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully is more appealing to Bob than his previous offer, but I'm willing to go lower if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a price closer to my desired value.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  I'll sell the product to John for $120, which at least meets my minimum value."
