"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $11,000 is simply too low.  I can come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is simply not a feasible price for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I hope you can see that this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
