"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of selling this product to you. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it could be a great addition to your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1100000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1050000. This price is still fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1050000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. How about $1075000? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
