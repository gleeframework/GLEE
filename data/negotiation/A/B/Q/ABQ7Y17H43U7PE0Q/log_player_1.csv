Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1050000. This price is still fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. How about $1,075,000? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
