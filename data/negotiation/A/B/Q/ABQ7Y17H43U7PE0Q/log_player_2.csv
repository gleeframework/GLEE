"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of selling this product to you. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it could be a great addition to your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1100000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This price is still fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1050000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. How about $1075000? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still lower than what you would pay to John ($1,000,000).  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial option in this scenario."
