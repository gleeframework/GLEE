"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to be flexible.  I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,250. Can you consider this price?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to make this work.  This is my final offer: $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to move on to other buyers. Let me know your decision.",11000.0,Alice,5,
