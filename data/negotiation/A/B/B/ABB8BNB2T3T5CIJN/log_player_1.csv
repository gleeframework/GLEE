{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This ensures you still make a profit and provides incentive for Bob to accept.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message conveys flexibility and openness to finding a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, if Bob rejects, you can always counteroffer or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than your minimum price of $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested and has expressed a willingness to pay a premium, so a counteroffer could be successful.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than your original offer, but still above his offer.  For example, you could offer $10,500 and explain that you're willing to meet him halfway, but that your product is worth more than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to be flexible.  I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within the negotiation range:** The offer of $10,500 is halfway between your previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This demonstrates willingness to compromise.
* **Highlights mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Maintain your minimum:**  The price is still above your minimum threshold of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below your minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your target price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a final counteroffer:**  Bob has demonstrated willingness to negotiate further, indicating there's still room for a potential deal that benefits both parties.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a final counteroffer, aiming to split the difference once more.  You could offer $11,000 and explain that it's your final offer and that you're willing to take a small loss to close the deal. If he rejects, you can always sell to John for $12,000."
