"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,100,000. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'd be willing to pay $1,075,000 to get this deal done. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1,125,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
