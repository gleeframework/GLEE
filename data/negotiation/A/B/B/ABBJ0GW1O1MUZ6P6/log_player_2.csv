"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum valuation. You have plenty of room to negotiate down, and even if you have to walk away and buy from John, you won't be overpaying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($8,000 vs. $12,000), you establish a strong negotiating position. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer provides space to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and respectful tone, which is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down in price, which is a good sign. However, you're still getting close to your walk-away point (buying from John for $10,000). There's a small amount of room left to negotiate a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** By countering with $8,500, you're showing a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still trying to get a better deal. 
* **Maintaining a Bottom Line:** This counteroffer keeps you safely below your $10,000 walk-away point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message remains open and suggests a continued interest in finding a mutually agreeable price."
