"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $900,000 is still quite high for me.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my own.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $750,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my financial limits.  Let's finalize this agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering its value to you is $1,500,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
