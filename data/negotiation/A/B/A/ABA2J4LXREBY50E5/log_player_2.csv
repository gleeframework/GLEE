"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than John's $800,000, Bob has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer you $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's ideal price:**  $875,000 is only $75,000 more than what Bob could get from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice refusing to budge further, or potentially offering a price higher than $875,000.
* **Limited rounds:**  With 10 rounds, there's a chance Bob could run out of time before securing a better deal. 

Given these factors, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price close to his ideal and avoids the risk of losing the deal or getting a worse offer later."
