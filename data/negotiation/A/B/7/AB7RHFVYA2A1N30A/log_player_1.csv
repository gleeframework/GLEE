""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point, and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding our $12,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, but still keeps us well above our minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the safety net of John who will buy it at $12,000, so we don't need to drastically undersell. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
