"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my [product name] at a very competitive price, knowing it's worth significantly more to you.  Let's discuss a mutually beneficial deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit.** Her message emphasizes that the product is worth more to you. 
* **You have a fallback option.** John offers the product at your maximum price, so you won't be left without.
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might come back with a lower price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
