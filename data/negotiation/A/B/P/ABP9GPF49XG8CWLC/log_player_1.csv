Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still holding out for a better price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,200 is getting closer to my minimum of $8,000, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more before considering selling to John."

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I've already made a counteroffer and he rejected it.  I don't want to risk going another round with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000."
