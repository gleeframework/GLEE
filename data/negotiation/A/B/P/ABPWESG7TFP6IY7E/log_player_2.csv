"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  While $11,000 is a good price,  it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  Bob should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $9,500. This feels like a more reasonable price considering your value for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than the price from John and closer to Bob's desired price range.  There's always the risk of further negotiation, but at this point, it's likely that Bob will not be able to get a lower price without potentially losing the deal."
