"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $825000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.
