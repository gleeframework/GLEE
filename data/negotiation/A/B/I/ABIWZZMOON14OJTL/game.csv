"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit your operations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually agreeable arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That number is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $1,000,000 to make it work on my end. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This acknowledges the value it brings while finding a compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest, $1,800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle around $1,300,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while working within my constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I see where you're coming from, but that price point is still a bit too low for me to feel comfortable.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to make this deal work.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, to be completely transparent,  $1,650,000 is pushing the absolute limit of what I can realistically afford. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
