"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit your operations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually agreeable arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to start negotiating to see if she's willing to come down to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That number is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $1,000,000 to make it work on my end. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:** This counteroffer sends a clear signal that Alice's initial price is unacceptable. Starting significantly lower gives more room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason (""make it work on my end"") helps to frame the counteroffer as a necessity rather than an arbitrary lowball."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This acknowledges the value it brings while finding a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $1,800,000 is significantly above your $800,000 limit. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice's willingness to negotiate is a good sign. Continued counteroffers may lead to a more acceptable price. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you have the option to go with John if the negotiations don't land in a comfortable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest, $1,800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle around $1,300,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while working within my constraints."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** We're making steady progress with Alice. Another counteroffer keeps the momentum going.
* **Strategic Concession:** While $1,300,000 is still above your ideal price, it shows a willingness to move closer to Alice's range.
* **Deadline Awareness:** We have plenty of rounds left, but remaining firm on the budget is key.  We don't want to get too close to the end without reaching an agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I see where you're coming from, but that price point is still a bit too low for me to feel comfortable.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Progress:** Alice's concessions are getting smaller. It might be time to consider a bolder move to signal the seriousness of your budget limitations.
* **Midpoint Approaching:** We're getting closer to a potential midpoint in the negotiations.  Sticking to our guns is important to avoid being pushed too high.
* **John Remains an Option:**  It's good to keep John in mind. While we want to get a deal with Alice, we won't accept a price that's significantly detrimental."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, to be completely transparent,  $1,650,000 is pushing the absolute limit of what I can realistically afford. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Stance:**  We're getting into the later rounds, so it's time to communicate the urgency of our budget constraints more directly.
* **Transparency and Fairness:** By being upfront about the budget limit, we're emphasizing that our offers are serious and not arbitrary.
* **Maintaining Ground:** While we're increasing our offer slightly, we're holding firm below the $1,300,000 mark to avoid getting drawn into a price range we can't afford. 
* **Call to Action:** Ending with a direct question (""Let me know if this works for you"") encourages a clear and prompt response from Alice."
