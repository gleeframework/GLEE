"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. This exceptional item holds immense value for me, but I understand its true worth lies in its utility to you. Given its significance, I am offering it to you at a special price of $9,500. This offer is exclusive to you and represents an opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a price slightly above its intrinsic value to you. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both the product's worth and your budget. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I am looking forward to the possibility of serving you with this remarkable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is compelling, it's still above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding with your backup plan of buying from John."
