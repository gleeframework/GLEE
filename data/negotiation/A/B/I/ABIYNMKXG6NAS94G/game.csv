"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $11750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're still stuck on the $10000 price, but I'm starting to lose patience. I've already made concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll give you one final chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $11250. This is my last offer, and I expect a decision from you.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $11250, and your latest offer of $10500 is still too low. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $11250, but if you don't take it, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer.",11250.0,Alice,9,
