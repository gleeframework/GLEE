,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. Can you consider that?",12800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $12800 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13500.  This still represents a good value for you, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12900. Can you consider that?",12900.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $12900 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13200.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  What do you say?",13200.0,Alice,5,
