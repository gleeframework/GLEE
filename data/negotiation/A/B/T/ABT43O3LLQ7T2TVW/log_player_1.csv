"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible in the limited rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a good deal for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds leading to a lower price or a sale to John."
