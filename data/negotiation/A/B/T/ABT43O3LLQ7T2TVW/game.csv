"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
