"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $8000 to $9000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet my needs?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $9500? It's a fair price that acknowledges your needs and also ensures I'm able to make a decent profit.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I believe $9000 would be a fair price for both of us. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while still acknowledging the value of your product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
