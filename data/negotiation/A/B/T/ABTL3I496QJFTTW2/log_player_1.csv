Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing us closer to our ideal outcome. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a strong alternative buyer in John, ensuring we won't be forced to go below our minimum price. This knowledge allows us to confidently set a higher initial offer."
