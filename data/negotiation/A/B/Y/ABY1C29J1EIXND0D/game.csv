,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above that price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, I can't go as low as $9,000. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'd love to find a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
