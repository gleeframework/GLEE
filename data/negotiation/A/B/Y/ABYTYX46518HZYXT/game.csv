"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm a bit of a savvy buyer, and I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'm thinking of a price of $10800. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10800. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $10500 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from my original offer of $9000. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $11200. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go up to $11200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $10600. I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price. What do you think?",10600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not willing to meet me at $11200, but I'm not willing to go down much further either. I'll meet you halfway from your offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $10800. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
