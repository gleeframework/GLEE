"Alice,  $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit too much for me. How about we settle at $15,250?  It's a fair compromise and closer to where I need to be.",15250.0,Bob,4,
