"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product is significant. Let me know your thoughts!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  However, I'm flexible. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for negotiation.  $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so it's worthwhile to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise between our initial positions. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my need to get a reasonable return. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still slightly higher than his budget. Bob can still attempt to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  There's still room for a counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
