Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into the negotiation so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

While I could be stubborn and try to get the price down to $800,000, accepting the $850,000 offer makes the most sense at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Saving money:** I'm still saving $150,000 compared to Alice's original offer.
* **Time value:**  Every round spent negotiating is time I could be using the product or pursuing other opportunities.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings of $50,000 by continuing to negotiate might not outweigh the risk of Alice retracting her offer or the deal falling through."
