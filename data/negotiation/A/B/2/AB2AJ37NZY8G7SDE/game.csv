"I understand that $6,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?  That's a considerable jump on my end.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
