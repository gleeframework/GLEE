"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that I might have to explore other options if we can't meet in the middle. Can you consider this price?",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $795000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $795000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $785000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",785000.0,Bob,6,
