"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $17,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",14500.0,Bob,4,
