"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and a good start for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000.  Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate with Bob or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would still be a good price for you, while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is closer to my budget, but still a little high.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 6 rounds left, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target. If the negotiations don't go well, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you - you're trying to get the best deal possible.  But $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's make a final compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,250.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your budget and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
