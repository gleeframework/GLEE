"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000.  Would you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would still be a good price for you, while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is closer to my budget, but still a little high.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you - you're trying to get the best deal possible.  But $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's make a final compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,250.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your budget and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
