"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product will bring to you.",8750.0,Alice,3,
