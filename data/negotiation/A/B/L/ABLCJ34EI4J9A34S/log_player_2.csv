"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $9,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is lower than what Bob would pay to John ($10,000).  It's also close to Bob's counteroffer of $8,500, indicating that further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer is the best option for Bob, as it secures the product at a reasonable price."
