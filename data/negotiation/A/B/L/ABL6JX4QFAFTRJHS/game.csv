"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below my initial assessment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",880000.0,Bob,4,
