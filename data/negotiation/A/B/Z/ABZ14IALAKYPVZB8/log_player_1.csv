"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  This price is lower than my minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing it as a great deal for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Early Bird:** This is a good opening offer to see where Bob stands and potentially get the negotiation rolling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I have 8 rounds left and can likely squeeze out a better deal than Bob's current offer.  
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $1,150,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to make this happen. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** I'm not dropping too much from my initial offer, showing I'm serious about my asking price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential benefit of accepting.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using phrases like ""find a solution"" to signal willingness to negotiate while staying firm. 
* **Room for Movement:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go up to $1,150,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:**  Knowing John will pay $1,500,000 makes me less inclined to settle for a lower offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** We have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob with some strategic maneuvering.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob and explore ways to bridge the gap between our offers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm reiterating that Bob's offer is unacceptable but also offering a counter that's closer to his last offer.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""mutually beneficial"" to highlight the potential for compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him and how this offer is still a good deal.
* **Strategic Move:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for an unreasonable price.

**Next Steps:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared for another round of negotiation if necessary. With John's offer as a backup, I have the leverage to hold firm and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  
* **Bob's offer is getting lower:** Bob is consistently offering lower prices, showing he's unwilling to budge significantly.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a sure thing, and I'm running out of time to get a better deal from Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  While I would like to get more from Bob, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that he will meet my minimum price. I'm better off selling to John and securing the guaranteed $1,500,000, especially with limited time remaining."
