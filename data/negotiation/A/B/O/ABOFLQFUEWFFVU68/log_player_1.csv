"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's slightly more than what the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages him to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is sticking to his offer, and it's getting close to my minimum. It's risky to keep negotiating, as we're nearing the halfway point and I might not get a better deal.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit, and there's always a chance I could get a better deal with John later."
