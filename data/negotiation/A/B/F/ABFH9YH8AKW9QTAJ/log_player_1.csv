Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** By offering the product at $19,000, you are aiming slightly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000. While this might seem high, it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price higher than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, providing a safety net if Bob rejects your offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some leverage in the negotiation. If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or has other options, you might adjust your initial offer accordingly."
