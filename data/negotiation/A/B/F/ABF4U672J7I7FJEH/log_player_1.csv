``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, considering the product's worth to Bob. It's a substantial profit for me, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is still a good profit, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $1,100,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $1,050,000? It's the highest I can go, but I really want this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is still significantly above my minimum and a good deal. It's better than risking a further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $800,000."
