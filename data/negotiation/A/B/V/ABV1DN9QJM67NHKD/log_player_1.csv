Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $180 allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If negotiations fail, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $120, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the price doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  
* **John as a safety net:** I have a backup offer from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low. 

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $140, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $140 is still above my minimum of $120, but allows for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive Language:**  The message is polite and encourages Bob to consider the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Higher Offers:** While I'd prefer more, it's unlikely Bob will go higher. 
* **Risk of Losing Sale:** Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further negotiation, but there's a risk he'll walk away, forcing me to sell to John for less.  

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's close to my minimum and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
