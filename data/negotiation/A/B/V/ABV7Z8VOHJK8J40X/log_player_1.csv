Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, trying to get a higher price from Bob first makes sense.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so offering it at $99 leaves room for negotiation but keeps the price above his perceived value.
* **""Special price"" framing:**  Positioning the price as a ""special"" deal might make Bob more inclined to accept. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for the guaranteed $100. There's no need to go below $100 with Bob as I have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
