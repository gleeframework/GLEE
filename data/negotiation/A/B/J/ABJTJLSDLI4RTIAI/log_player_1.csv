Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, given its potential benefits. I'm willing to sell it for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Consider the Alternative:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $80 (to John), so I need to make sure Bob's offer is enticing enough to beat that baseline.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
