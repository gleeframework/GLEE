"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, given its potential benefits. I'm willing to sell it for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly aiming for a price that gives her a good profit margin.  It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
