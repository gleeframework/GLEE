Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,450,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, it's always best to try and get a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product to Bob at $1,450,000 creates a strong incentive for him to buy. He gains $50,000 in value ($1,500,000 - $1,450,000) compared to if he lets the deal fall through.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties, you create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
