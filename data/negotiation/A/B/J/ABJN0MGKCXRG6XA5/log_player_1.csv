I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $75. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $75 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $80 meets my minimum price. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is also willing to pay $80."
