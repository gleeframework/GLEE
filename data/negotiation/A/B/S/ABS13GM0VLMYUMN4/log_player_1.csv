"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to move forward.  I'm willing to offer $700000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference?  I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Let's try $850000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to my minimum threshold of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept his offer and close the deal.  There's always a risk that he'll reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to jeopardize this sale."
