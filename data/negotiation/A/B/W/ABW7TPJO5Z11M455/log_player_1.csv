Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for a counteroffer:** I'm not asking for my full desired value, anticipating Bob might counter. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation. 
* **Plan B:** I'm always aware of John's offer, so I won't be afraid to walk away if negotiations go nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your potential gains. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum:**  While it's a step closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially securing a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  I'm pushing back slightly,  countering with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing that I'm already making a significant compromise by coming down from my previous offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for further discussion and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While $1,080,000 is closer to John's offer, it's still a decent deal for me and leaves open the possibility of securing a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,080,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm prepared to offer $1,060,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations are stalling:** We're getting close to a price that works for Bob, but we're still below my minimum.  Continuing to counteroffer might lead to a long and unproductive negotiation.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  John's offer is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirements. 
* **Time is a factor:**  It's better to secure a guaranteed deal with John than risk further negotiation with Bob. 

I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and I can avoid the risk of a lengthy and potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
