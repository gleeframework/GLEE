"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,250?  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,500. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
