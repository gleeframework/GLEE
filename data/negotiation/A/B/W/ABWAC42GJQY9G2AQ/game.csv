,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still gives you a good deal and leaves me some room to profit.  Let's see if we can make this work!",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While $7,750 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,250.  This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
