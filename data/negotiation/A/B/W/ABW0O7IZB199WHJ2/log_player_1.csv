Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to his perceived value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer gives Alice the flexibility to lower the price if Bob counters, making him feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Backup Offer:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price for Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price to reach an agreement, keeping in mind her minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
