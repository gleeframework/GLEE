"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $15,000 for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $7,000? That's a significant move on my part, showing I'm serious about buying.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,000 for the product. This is my best price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",9000.0,Alice,5,
