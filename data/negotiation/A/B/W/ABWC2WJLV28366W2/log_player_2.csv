Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $7,000? That's a significant move on my part, showing I'm serious about buying."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,000 for the product. This is my best price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk further negotiation with Alice."
