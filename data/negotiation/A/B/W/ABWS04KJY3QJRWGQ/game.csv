"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's currently outside my budget. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850000.  This reflects a significant discount and a good starting point for further negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm offering $900000, which is closer to my budget and still a good deal for both of us.  This would allow us to close the deal quickly.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to bridge the gap, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $925000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $925000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $910000. This offer is closer to my budget and shows that I'm serious about buying the product.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we work together.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $910000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that this is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're at a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $915000. This is a small increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $915000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $912000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal and closing this negotiation quickly.  How does that sound to you?",912000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $918000. This is a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",918000.0,Alice,9,
