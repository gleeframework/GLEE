"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  However, I have another buyer, John, who is also very interested and ready to purchase it at the same price.  Please let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice is clearly trying to pressure you with the mention of another buyer (""John""). However, you already know that John will sell you the product for $1,200,000.  Therefore, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at the same price.
