(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to immediately buy from Alice when you know you have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer,  $7,000, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is significantly less than her initial offer, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

Alice's offer is a good deal.  It's within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
