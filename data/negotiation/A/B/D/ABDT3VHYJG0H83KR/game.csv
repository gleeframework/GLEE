"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too close to my budget's limit. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $985000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000. I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement, but I need to make a decision soon.",985000.0,Bob,10,
