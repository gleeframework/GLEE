"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $9000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I can compromise, but I need to make a living. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9750. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $9750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been patient, but I've made it clear that $9500 is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think we're just going around in circles. I'm willing to make one last attempt to close the deal, but I need you to meet me at $9750. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we've been going back and forth, but I'm still not willing to pay $9750. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If I don't get a yes, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",9500.0,Bob,10,
