"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,000 is still a little steep for me. How about $9,500? That would work for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
