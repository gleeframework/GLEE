Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves you room to lower the price if necessary. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob knows exactly what you're proposing. 

Let me know how Bob responds and we'll continue from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is a decent profit, it's still quite low, and I'm aiming for the maximum. It's also good to remember that John is willing to pay $150, so rejecting this offer to see if I can get closer to my target is the best strategy.  

Let's counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to go a little lower. How about $135? It's a great price for such a fantastic product, and it leaves both of us with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's value, but closer to his offer, potentially leading to a successful negotiation. It's also important to keep reminding Bob of the product's value and the great deal he's getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good compromise. Bob's offer of $130 is a significant improvement from his initial $125 offer and brings us closer to our desired profit margin.  While $150 from John is tempting, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and limits the risk of further negotiation. It's a good deal for both parties."
