"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Offering $1,000,000 allows for a potential compromise without sacrificing my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Setting the Tone:** My message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product, rather than just stating a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I have 9 rounds left, and I believe there's room for a counteroffer that will get us closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, I want to explore if I can potentially get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my price is still reasonable.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative approach, hoping to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This offer still saves me a good amount compared to your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left and believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially higher offer from Bob. I want to see if we can reach a compromise that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still within your budget. I hope we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer, but not too far:** I'm lowering my price again, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly adding urgency by mentioning that I hope we can reach an agreement soon. This could make Bob more willing to compromise."
