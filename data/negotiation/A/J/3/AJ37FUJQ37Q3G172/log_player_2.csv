"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still within your budget. I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly staying above our acceptable price point.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach $800,000.  We have a guaranteed option with John at that price, so it's time to cut our losses and secure the product."
