Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than what the product is worth to Bob, so there's potential for him to counteroffer.
* **Offers a good deal:**  It's higher than my minimum selling price, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Shows confidence:** By starting high, it shows that I believe in the value of my product. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer of $110 is still profitable for me, and it's close to my initial offer. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a failed sale."
