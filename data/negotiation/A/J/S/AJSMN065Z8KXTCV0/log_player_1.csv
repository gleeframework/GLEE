"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($800,000), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $750,000, I'll increase the price to $850,000, which is still lower than the original price of $1,200,000 that Bob is willing to pay, but higher than his initial offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
