"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. 

This first offer is a test. It will give me insight into Bob's potential budget and his interest level. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of how to proceed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell the product for my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's immediate offer of $1,500,000 is a good starting point, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit margin. I believe it's a fair price, considering Bob's initial offer and my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for Bob, encouraging him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is clearly trying to push for a lower price, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  It's getting close to my minimum, but I still have some room to negotiate and I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob, encouraging him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm getting concerned.  While I still want to get the best price, I'm not sure if we'll reach an agreement with Bob.  To avoid further risk of a lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  This is my minimum price, and it guarantees a sale.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
