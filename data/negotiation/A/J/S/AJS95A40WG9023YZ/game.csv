"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, $790,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $820,000.  This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",820000.0,Alice,3,
