"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $800000. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the potential value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $900000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $975000.  I believe this price is fair given the value of the product and our back-and-forth.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1025000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1000000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
