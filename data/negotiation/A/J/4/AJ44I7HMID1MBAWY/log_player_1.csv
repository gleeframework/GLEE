Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), giving him incentive to negotiate and potentially close the deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still above your minimum price and you are guaranteed a sale. It's likely that he won't come up to your original offer, so accepting his counteroffer is the best option in this scenario."
