(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,300 is very close to your target of $12,000. While you can still reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price, it's risky. You have only one round left and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer.  

Considering the value of the product and the fact that John is willing to sell it for $12,000, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a slightly higher price, but you're still within your budget and securing the product."
