"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,200,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
