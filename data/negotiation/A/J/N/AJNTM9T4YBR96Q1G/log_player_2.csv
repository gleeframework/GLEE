"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're comfortable with.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,200,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
