Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $14,999. I know you'll benefit greatly from it, and this is a limited-time offer you don't want to miss."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could accept John's offer of $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed sale price ($15,000) creates a sense of urgency and high perceived value. It might entice Bob to buy, thinking he's getting a great deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of an extra $1,119 ($14,999 - $13,880) makes it a risk worth taking."
