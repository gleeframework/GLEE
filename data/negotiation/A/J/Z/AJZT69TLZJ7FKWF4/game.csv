"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I see your point, Alice. Let's try $11000. It's a bit higher than my initial proposal, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $11000 is sufficient. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $12200. This is the last time I'm willing to budge, so I hope we can meet in the middle. What are your thoughts?",12200.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final attempt to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to go, and I believe it's the last chance for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,9,
