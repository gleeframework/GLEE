"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to consider purchasing it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to accommodate you while still ensuring fair value for our product. I propose a price of $8,500 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer, aiming to meet both our needs.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial counteroffer. Could you meet me in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
