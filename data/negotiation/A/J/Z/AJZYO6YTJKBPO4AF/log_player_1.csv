"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum value but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm not quite ready to pay $140. I'm willing to offer you $125 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell the product for significantly less than my minimum value. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $130 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $132.50. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
