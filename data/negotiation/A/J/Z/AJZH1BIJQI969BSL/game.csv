"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $16,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the benefits it brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement if we keep negotiating.",12000.0,Bob,4,
