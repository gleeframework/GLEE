Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer aims for a good middle ground:

* **It's higher than my minimum:**  $9,500 is above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's a strong starting point:**  A high initial offer shows confidence and potentially sets a higher negotiation floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still secure a better price by counter-offering. 

* **Reasoning:**
    * **Potential for higher price:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  A counteroffer might push him closer to my desired price.
    * **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 
    * **Opportunity to gather information:**  His counteroffer provides valuable insight into his budget and willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** $9,000 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reminds Bob of the product's value, which might encourage him to meet me halfway. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further discussion, preventing a stalemate."
