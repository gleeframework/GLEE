Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to meet with me. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000. I think this is a fair starting point for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
