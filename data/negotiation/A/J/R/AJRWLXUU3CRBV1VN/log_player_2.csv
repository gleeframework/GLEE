"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds and can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to meet with me. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000. I think this is a fair starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000. I believe this price represents a good balance between the value it offers and a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. You have plenty of rounds left and can always go to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. I'm confident that we can come to an agreement if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 900000}
