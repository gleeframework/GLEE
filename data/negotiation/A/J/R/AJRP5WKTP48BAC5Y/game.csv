"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could come down to $975,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects the value this product brings.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $750,000 is still too low for me to consider.  My final offer is $875,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
