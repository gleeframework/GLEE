"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which reflects the value I see in the product.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you see the value in the product, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I can comfortably go. Let's split the difference and go with $1,125,000.  This shows a real commitment to reaching an agreement, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,125,000. I'm willing to go slightly higher, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm happy to continue working towards an agreement.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,135,000, which shows a genuine commitment to closing this deal.  What do you think?",1135000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm getting close to meeting you, but I still need to make sure I'm getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,140,000, which is just $5,000 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and our discussions. What are your thoughts?",1140000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility throughout this process.  While $1,140,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,137,500, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers and the value of the product.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal with a small adjustment.",1137500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one final concession to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,138,750. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1138750.0,Alice,9,
