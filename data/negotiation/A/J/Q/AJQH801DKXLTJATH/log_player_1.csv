Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can get at least $10,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at $13,000, which is above my minimum threshold of $10,000.  While I initially wanted to get more, there's no guarantee that I can get a better price in further negotiation rounds.  Selling to Bob for $13,000 is a safe and acceptable outcome, so I'm accepting his offer."
