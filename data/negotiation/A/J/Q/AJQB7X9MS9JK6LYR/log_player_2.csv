Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85, and it's better to get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John than risk the negotiation going nowhere."
