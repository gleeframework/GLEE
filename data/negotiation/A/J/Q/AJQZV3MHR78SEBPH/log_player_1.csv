``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. It's important to remember that I can always go lower if necessary. I'm keeping John in the back of my mind as my safety net, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to take $10,500, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a more agreeable price.  I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price, but I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my minimum."
