Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or for you to slightly lower the price if needed. 
* **Stay Above Your Minimum:** The $149 price ensures you make a significant profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
 
This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
