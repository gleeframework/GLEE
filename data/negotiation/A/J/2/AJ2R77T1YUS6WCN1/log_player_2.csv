# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,800,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.
