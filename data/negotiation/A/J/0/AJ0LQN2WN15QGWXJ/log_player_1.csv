Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 15,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $12,000. Since this is the minimum value the product has to me, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $12,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
