Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you've been eyeing it, and its value is undeniable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high demand and value, justifying the price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Goal:** The aim is to secure a price significantly higher than your minimum. While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, the potential gain from his acceptance outweighs the risk of going straight to John."
