"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $110 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. After considering our previous discussions, I believe a fair price would be $110. This aligns better with my financial plans while still allowing me to benefit from your unique product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a reasonable price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $112.50. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me halfway. I'll offer it to you for $114. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider selling it to someone else. What do you think?",114.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but after careful consideration, I believe the fair price for your product should be $110. This aligns well with my budget and the value I see in your product. I hope this final proposal is acceptable.",110.0,Bob,10,
