"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me is $10,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a serious offer of $9,000 for the product. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price, but I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
