"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $975,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
