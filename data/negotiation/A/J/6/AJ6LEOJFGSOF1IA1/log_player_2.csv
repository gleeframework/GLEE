"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's starting price is higher than your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate the price down."

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting low, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but are also looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still $50,000 over your maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, so there's a chance to get the price closer to your target.
* **John as Backup:** You still have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest, my absolute top limit for this is $975,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows Alice that you're serious and have a hard limit, but it's still within a reasonable negotiating range.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating you're ""ready to close the deal today,"" you add a bit of pressure for Alice to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts you $25,000 below your maximum budget, leaving a small buffer for a potential final compromise without exceeding $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $975,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer and the lowest she's willing to go.
* **Over Budget:** Even with her concession, the price of $1,025,000 is still $25,000 over your maximum budget.
* **John is the Safe Bet:** You have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring you stay within your budget. 

While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's a risk she won't budge, and you'll end up having to go with John anyway. At this point, the risk outweighs the potential reward of saving an additional $25,000."
