"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking around $7000. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking of a price around $7200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",7200.0,Bob,4,
