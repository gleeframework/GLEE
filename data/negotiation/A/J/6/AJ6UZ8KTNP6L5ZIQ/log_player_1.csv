Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight at the moment. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment while staying within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
