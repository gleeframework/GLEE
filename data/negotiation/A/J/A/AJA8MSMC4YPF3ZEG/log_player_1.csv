Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum desired price. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary, while still trying to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to accept $120, it's still not worth it for me. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price from $175 to $140,  which is closer to Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise, but still leaves a decent margin for me. I believe this is a fair price that could potentially entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already lowered my price twice.  Rather than continue negotiating and potentially risk getting a lower price, I'll sell the product to John for $150. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum desired earnings."
