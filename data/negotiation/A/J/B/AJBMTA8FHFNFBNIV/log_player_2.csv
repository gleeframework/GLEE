# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. Given its exceptional quality and functionality, we believe it's truly worth more than its face value. Considering its intrinsic value to you, we propose a special introductory price of $120. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant savings compared to the market value. We're confident it will exceed your expectations. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is less than John's price of $150. 
* However, you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($80). This suggests there might be room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that the price is too high. She might counter-offer with a lower price, getting you a better deal."
