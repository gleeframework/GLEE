"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $100.  It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target. There's still a chance to get a better deal, especially since I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise.  However, it's still below her last offer, giving her room to negotiate. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and could lead to a deal."
