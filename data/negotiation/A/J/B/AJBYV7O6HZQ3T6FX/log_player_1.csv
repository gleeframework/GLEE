"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Ambition:** My goal is to maximize profit, so I'm aiming for a substantial markup.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will give me an idea of Bob's seriousness and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I'm aiming for. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial ask.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to counter with a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have plenty of time to negotiate a better deal. Selling to John now would be settling for less than I could potentially achieve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to come down from my initial ask, but I'm still holding out for a profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a decent return.
* **Middle Ground:**  $1,350,000 sits in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I maintain pressure and show him that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd love to squeeze out a bit more, I'm recognizing the value of closing the deal.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  If I continue to reject offers, I risk Bob getting frustrated and walking away.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price from John."
