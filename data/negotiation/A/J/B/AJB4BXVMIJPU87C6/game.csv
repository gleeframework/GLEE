"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $650,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows you to make a substantial profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. To be fair to both of us, I can go up to $725,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about this deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $787,500. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",787500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both need to walk away happy.  How about $760,000? It's a strong offer, and it avoids dragging this negotiation on any further.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle at $770,000. It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal quickly.",770000.0,Alice,7,
