Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think?,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $82. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's my final offer. Can you accept that?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer it to you for $80.50. It's a bit higher than your final offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $80.50. Can you sell it to me for $80.25?",80.25,Bob,6,
