Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $110 is a good starting point:
    * It's significantly lower than your guaranteed price, making it more appealing to Bob.
    * It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob first, you create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially pushing him to accept. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down towards $80, keeping in mind your $120 safety net with John."
