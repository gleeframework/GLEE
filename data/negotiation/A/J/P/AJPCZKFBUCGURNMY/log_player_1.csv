Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Justification for the price:**  Vaguely mentioning ""potential"" and ""benefits""  attempts to frame the price as justified without revealing too much about your minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high starting price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum.

**Important:** This is a single-round offer. In a real negotiation, be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
