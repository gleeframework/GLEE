Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is close to my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm not being rigid and leaving the door open for counteroffers.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. 
* If he offers a price significantly lower than my minimum, I'll likely counter with a higher price or even end negotiations and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While it's a good offer for Bob, I'm not willing to sell for that low.
* **I have a guaranteed sale with John for a higher price.**  There's no reason to risk losing more money by accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but still lower than John's offer.  This way I'm giving Bob a chance to get closer to my desired price while also protecting my own interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still stand my ground.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob and emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  I'm using language like ""split the difference"" and ""get us closer to a deal"" to encourage a positive outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider his counteroffer. 
* If his counteroffer is still significantly lower than my minimum, I'll likely sell to John.  However, if Bob gets closer to my desired price, I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I can't justify going higher than $1,250,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While he's moved closer, it's not enough for me to consider.
* **I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price.**  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when I have a better option available.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll reach out to John and finalize the sale. I'm happy to secure a deal that meets my minimum price and provides me with the best possible outcome."
