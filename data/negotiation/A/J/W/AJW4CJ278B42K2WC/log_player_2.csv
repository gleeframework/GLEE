"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her value of the product, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay from John. You can likely negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation.  You're offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than your fallback option with John. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also making it clear you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While you'd like to save even more, it's a good compromise and worth accepting to secure the product.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
