Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm starting the price at $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $20,000. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial price.  Would you consider $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $18,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, it's better to accept the offer. Bob is consistently meeting in the middle, and while there might be a small chance of squeezing out a bit more, the difference is getting insignificant. Accepting the $18,500 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.
