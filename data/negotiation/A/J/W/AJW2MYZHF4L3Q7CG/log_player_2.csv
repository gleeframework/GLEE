"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,325,000 is still beyond my budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,312,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $1,200,000.  While continuing negotiations might lead to a lower price from Alice, there's no guarantee of success, and Bob is running out of time (only 3 rounds left).  It's more prudent to secure the product at a known price than risk losing it altogether."
