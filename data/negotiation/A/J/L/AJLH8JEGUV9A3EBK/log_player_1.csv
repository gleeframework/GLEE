Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Start by aiming high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value makes it seem like a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies there's room for discussion, allowing Bob to feel involved while you maintain control of the negotiation. 

**Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate down slightly or accept John's offer as your safety net."
