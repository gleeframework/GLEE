"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring you earn a decent amount. It also sets a positive and friendly tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to sell below my minimum threshold just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,200? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9100? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,100 isn't ideal, it's a good compromise, and it's closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer.  I'm also considering the possibility that he might not budge further, and I could end up losing out on a good deal."
