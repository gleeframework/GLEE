"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even though the price is ambitious, it sets a reference point that may influence Bob's counter-offers.
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can be persuasive.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gradually decrease the asking price while trying to extract as much value as possible.  We will closely observe Bob's reactions and counter-offers to adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds.  If negotiations stall or Bob's offers remain too low, we have the option to walk away and sell to John for our guaranteed minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I aim to achieve. I believe there's room for negotiation, and accepting this offer would be leaving money on the table. 

**Strategy:**

In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but reflects a willingness to negotiate. This will hopefully encourage Bob to raise his offer further while demonstrating flexibility on my part."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the value, the product's unique features and potential benefits warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this offer reflects the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant decrease in my asking price ($300,000) to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. This move should hopefully encourage him to make a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Holding Ground:** However, the new offer of $1,900,000 is still considerably higher than both his initial offer and my minimum.  This keeps the negotiation moving while ensuring I don't settle too quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to reinforce the product's unique value, subtly justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I understand the product's unique features, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 now matches my minimum acceptable price and the amount John is willing to pay. While I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher price, it's risky.  Bob seems to have a firm limit, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate. 

**Outcome:**

It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,500,000 now than risk losing the sale altogether."
