"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I really like the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. How about $135? That's a good compromise and still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
