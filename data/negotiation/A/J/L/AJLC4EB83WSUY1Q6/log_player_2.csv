"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $112 is lower than John's price of $120, making it the best deal for Bob. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might stick to her price and Bob would have to pay more with John. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price."
