Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. While I understand your perspective, I've invested significantly in this product and need to recoup those costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? This price still provides you with a substantial value gain and ensures a fair outcome for both of us.
