Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as he still gets to buy the product for less than its worth to him. However, it also leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum goal of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value it at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can secure a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and still provides Bob with a good deal. Accepting this offer is the best choice in this scenario."
