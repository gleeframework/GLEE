"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value it at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
