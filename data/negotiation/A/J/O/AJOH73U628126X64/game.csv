"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation. I'm open to further discussion, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still significant.  While I understand your desire to save, I believe the true value of this product is much higher.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair return on a valuable asset.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your initial offer was $1,300,000 and you've reduced it to $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,150,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
