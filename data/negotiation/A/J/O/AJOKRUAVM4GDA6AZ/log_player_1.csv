Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $120. It's my minimum price, but I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
