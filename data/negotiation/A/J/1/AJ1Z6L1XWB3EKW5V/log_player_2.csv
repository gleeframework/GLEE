Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I think the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,050,000. This is my last chance to get a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.
