"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is a good starting point to see how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's room to negotiate further and try to reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly to $180.  It's a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it will encourage him to come closer to my ideal selling point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $170.  It's a good price and higher than selling to John. While I'd still prefer to get closer to my original asking price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
