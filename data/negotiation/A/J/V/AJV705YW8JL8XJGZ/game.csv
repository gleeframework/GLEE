"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,000,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $975,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
