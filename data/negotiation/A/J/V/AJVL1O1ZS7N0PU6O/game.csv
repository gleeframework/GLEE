"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects the true value of this product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
