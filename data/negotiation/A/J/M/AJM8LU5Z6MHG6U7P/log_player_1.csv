"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for the minimum price just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
