"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell at that price. Bob is willing to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a significant amount above his offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will make him think more seriously about my product's value and potentially bridge the gap between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not ready to sell at that price. John is a safe option at $12,000, but I'm hoping I can push Bob to come closer to that number. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $13,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I still believe the product is worth more than his last offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm starting to lose faith in the negotiation.  While I'd prefer to make a profit, I'm not comfortable with the current offers. Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
