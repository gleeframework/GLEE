Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 gives Alice room to negotiate above that price.
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives Alice leverage. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By framing the offer as time-sensitive and exclusive, Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.

**Why this approach is better than offering a price too close to Bob's valuation:**

While offering the product at, say, $8,500 might seem tempting to ensure a sale, it leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing Alice's profit."
