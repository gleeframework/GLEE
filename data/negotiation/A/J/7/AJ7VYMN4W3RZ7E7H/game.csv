"Alice, your product looks great, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's try to find common ground.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,750 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm prepared to offer $16,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on. ",16250.0,Bob,6,
