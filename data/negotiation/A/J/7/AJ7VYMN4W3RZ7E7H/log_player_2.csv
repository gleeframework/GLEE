"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I've priced this product competitively based on its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my sincerity, I'm willing to come down to $16,750. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,750 is closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit higher than his maximum budget of $15,000.  With only a few rounds left, Bob should still try to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to drop the price further.  If not, he can always buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,750 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm prepared to offer $16,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on. "", ""product_price"": 16250}
