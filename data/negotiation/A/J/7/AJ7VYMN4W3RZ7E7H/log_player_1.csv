Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my sincerity, I'm willing to come down to $16,750. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,750 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm prepared to offer $16,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are getting close to the point where the difference is negligible. It's better to secure the deal at $16,250 than risk him walking away and getting only $15,000 from John."
