"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still more than the product's worth to Bob ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above the product's worth to Alice.  A counteroffer of $7,000 is a strong starting point. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing Bob to potentially save a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting and counteroffering again is the best strategy. Bob can try to push for a lower price. There are still enough rounds left for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price point, but still wants to save some money.  A counteroffer of $8,000 shows a willingness to negotiate, while still leaving some room for compromise. This may be enough to entice Alice to accept, or at least push her towards a lower price in the next round."
