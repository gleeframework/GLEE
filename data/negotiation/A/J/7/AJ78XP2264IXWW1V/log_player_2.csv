"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will significantly enhance your business operations and bring substantial value to your company. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, it is worth $1,000,000 to us. However, I understand that negotiations are key in achieving a mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, I am extending an offer to purchase this product for $950,000. This price not only ensures a fair profit for us but also provides you with significant savings compared to its market value. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you need more information to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and leaves little room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. 
* While you could buy from John for $1,000,000, there's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale entirely."
