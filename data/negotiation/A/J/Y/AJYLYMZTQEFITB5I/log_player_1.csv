Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,400,000.  Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I won't go below that.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  There's a significant gap between our valuations.
* **Negotiation:** I'm starting high, but leaving room for negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can work towards a mutually acceptable price.
* **Plan B:** I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price.

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to my minimum while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I value the product at.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my target.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, which makes me less pressured to accept a low price.
* **Negotiation Power:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power and demonstrate my willingness to hold out for a better deal.
* **Potential Compromise:** There's still room for a compromise.  I'll likely counter with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,300,000.  This is a counteroffer that:

* **Is Higher Than Bob's Offer:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to move closer to my price, but I'm not willing to accept his initial offer.
* **Is Lower Than My Initial Offer:**  I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Is Still Above My Minimum:** I'm remaining firm in my valuation of the product. 

This strategy is designed to:

* **Find a Middle Ground:** By meeting Bob halfway, I increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation. 
* **Maintain Pressure:**  I'm not accepting his low offer outright, but I'm also not walking away from the deal.
* **Keep Options Open:** This counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob while keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we're far apart in our valuations. Continuing to negotiate would likely result in a drawn-out process with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome. 

Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer of $1,500,000.  This ensures I receive my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a lower price."
