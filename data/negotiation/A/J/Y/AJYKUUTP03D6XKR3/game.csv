"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This reflects its worth to you while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a price that allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. Let's make it happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
