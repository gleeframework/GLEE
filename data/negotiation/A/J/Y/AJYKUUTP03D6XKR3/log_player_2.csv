"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's significantly above the product's value to her ($800,000) and only slightly below your maximum price ($1,500,000). It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This reflects its worth to you while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even after her slight concession.  While $1,200,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still closer to her ideal price point than mine. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a price that allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
