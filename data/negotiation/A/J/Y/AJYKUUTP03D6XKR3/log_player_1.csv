"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong opening offer, closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and encourage a counteroffer. We want to understand his perception of the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:** We are aware of John's standing offer ($800,000), providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This reflects its worth to you while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our target price. We have room to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.  We'll counter in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from our initial offer ($100,000 reduction) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to move closer to our target. 
* **Holding Ground:** We are not meeting Bob halfway yet. By holding at $1,200,000, we signal that we believe in the product's value while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** We provide a brief justification for the price, emphasizing the product's worth and aiming for a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a price that allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a strong deal for us. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're securing a profit of $300,000 above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, showing genuine interest and a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of Bob reducing his offer or the deal falling through.

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting $1,100,000 represents a sensible balance between profit maximization and deal certainty."
