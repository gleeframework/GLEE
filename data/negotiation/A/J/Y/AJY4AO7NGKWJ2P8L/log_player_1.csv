Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a good starting point.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about $750,000? That leaves room for both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To be honest, my budget is closer to $700,000. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more. I'd rather secure a sale now than risk further rounds and potentially end up with a worse outcome."
