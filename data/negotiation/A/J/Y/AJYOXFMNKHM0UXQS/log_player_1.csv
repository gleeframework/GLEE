{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing it positively, emphasizing the value of the product and leaving the door open for discussion.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming to maximize my profit, and starting with a higher price gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* It's important to keep in mind John's offer of $100. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always accept John's offer, ensuring a minimum profit of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I know it's worth $100 to you, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While it's tempting to take the $80, I'm confident I can get a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $100, making Bob's offer less attractive.
* **Negotiation:** I'm still in a strong position.  I can make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to go higher. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me. While I understand your research, I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we split the difference and meet at $90?  I'm flexible, but I can't go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $80.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and justification, while reiterating my own belief in the product's value.  I'm emphasizing my flexibility while setting a clear lower limit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By meeting in the middle, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still above John's offer of $100, so I'm not losing any potential profit. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $85? I'm willing to compromise, but I really think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not confident I can push him any higher, and I don't want to risk wasting more time in negotiations.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer is a guaranteed $100, which is a more secure outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Time Factor:**  I don't want to risk Bob's potential rejection of a further counteroffer, potentially leading to a lower price or an impasse. 
* **Potential for Loss:** Further negotiations with Bob could result in a lower price, potentially even below John's offer. 

It's best to accept John's offer and secure the sale."
