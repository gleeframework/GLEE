"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $825,000? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
