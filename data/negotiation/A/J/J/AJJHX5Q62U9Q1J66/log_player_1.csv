""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to negotiate too aggressively.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, the aim is to maximize profit, so focusing on the higher potential offer from Bob is the primary strategy. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings from Bob while still ensuring a high likelihood of a sale."
