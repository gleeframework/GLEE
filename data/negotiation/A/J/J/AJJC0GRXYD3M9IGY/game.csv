"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to purchase if you accept.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll sell the product to you for $9750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
