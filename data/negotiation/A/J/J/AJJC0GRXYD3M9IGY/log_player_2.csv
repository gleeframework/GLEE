Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll sell the product to you for $9750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. While Alice has come down in price, it's still more than Bob's budget. He's already indicated his maximum price point, and further negotiation might not lead to a better outcome.  It's better to avoid further back and forth and secure the product from John at his desired price."
