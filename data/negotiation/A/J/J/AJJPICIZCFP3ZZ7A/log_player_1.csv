"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, we can always negotiate down.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I need to, so I have some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get $1,200,000 for the product, I believe it's worth more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing him I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping this will entice him to close the deal without going through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is a decent price, I'm still holding out for more. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point, and I still have the option to sell to John if negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a smaller drop from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my ideal, but still acknowledging his willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a higher price, $1,275,000 is a good deal. I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn.  I can always try to get a better price from other buyers in the future."
