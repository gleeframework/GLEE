"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential value of the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response and offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can bring significant value to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a good compromise. This offer is fair and allows for both of us to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
