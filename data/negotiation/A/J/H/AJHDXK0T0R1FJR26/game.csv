"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $135. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $145. It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
