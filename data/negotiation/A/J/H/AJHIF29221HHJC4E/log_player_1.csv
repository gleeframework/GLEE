Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially make more profit.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I'm asking for $13,000, I'm leaving the door open for a counteroffer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** I don't know much about Bob. If he's known to be a tough negotiator, I might want to start with a lower price.
* **My time:** I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, so I shouldn't spend too much time negotiating with Bob if it's not worth the effort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.  While I'd prefer more, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal entirely. 

* **Time:**  Negotiating further might take longer and I could risk Bob changing his mind.
* **Certainty:** Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at the minimum price I'm willing to accept.
* **John:** John's offer is the same as Bob's, so there's no advantage to selling to him instead."
