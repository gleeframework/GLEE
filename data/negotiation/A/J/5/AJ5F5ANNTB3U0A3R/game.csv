"I appreciate you offering the product, but $200 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80. This is my final offer.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm firm on my offer of $80. I've already found another seller willing to sell for that price, so unless you're willing to accept that, I'm going to buy from them.",80.0,Bob,4,
