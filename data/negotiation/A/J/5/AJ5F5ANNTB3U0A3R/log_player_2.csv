"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$200 is far too expensive.  It's more than double what I'm willing to pay.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you offering the product, but $200 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This offer stands as a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$140 is still too expensive for me. I'm not willing to pay more than $80, and John is ready to sell it to me at that price.  I'll counteroffer again, but if Alice rejects it I'm going to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm firm on my offer of $80. I've already found another seller willing to sell for that price, so unless you're willing to accept that, I'm going to buy from them."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
