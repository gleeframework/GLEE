"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're excited about this product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $105. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
