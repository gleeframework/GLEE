"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10200. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer: $10800. It's a good compromise, considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $10800, which would be $9400. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9400.0,Bob,6,
