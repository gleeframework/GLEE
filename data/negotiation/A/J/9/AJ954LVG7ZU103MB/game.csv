"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is too low.  Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is a fair price given the potential value of this product to your business.  Let's try $925,000. This gives us both a reasonable profit.",925000.0,Alice,5,
