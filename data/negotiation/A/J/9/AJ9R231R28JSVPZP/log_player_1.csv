Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the value to Bob and leaving the door open for discussion.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** The starting price is close to my minimum value, allowing for potential profit.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By offering a discount and being open to discussion, I'm encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Maintain a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not pressured into making a deal that's unfavorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're putting on this product, I'm only able to go up to $8500 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price through negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my $9,500 initial offer. I might try something like:

""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That way, we both get a good deal."""

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to my minimum value of $10,000 than his previous offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It allows me to get a reasonable price for the product while also avoiding the risk of losing the sale to John."
