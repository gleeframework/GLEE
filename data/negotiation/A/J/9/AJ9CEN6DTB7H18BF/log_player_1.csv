Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to make a deal. How about we settle on $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Testing the waters:** Starting at $1,800,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  His reaction will give you valuable information for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value justifies the high price without explicitly stating it. 

**Important Note:**  This is a bold opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it. You can always decrease your price, but you can't increase it once an offer is made."
