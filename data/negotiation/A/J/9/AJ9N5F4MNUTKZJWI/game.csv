"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 5-year warranty. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
