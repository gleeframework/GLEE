Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation and gives me room to maneuver.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,500,000 is my ideal price, I'm prepared to negotiate.  The difference between this price and the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John gives me flexibility.
* **Unknown Value:**  I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so starting high allows me to gauge his interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $750,000 is significantly less than my desired price, and even below the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob, so rejecting his offer gives me the chance to make a counteroffer.
* **Strategic Play:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate for a deal and that I value the product highly.  This may lead to a more favorable counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a significant portion of my desired value.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** This price is attractive because it's more than Bob's offer but less than my initial offer, potentially making it a more appealing compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** This price remains above the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, ensuring that even if Bob rejects this offer, I still have a viable backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to John's Price:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is only $100,000 higher than what John is offering.
* **No Significant Gain:** At this point, further negotiation with Bob might lead to a higher price, but it's unlikely to be significantly greater than what John is offering.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a safe and predictable outcome.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price or a failed negotiation."
