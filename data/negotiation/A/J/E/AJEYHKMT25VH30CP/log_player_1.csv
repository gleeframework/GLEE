"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer. My goal is to gauge his interest and see how far he's willing to go. I'm also setting the stage for a potential negotiation that could lead to a profitable deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to settle yet, as I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000. This is still above Bob's last offer but shows I'm willing to be flexible. I believe this price is reasonable considering the product's worth to me and Bob's potential profit margin. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still lower than my minimum threshold, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to hold out for a bit longer and see if we can reach a deal that's more profitable for me. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $1,000,000, which is my minimum threshold. This is a fair price that allows me to meet my goal and gives Bob a good opportunity to profit from the product. I'm confident he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob.  While $975,000 is tempting, I'm confident in my ability to get my minimum asking price of $1,000,000 from John.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee I meet my financial goal."
