Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  This product is valuable, but not at that price point. Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be frank, $1,200,000 is the lowest I can go for this product. It reflects the true value and the significant benefits it offers. Let me know if this works for you, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her absolute lowest price is $1,200,000. This is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, especially since she mentioned other interested buyers.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving you a significant amount."
