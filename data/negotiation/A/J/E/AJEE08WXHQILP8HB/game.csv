"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  This product is valuable, but not at that price point. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but we're still quite far apart on price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This is a strong offer, reflecting the product's value while staying within my budget. ",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be frank, $1,200,000 is the lowest I can go for this product. It reflects the true value and the significant benefits it offers. Let me know if this works for you, as I do have other interested buyers.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
