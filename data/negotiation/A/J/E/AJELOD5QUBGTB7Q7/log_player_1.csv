While $115 is tempting, I still think there's room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $120? That's my final offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I really think $115 is the best price for both of us. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly set on $115 and unlikely to budge. Taking the $115 is better than risking him walking away and getting only $100 from John."
