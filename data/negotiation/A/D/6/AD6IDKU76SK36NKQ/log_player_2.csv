# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you be willing to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I really need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

At $137.50, the product is still within my budget and represents a decent saving compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise considering Alice's need for profit."
