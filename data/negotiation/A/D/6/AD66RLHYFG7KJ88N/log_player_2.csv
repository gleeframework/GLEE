"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $20 from Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it leaves room for potential negotiation in the following rounds.  While I could offer a lower price, I want to make sure Alice doesn't immediately reject the offer and end the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I have several rounds left and there's still potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within my desired price range. I'm hoping Alice will recognize that I'm serious about purchasing the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still too high. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. With several rounds remaining, I'm willing to hold out for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal.  This offer is closer to her last offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to her price point.  If she rejects this, we're at a critical point where I may consider buying from John to avoid running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and quite close to my desired price.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking that she'll raise her price again or that I'll run out of time.  Accepting this offer secures the product for me at a reasonable price."
