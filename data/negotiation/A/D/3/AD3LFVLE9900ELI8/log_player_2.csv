"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get it sold, but I still need to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price.  By rejecting her offer, you might prompt her to come back with a lower price closer to her $8,000 value. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $12,000."
