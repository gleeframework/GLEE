"I understand your position, Bob, but $9,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I want to make a deal. How about this: $9,800, and we close this out today? This offer reflects my desire to move forward, but  also recognizes the value this product brings.",9800.0,Alice,5,
