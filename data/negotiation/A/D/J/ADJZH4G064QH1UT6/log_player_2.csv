"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's likely that further negotiation might only result in small concessions from Alice.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John."
