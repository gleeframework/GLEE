"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I believe this is a valuable asset that can greatly benefit you. To start negotiations, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** My opening offer acknowledges that I'm open to negotiation while still aiming for a price that is very beneficial to me. 
* **10 Rounds:**  With 10 rounds available, there's ample opportunity to adjust my offer based on Bob's responses and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** I'm aware that I have a guaranteed offer from John, which gives me leverage. I don't need to settle for a price significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your proposal. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay up to $1,400,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This suggests there's room for further negotiation.  I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to explore if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still quite a bit below my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,525,000."",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession by dropping $75,000 from my initial price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Holding Ground:** My new price of $1,525,000 is still comfortably above both my minimum and Bob's offer.  
* **Encouraging Movement:** By making a sizable move, I'm hoping Bob will reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to consider $1,500,000 as a potential price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating his seriousness about the deal.
* **Time Value:** While I have more rounds to negotiate, securing a deal now eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or my position weakening. 

Accepting $1,500,000 at this point represents a successful negotiation outcome."
