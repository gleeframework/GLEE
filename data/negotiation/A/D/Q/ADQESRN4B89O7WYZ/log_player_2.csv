"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product for as much as possible above its value to her ($100).
* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $150, but saving money is the goal.
* **John's Offer:**  John acts as your price ceiling. You know you can get the product for $150, so there's no need to pay more.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower offer closer to your limit or her minimum acceptable price."
