Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it leaves some room for negotiation. However, it's also significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), making it a tempting offer for him. 

By setting the price at $12,000, I'm aiming to maximize my potential earnings. If Bob accepts, I'll earn a good profit. If he rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $8,000, which is my fallback option."
