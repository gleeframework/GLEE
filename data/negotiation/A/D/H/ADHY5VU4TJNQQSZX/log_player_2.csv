"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum price, leaving room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $800,000, but that's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential savings it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $750000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and the potential savings it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  $750,000 is a reasonable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a lower price and potentially starting a bidding war.  Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a significant discount compared to John's offer."
