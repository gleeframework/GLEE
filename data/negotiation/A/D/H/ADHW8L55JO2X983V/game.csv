"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I can do $1,600,000, which is still a great value for this amazing product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
