"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer again and potentially ending up buying from John at $12,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget."
