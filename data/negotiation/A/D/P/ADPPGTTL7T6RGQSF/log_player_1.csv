Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob ($120), leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while still keeping the deal attractive for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115, considering your interest. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with $115. It's a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. This keeps the negotiation going and hopefully leads to a deal closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $120.  At this point, I'm confident that John is a safer bet. Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is my minimum threshold, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
