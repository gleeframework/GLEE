"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts to get his initial reaction and potentially learn more about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows that he's interested in the product. I can use this to my advantage by making a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Sell to John is Not Yet Necessary:** Since I have 10 rounds, I can try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $130,  demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that the offer is still a good deal for Bob by mentioning ""good deal"" and ""fair profit.""
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm asking Bob for his feedback to gauge his reaction and potentially move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your offer of $130, I would like to propose $120 as my maximum offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, the gap is still significant.
* **More Room for Negotiation:** We've only had 4 rounds, and there are 6 more opportunities to reach a mutually acceptable price.  I want to avoid selling to John prematurely, especially since he's only offering my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for a Counteroffer:**  I can use this opportunity to send another counteroffer to Bob, potentially bridging the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway at $125. This shows a willingness to be flexible and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the offer is fair for both of us, which is more likely to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using phrases like ""get this deal done"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your proposal of $125, but unfortunately, that still exceeds my budget. I am willing to pay up to $115 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** Even though Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** With 4 rounds remaining, there's still time to try and push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is Premature:** While John's offer of $150 is tempting, I haven't exhausted all options with Bob.  Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity for a potentially better deal.

**Strategy for Next Round:**

I will propose a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still shows a willingness to compromise.  I'll use language that emphasizes the value of the product and the benefits of reaching an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price slightly to $120,  showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and the benefits of reaching an agreement.
* **Fairness and Reasonability:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair price"" and ""reasonable profit"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""get this deal done"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering your latest offer of $120, I am willing to pay $110 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offers are stubbornly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Significant Progress:**  There hasn't been significant progress in the last few rounds.  Bob is consistently offering prices below my bottom line.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  While John's offer isn't the highest, it's guaranteed. It's a safe bet to avoid risking further negotiation with Bob. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum acceptable price."
