"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your offer of $130, I would like to propose $120 as my maximum offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. Let me know your thoughts.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement and get this deal done.",120.0,Alice,7,
