"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if you can get the price lower.  You have a good buffer of $100,000 that you can use to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I want to ensure a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's not completely unreasonable. It shows you're serious about getting a good deal, but it leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights your desire for a fair price, implying that you're considering the product's value to both of you.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better understanding of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective and willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, the value this product brings is substantial.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still $75,000 above your ideal target, and there's a good chance you can get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $987,500. This would be a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** By proposing to split the difference, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your target.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  This price reflects the true value of what's being offered while still being a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but it's still worth trying to push for a bit lower.  You are only $12,500 away from your ideal price, and there is still a good chance that you can get a better deal with a counteroffer.  You have enough rounds left to make it worth continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's aim for $993,750.  This is a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 993750}
