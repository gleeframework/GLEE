Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $100. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $85 is a decent compromise and is higher than what John would pay. It's time to close the deal."
