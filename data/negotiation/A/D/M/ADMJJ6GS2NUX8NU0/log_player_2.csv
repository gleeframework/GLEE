"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $145 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $110, we're aiming slightly below Alice's value for the product ($120). This leaves room for negotiation but still offers a price that would be very beneficial for us.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed in a way that's not confrontational and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $130 is a better price, it's still above Alice's value for the product.  We might be able to push Alice a little further down.
* **Alternative is Acceptable:** Buying from John at $150 is still an option, so we're not desperate to accept any price Alice offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It's getting closer, Alice.  I appreciate you working with me. How about $120?  That's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($110) and Alice's current price ($130).
* **Highlighting Fairness:** By pointing out that $120 is a fair deal, we're subtly reminding Alice that this is her break-even point.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The tone remains respectful and collaborative to foster a positive negotiation environment."
