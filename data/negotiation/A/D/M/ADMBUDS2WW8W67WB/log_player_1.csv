"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my minimum acceptable price, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm confident that John will buy it for $15,000, so I have a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm confident that John will buy it for $15,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'm going to counteroffer again hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a decent profit.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal.  I'm also hoping that this counteroffer will convince Bob that I'm serious about selling, and he might be more willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm determined to get a good price and that he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This is a significant drop from my previous offers, but I'm still making a decent profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept my offer.  If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
