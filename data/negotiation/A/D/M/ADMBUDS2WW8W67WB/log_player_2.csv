**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is still above my target price of $8,000, it's within my budget, and it seems like Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  It's worth taking this offer and closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation rounds.  It's also better than buying from John, saving me $2,500."
