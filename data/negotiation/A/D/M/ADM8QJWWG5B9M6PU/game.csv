"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  That's still a great value for you, and it gives us a solid starting point for a deal.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, but $1,150,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,200,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
