"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a bad deal for Bob to accept Alice's offer at $1,400,000. Bob should reject and counteroffer, aiming for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  That's still a great value for you, and it gives us a solid starting point for a deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to Bob's target, he can still aim for a lower price. There are still rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but $1,150,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,200,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's the same price as buying from John, and it's the best deal Bob is likely to get from Alice.  There's no guarantee Alice will continue lowering her price, and Bob is risking losing the deal altogether."
