"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since my maximum budget is $120, and John is offering the product at that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no reason to negotiate with Alice when I can secure the product immediately."
