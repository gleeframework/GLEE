"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $80 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for such a fantastic product. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's meet in the middle, and we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
