"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $6,000 is a good price, it's worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price even lower.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  $5,000 is a reasonable starting point, and it's still below my maximum budget.  If Alice rejects this, it gives me a chance to see how flexible she is and adjust my subsequent offers accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $5,500, which is a decent price and within my budget.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll budge further.  Accepting this offer saves time and ensures I get the product at a good price."
