"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired profit margin.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $13,750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250. This is a fair compromise that respects both our desired outcomes.",13250.0,Bob,4,

This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
