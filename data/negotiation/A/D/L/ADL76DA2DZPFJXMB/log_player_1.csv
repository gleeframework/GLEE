Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a more reasonable price. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is below its true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, $900,000 is a strong profit above my minimum. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing."
