Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I consider other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a strong offer near Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) aims to capture a significant portion of the potential surplus.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and scarcity, justifying the high price.
* **Time Pressure:** Introducing a limited-time offer creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly.
* **Alternative Option (Implicit):** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" the offer subtly implies that Alice has other options if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, Alice can still negotiate down, knowing her minimum acceptable price is $800,000."
