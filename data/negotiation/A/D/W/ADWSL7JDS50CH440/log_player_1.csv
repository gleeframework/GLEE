Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I'm happy to consider a counter-offer if you have one."",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations slightly above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offer:** Encouraging Bob to make a counter-offer keeps the dialogue open and allows you to gauge his interest level. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, a price too close to $150 might make Bob immediately lose interest.  $135 gives him a potential discount while still netting you a good profit."
