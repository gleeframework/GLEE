Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $145. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $140, and you have a guaranteed option for $120 with John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
