"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $175 is far above your maximum budget of $80. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only offer $80 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125? It's still a great price for the quality of this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $80.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, as you can always buy from John for $80 if you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the absolute maximum I can pay."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $100 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. That's a fair price for a product that's worth so much more.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is closer to your budget. However, it's still above your maximum of $80. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, it's best to take that option and avoid further negotiation."
