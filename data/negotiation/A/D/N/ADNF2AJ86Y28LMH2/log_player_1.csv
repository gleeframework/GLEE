Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but also making it clear that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to negotiate. I believe this is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000.  This is a safe and guaranteed deal, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, as the potential for getting a better price than this isn't high enough to warrant the risk."
