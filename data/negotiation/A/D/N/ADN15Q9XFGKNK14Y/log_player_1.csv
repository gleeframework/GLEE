Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point, and I'll adjust based on Bob's response.  I'm aiming for a high initial price to see if there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer to show I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still confident the product is worth more to Bob than $1,200,000, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum and a significant improvement over his initial offer. It's also a good amount more than John's offer, so it makes sense to accept this offer and finalize the deal."
