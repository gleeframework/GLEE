Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. It shows you're serious about this. However, my initial price reflects the true value of this product, which has the potential to significantly impact your bottom line.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial investment for both of us, but I believe the return will be more than worth it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, $1,100,000 is a significant jump from your initial offer, and it demonstrates your commitment.  However, we both know this product offers a unique value proposition that goes beyond standard market pricing. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to accept $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true worth of what's being offered.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I've been flexible so far because I believe in this product's value for you.  To be completely transparent, I have other opportunities I need to consider if we can't find an agreement soon.  I'm willing to make one last move at $1,450,000. This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I'll need to explore those other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing she's unlikely to go much lower. Her latest offer is still significantly above your $800,000 limit. Waiting introduces risk, as she might follow through with exploring other options.  John's offer provides certainty at your target price."
