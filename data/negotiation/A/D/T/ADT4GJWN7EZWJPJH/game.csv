"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a significant sum, the value this product holds goes beyond that. I could consider letting it go for $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes its value and allows us both to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
