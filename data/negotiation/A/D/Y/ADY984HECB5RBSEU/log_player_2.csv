"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice is asking for $120. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds to work with, so it's worth trying to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is lower:** I've dropped the price by $15, showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Reasoning is provided:** The message explains my position and shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Opportunity for agreement:**  This counteroffer is still above Alice's minimum value ($100), so there's a chance she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but lower than my starting point. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction:**  Her offer is lower than her initial offer, but it's still higher than my desired price.
* **More negotiation is possible:**  We still have several rounds left, so I'm willing to try for a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't get a better deal with Alice, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $108. This is a fair compromise that's closer to our target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Counteroffer:** I've only lowered the price by $2 from Alice's offer, showing her that I'm willing to be reasonable.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message highlights the ""fair compromise"" aspect, suggesting that both parties are moving towards a meeting point.
* **Keep the Pressure On:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $107 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise considering its value to you. I hope you'll find it acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is close to my target:** Her offer of $107 is only $7 above my desired price of $100.
* **Risking further negotiation:**  While I could try for a lower price, I've already had several rounds of back-and-forth. There's a chance that Alice might become less flexible or I might not be able to get a better deal.
* **Avoiding John's higher price:**  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product for a lower price than John's $150.

It's a good idea to accept Alice's offer and secure a good deal while minimizing risk."
