"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000, it's still above your ideal price point of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $13,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still above Alice's minimum value of $12,000. This gives Alice a chance to make a compromise while still leaving me some room to bargain if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still higher than my ideal price. It's also lower than the price from John, making it the best option for me right now.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
