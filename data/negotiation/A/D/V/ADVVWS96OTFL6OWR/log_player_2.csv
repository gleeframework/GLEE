"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money, and while Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He will continue negotiating to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $825,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount if you're willing to pay the full $850,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, even with the 1% discount. At this point, Bob has several rounds left, but the negotiations are becoming more difficult.  He's already made several counteroffers, and Alice's concession is minimal.  Rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially losing out on the deal, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring a successful purchase within his budget."
