"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
