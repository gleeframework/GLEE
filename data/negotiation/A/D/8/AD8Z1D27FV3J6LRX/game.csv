"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be open to $700,000?  I feel that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $700,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
