"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
