"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm asking for $1200000, a price that reflects its value and potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  It's truly unique and has the potential for significant returns.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?  This price acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. I believe this price reflects the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit below what I need to consider.  However, I'm open to finding a solution that benefits both of us.  Would you be willing to go up to $1000000? This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for some flexibility on both sides. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $990000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price is a reflection of the value we've both identified in this product, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $980000, which is a small concession from my previous offer. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget.",980000.0,Bob,8,
