```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to earn closer to $1 million, Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly better than John's offer.  We only have two rounds left, and there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that I'll be forced to sell to John.  It's time to accept a good deal and close this negotiation."
