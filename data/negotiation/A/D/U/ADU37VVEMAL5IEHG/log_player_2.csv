"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I understand it might seem quite an investment. However, I am confident it will pay off in the long run. Considering the exceptional quality and benefits it offers, I am offering this opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This price is significantly lower than the market value and represents an excellent opportunity for you to secure such a valuable asset at a favorable rate. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details about the product. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $14,000. While this is a good deal, you can get it for $15,000 from John if you reject Alice's offer. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $15,000."
