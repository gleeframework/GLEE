"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be really valuable for your business too. I'm offering it to you for $9,500, which is a great starting point for negotiation. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $8,800? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with $8,800. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $8,600 is my final offer. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",8600.0,Alice,5,
