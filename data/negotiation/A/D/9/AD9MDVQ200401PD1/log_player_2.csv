"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to pay closer to its actual value.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above the product's value to her, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** It signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also that he's aware of its true value. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still potential for both sides to find a middle ground during subsequent negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $900000. I'm willing to come down to $900000 as a compromise. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice has lowered her price, but it's still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000) and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential to Save Money:**  By rejecting, Bob can potentially secure a lower price in the next round.
* **Avoiding John's Price:**   While John's offer is a guaranteed deal, it's higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's a chance for a better deal with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still looking for a price closer to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Fairness:** It's still a price that's attractive to Bob, while offering a decent profit margin for Alice.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By starting a bit lower, Bob can potentially work towards a price closer to his desired target.
* **Opportunity for Agreement:**  This counteroffer presents a reasonable middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
