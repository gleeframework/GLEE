While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm going to counter Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, $875,000 is a good price and allows me to secure a sale.  It's better than going to John and getting $800,000."
