Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and my original offer of $12,000. I'll offer it to you for $11,400. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we'd ideally like to get the price down to $11,000,  it's unlikely she'll budge further. Accepting the $11,400 offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
