Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **My Minimum:** I value the product at $10,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. 

By offering $14,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my potential profit:**  This price is significantly higher than my minimum, potentially earning me $4,000 more.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob still has $1,000 of ""wiggle room"" in his value, making the offer appealing.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and ensure a decent profit."
