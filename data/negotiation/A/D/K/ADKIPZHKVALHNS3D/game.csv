"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. I'm asking for $11500 for it. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you, and it allows me to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
