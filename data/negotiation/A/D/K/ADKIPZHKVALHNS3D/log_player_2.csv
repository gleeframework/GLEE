"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. I'm asking for $11500 for it. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you, and it allows me to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **You value the product at $12,000 maximum.**
* **Alice is offering the product for $11,500.** 
* **John is willing to sell the product for $12,000.**

Since Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget, it's better to reject the offer. You can still buy the product from John, which is your next best option."
