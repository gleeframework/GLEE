"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
