"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $95 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $110. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet at $110. I would like to make one last offer of $100, which I believe is a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",100.0,Bob,4,,
