"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a more reasonable price for a product of this value.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
