I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. It also signals to Bob that I value the product highly and am not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,900,000. It's a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's last offer."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
