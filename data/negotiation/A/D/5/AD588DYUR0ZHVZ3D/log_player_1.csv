Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.
