"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
