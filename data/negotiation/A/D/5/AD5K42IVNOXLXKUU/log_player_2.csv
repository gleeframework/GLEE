Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to your portfolio. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,500,000.** 
* **There are still 9 rounds left.**  This gives you room to negotiate and try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is currently worse than rejecting Alice's offer.** You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I believe my initial offer is closer to the true worth of this product considering its potential.  Could we consider a price of $1,350,000? I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, it's still outside my budget.

Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
