"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial parameters.  I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I believe my initial offer is closer to the true worth of this product considering its potential.  Could we consider a price of $1,350,000? I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, it's still outside my budget.  To demonstrate my serious interest, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
