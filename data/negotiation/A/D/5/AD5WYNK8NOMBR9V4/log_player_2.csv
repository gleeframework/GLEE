"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to pressure me by mentioning another buyer and inflating the price. I know I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so I'll reject her offer and see if she counters with a lower price."
