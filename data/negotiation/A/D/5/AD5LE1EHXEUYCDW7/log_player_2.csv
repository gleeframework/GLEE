"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.**  
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.** 
* **Buying from John is not ideal at this point as Alice might be willing to negotiate lower.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I think that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $115 is within your budget of $150.**
* **This is a good compromise and allows you to buy the product without going over your limit.**
* **Continuing to negotiate could lead to more back and forth, and you risk Alice rejecting further offers or you losing the opportunity to buy from her altogether.**"
