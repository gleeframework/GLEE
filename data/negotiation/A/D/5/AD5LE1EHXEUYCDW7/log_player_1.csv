Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value of $100 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets the tone for a potential ""fair"" negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I think that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
