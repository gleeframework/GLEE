"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's less than half of my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is still well above my minimum value, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's also a significant drop from my initial offer, which should signal to Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject it and continue to try to get a better price.  However, I'm starting to run out of time, and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a price I'm happy with.  I'm going to keep a close eye on the offers and be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $900,000. This is still a substantial amount, but I'm hoping that showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise will convince Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer. I'm also getting closer to John's offer, which I'm keeping in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try one more time to see if I can get him to go higher.  However, I'm starting to feel the pressure. If this round doesn't work out, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm meeting Bob halfway, but I'm not going any lower. I'm hoping that he'll realize that this is a fair price and accept it. If he doesn't, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
