"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was wondering if you could lower the price a bit. I think $110 would be more within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While his offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe I can only commit to $115 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we are already in round 4.  If I reject his offer, there's no guarantee that he'll come up with a higher offer in the next round, and I risk ending up with only $100 from John. It's best to accept this offer and secure a sale."
