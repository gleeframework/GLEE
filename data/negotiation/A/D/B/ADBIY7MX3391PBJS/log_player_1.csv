Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  While my absolute minimum price is confidential, to make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting near your minimum ($1,200,000) but below it signals seriousness while leaving room for negotiation if Bob pushes back.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the product's worth to Bob specifically aims to make the price more palatable. 
* **Urgency and Benefit:** Suggesting a quick deal with ""confidential"" minimum price might incentivize Bob to act without prolonged haggling."
