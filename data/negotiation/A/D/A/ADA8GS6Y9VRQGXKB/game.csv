"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $14000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer it to you for $16500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",16500.0,Alice,5,
