# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get to a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  You can buy from John for $800,000, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
