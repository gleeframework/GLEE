After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get to a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
