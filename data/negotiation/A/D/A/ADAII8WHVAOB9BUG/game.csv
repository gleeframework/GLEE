"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's meet in the middle!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While I recognize the value you place on this product, $1,050,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it also ensures I can still achieve my desired outcome. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,075,000. I'll offer $1,062,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1062500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there with your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,065,000.  This is a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1065000.0,Alice,7,
