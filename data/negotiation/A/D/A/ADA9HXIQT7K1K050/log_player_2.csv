Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm going to start low and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and hopefully, it's a starting point we can work with."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I've already made several counteroffers, and there's no guarantee she'll come down further. To avoid risking the deal completely, I'll purchase the product from John at my maximum budget."
