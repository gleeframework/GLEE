"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $90 is a good price, but I can potentially get it for even less. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to secure a good deal.  This price is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $85, which is within my price range and a decent compromise.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and the time constraint of 10 rounds makes accepting her offer the most logical choice."
