# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount of money.  I'm not at liberty to disclose the specifics of the product just yet, but I can assure you it holds immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.  This is a price point I believe reflects the true worth of the product.  Consider this a chance to acquire something truly valuable. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $200,000 less than what you'd pay John.  Even though you don't know the product's true value, it's in your best interest to accept the lower offer and save money."
