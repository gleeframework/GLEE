"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it still represents a good value for you. Let me know if you're open to this.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10000.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
