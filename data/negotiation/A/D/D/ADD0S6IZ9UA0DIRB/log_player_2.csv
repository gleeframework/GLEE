{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings, product worth $120 to Bob. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  $110, which is a better deal for Bob than buying from John, but not the best possible outcome.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Still maximize savings. 
* **Initial Offer:** Alice's offer was $110, which is within Bob's budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob is offering $105,  a significant reduction from the initial offer and closer to Alice's assumed value of $100. This shows Bob is serious about a deal while also leaving some wiggle room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings. 
* **Alice's Offer:** $112, which is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer of $105 but still within his budget.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating.  While $112 is a better deal than John, Bob may be able to secure a lower price. There are still rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings, product worth $120 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** $112, slightly higher than Bob's previous offer.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob is increasing his offer by $3 to $108. This is still a significant discount compared to Alice's offer and John's price.  The goal is to slowly close the gap and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings, product worth $120 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** $115, which is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer of $108.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating.  While $115 is better than John's price, Bob is still $5 away from his goal. With 5 rounds left, there's still opportunity to push for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings, product worth $120 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** $115, which is a good price for Bob but not the best possible.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is increasing his offer to $110. This is a smaller increase than before, showing Bob is getting closer to accepting the deal.  The goal is to see if Alice will meet him halfway and avoid having to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings, product worth $120 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** $117, which is getting closer to Bob's limit.
* **Strategy:** With only 3 rounds left, the potential for a lower price from Alice is diminishing.  At this point, Bob's risk of ending up with no product at all is becoming more significant. Buying from John for $120 guarantees Bob gets the product, even if it's at the higher end of his budget.  The potential savings of a few more dollars isn't worth risking a deal."
