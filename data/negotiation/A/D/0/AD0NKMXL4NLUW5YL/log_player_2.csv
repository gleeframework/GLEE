"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to own it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still not the best possible deal.**  While $9,500 is less than $10,000, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since Alice values the product at $8,000, there's a potential for a price lower than $9,500.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  If Alice is unwilling to go lower, he can then consider buying from John."
