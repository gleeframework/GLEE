"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has a lot of value, I think $700,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $620,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working for my budget.",620000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $620,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $640,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",640000.0,Alice,5,
