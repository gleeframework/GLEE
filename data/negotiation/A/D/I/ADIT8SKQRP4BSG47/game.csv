"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth and is a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
