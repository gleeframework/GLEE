"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $800000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1200000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $800000.
