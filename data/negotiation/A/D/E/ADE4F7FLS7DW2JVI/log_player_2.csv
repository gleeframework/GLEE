Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that will surely bring value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,800. This is still a great deal, considering the product's worth $12,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is within my budget and a good deal considering the product's worth to me.  It's also significantly lower than John's price, so it's the best option at this point."
