Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.  I'm not willing to pay more than $1,300,000 and I can always buy from John if this doesn't work out.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
