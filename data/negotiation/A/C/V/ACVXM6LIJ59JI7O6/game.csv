"Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I'm not going to go any higher.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While that's a significant gap from my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down a bit to show I'm serious about finding a fair deal. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference and meet at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. How about $1,450,000?  This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but it's still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
