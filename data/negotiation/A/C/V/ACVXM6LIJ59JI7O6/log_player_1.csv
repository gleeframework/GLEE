Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I'm not going to go any higher.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While that's a significant gap from my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down a bit to show I'm serious about finding a fair deal. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference and meet at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price. Accepting $1,300,000 would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  It's worth risking another round of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. How about $1,450,000?  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but it's still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'm going to have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. While I could try another round of negotiation, it's risky. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to potentially get stuck with a worse deal from Bob."
