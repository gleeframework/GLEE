Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $10,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something special."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential bargaining and makes it more likely to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will reveal how interested he is and provide insight into his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you won't be forced to go below your minimum acceptable price."
