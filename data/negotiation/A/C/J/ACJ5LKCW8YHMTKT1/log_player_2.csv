I'll make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point. Accepting at $1,120,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
