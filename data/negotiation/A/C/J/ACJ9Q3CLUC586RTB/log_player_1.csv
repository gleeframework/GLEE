"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This creates room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is a better offer than Bob's initial $100 valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $108 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $109 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $109 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will offer a price that meets my minimum. Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I achieve my minimum profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
