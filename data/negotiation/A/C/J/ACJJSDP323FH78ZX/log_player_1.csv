"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at such a low price. 
* **Keeping options open:** By rejecting, I maintain the option of making a counteroffer and potentially closing the deal at a more favorable price.  I also keep the option of selling to John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for you, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's work towards finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain value:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate, but I'm still above Bob's offer, ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the value the product brings to Bob, emphasizing the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Openness to further discussion:**  The message ends with a call for finding a solution together, keeping the door open for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $950,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for higher offers:**  We've already established a negotiation range, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further rounds.
* **John remains a strong option:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000, which is my ideal outcome. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I show that I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's current offer. This maintains leverage and allows me to push for a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle, but strategically:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway in terms of the difference between our previous offers, but I'm still maintaining a price significantly above his latest offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not at the expense of my own interests. 
* **Emphasizing value and compromise:**  The message emphasizes the value the product offers while also highlighting the compromise I'm making on my side.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  The message ends with a call for finding a solution, keeping the negotiation open and positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding. I appreciate the movement you've made on the price. I'm willing to go up a bit, how about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not close enough:**  $975,000 is still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:** With only 4 rounds remaining, accepting this offer would likely result in a price that's much lower than I'd prefer.
* **John's offer remains attractive:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option and provides a guaranteed high price.
* **Continuing to push:**  I'll continue to counteroffer with the aim of getting closer to my desired price, while keeping John as a strong fallback option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your willingness to move up, $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,012,500.  This is a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle again:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also maintaining a price above his offer. 
* **Emphasizing the value and compromise:** The message highlights the value the product offers and the significant compromise I'm making.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  The message emphasizes working together to reach a deal, keeping the negotiation open and positive.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By making a counteroffer instead of accepting, I retain leverage and maintain the possibility of a higher price."
