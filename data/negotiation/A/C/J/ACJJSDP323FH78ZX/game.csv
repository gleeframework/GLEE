"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for you, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's work towards finding a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding. I appreciate the movement you've made on the price. I'm willing to go up a bit, how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your willingness to move up, $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,012,500.  This is a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
