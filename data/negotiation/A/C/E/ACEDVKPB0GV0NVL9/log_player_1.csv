Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $700,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to you while ensuring I can still achieve my goals. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
  
While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get a higher price. I'll counteroffer again and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm hearing you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's compromise at $800,000.  This price recognizes the value of the product for you while ensuring I meet my minimum.  Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
