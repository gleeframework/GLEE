Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and has even called her $14,500 offer her ""final offer.""  It's unlikely she'll go down significantly.  At this point, John's offer of $15,000 is the better deal. It saves you money and avoids the risk of further unsuccessful negotiation with Alice."
