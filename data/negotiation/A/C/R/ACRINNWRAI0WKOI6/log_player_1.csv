"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good middle ground between my minimum value of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $150. It gives Bob a good discount while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $150, and it's a better price than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $105 is a good compromise and much better than selling to John for $80.  There are only a few rounds left and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
