"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However,  $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be willing to pay for this product. I'm happy to continue the discussion, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is your maximum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
