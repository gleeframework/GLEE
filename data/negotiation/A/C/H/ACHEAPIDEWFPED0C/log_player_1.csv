Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However,  $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be willing to pay for this product. I'm happy to continue the discussion, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
