Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not giving the product away for less than $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $150, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It sets a clear price:** You're not being vague, you're establishing your starting point.

This offer allows for further negotiation and gives you a chance to gauge Bob's interest without immediately pushing him away with a too-high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to pay more than $80, so there's potential to get closer to your desired price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I can come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about $105?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $105 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could potentially continue to negotiate, $98 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John and is very close to your desired price. At this point, it's worth accepting the offer to avoid risking losing the deal entirely."
