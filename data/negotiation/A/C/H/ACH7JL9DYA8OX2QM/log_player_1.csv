{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your $10,000 minimum, meaning you'll still profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have space to lower the price slightly, but still get a good deal.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can see if Bob is willing to compromise. You can then adjust your strategy depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. It's worth risking a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm confident I can find a middle ground that works for both of us."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Would you consider $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from the price I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, so how about $8,750? Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, and I'm not willing to sell for anything less than my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $8,750 is still below my minimum for this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one final offer: $8,750 is still too high for me. How about $8,500, but I'll throw in a small favor for you - I'll give you a good review on a platform that a lot of your customers use. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I appreciate Bob's attempt to sweeten the deal with a review,  $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum price.  I'm not willing to compromise any further, and I'm confident that John will be happy to pay my asking price."
