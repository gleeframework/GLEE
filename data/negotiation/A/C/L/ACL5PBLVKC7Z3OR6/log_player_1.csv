Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the current market."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value, but not excessively so. This creates an opportunity for negotiation while still aiming for a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Justified Price:**  The message includes a brief justification for the price, adding a sense of value and reason to the offer.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for this product.  I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have the leverage of John's offer, so it's worth negotiating further to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and agree on $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Firmness:**  The message starts by acknowledging Bob's position but firmly stating that his offer is too low.
* **Justification:** Referencing ""market value"" adds weight to your counteroffer and positions the product's value beyond just your personal valuation.
* **Compromise:**  Meeting Bob halfway shows a willingness to negotiate, but also sets a clear boundary. The $1,100,000 price point aims to secure a price that benefits both parties while still remaining above your minimum.
* **Alternative:** Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet your price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,075,000.  This price is closer to what I can afford, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is inching up, but very slowly.  At this pace, it's unlikely you'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. The difference between Bob's current offer ($1,075,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000) is substantial enough to warrant ending negotiations with Bob. 

It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
