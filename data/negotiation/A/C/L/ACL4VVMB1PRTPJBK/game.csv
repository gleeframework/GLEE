"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I understand your position.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I'm really interested in this product and I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to move up.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",9500.0,Alice,5,
