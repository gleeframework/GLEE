Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  $900,000 is significantly below the product's value to me, and I'm confident I can get a better offer.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product.  How about $1,100,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm happy to close the deal now."
