"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to budge above his valuation of $80, which is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in wasting further rounds negotiating. Selling to John for $80 guarantees I get my minimum price without the risk of drawn-out negotiations."
