"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and ensures I get a good price. However, if Bob rejects, I'm prepared to consider counteroffers and make a new offer, while keeping the $1,000,000 John is offering as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter again in the next round. I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired price, but this offer is a more reasonable compromise given Bob's persistent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly stubborn. While I'd prefer to get a better price, it's becoming clear that we may not reach an agreement before the deadline.  To ensure I get at least my minimum desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
