Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  A 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial constraints. 
* If you learn more about Bob, you might adjust your offer accordingly."
