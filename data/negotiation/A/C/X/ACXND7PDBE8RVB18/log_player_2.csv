"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it's worth every penny of its $80 value to you. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $75 for the product. This is a fair deal considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, you can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer.  You're willing to pay up to $80, and Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount. However, $75 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $70 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 70}
