Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it's worth every penny of its $80 value to you. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $75 for the product. This is a fair deal considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can proceed with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount. However, $75 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $70 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
