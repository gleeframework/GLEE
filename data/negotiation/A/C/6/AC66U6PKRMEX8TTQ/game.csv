"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you and the market price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, but $14,000 is still pushing my budget.  I can go up to $12,000.  That's a fair offer considering John is offering the same product for $10,000.",12000.0,Bob,4,
