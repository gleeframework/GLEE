Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a good compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($150). It gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a decent price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price point. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $135. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my initial offer.  This should hopefully lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $132 is very close to my desired price point, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from him. Accepting his offer secures a sale at a price that's both profitable and fair."
