Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth at least $10,000, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe it's worth at least $10,000, you subtly anchor that price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room:** While you aim for $12,000, the ""willing to part"" phrasing implies there might be some flexibility if Bob negotiates.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above $10,000."
