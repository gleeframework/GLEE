Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal and incentivizes him to make a counteroffer.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Counteroffer is Necessary:**  I need to push back and try to get a better price.  A counteroffer gives me the chance to explore a middle ground.
* **John is a Secure Backup:**  I have John waiting in the wings for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,000 to make this deal work. Let's find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Stronger Position:**  $13,000 is still above Bob's offer but closer to my desired price point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The counteroffer leaves room for further discussion and a possible agreement. 
* **John is Still Available:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I can always go to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 was a bit too low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $15,000 and shows that he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and get a decent profit.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob could walk away completely.  Accepting his offer is a safer option."
