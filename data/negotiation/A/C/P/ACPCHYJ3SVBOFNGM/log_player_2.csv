"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's always a good idea to start negotiating by rejecting the initial offer. This shows Alice you're serious about getting a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation.  However,  $2,000,000 is closer to its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I can still get the product from John for a significantly lower price, so it's more beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 as my final offer. This price represents a significant compromise on my end while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like Alice is firm on her price. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiations."
