{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more to me than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but still below your minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while leaving you with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still closer to my desired price than selling to John. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a little too high for me. How about $108? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by pushing for more. Accepting his offer will give me a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for less."
