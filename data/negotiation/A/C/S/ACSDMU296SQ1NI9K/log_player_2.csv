"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* It's worth rejecting the offer and counter-offering to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* While Bob would prefer to pay less, it's a reasonable compromise, especially considering John is selling the same product for $15,000. 
* Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John."
