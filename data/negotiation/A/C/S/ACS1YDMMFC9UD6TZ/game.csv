"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind, and I know it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value it holds.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. This product offers unique advantages and potential that similar products on the market simply can't match. How about we meet in the middle, at $2,100,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $2,050,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
