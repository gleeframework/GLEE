"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1500000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, reflecting my genuine interest and a price that I believe is fair.  What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $750000 is below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $900000, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
