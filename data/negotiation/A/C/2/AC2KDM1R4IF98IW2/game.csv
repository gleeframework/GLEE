"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right at the midpoint between our starting points.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
