Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum price. This leaves room for bargaining if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and if he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
