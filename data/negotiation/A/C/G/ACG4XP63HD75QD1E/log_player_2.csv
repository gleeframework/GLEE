"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11500. It's a great price, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for Bob. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving Bob the opportunity to potentially get the price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11750. It's a great price, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's target was $10,000,  $11,750 is still a good deal for him. It's a better price than John's offer, and it's getting closer to Bob's ideal price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product without risking a higher price or losing the deal altogether."
