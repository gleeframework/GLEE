"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $100. Let's close this deal!",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $100. I think it's worth a bit more than that. How about we try $110? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
