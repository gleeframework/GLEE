"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product,  reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
