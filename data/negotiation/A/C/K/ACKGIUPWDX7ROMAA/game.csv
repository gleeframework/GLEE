"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already offered you a great deal with the extras, and you're still not willing to meet me at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1280000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other buyers.
