"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is pretty close to your maximum, but there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 feels a bit high for me. How about $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer a bit lower than what you're actually willing to pay. This leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  Jumping straight to a very low price (e.g., $80) might be seen as unreasonable and could discourage Alice from further negotiation. $105 is a decent drop from her offer but still within a potentially agreeable range.
* **Polite and Open:** The message aims to maintain a positive tone, showing you're still interested while clearly stating your price preference."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, I'm open to negotiating. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met you halfway between her initial offer and your counteroffer. This price of $110 is a good deal, saving you $10 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome, and continuing might risk losing the deal altogether."
