Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You are aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation while ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:** This price is well above your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob tries to negotiate, you have some space to potentially lower the price slightly and still make a good deal. 

This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
