Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I believe a price of $175 gives Bob some room to counteroffer while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low offer.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above my minimum acceptable value.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go much lower. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a chance to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's more profitable for me to sell to John.  This ensures I get at least my minimum desired profit."
