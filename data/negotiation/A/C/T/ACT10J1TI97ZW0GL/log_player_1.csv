Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob might incentivize him to accept the offer.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a backup to ensure we get our minimum price of $10,000."
