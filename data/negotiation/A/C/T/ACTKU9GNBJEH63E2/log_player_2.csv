"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While Alice is coming down, $13,500 is still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to come away happy."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the idea of finding a fair compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While Alice is getting closer, $13,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to continue negotiating to see if they can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're getting closer.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $12,500.  This is a fair price that is within my budget and still gives you a good profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,250. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has consistently been unwilling to go below $13,000, and Bob has already tried to meet her halfway, so there's a good chance she will continue to be stubborn. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, it's a better deal for Bob and he should take it.  There are only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile."
