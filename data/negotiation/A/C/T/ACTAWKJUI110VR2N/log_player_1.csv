Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell it for at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,200,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($700,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential gain. This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer rather than letting it go to John."
