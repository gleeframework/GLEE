This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my own valuation. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but also ensures I'm not immediately losing out on a substantial amount of money."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $850,000 is a significant amount of money, I am still holding out for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer."

While I'm getting closer to Bob's budget,  I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm going to counter with a final offer, and if he rejects, I'll sell to John."
