``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects it, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential for gain. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to be able to make a profit. Can you consider my offer?

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but closer to what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $775,000 is a step in the right direction.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $825,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I've been considering buying the product for from John. Can you accept this price?

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a higher price, it's better to secure the sale at this point.  Further negotiation might not yield a better outcome, and I risk losing the sale to John."
