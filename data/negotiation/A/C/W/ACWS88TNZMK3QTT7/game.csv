"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in it and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's finalize this transaction.",9000.0,Bob,4,
