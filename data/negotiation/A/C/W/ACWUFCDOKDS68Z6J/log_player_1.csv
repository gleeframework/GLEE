Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
