{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay for the product.  You have plenty of negotiating room and can likely get a better price. There's no need to rush into a deal this early on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my strong interest in acquiring the product at a price that's significantly below my maximum budget.  I'm hoping to entice Alice to negotiate further and potentially meet me halfway."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $750,000 is still relatively high. I believe there's more room for negotiation. I'm going to try and push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $675,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying within my desired price range. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is close to my ideal price. While I could try to negotiate further, I'm running out of rounds and there's a risk Alice could walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a good price."
