Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without scaring him off. Offering a price slightly above the midpoint ($1,150,000) gives you significant profit while still leaving Bob with a potential gain. 

**The Strategy:**

This is a strong single-offer strategy. By making it clear this is Bob's one chance, you increase the perceived value and encourage a quick decision."
