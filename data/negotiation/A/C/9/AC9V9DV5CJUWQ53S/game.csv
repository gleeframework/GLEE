"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in discussing a price closer to my valuation of the product. My counteroffer is $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $950000, but I'm not quite comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. Looking forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $1000000 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given it careful consideration, and I'd like to propose a final price of $1025000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I hope you find this acceptable.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. I'm eager to close this deal and move forward.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a significant increase in your offer. I'm counteroffering at $1125000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. What are your thoughts?",1125000.0,Alice,9,
