"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, at $200. This gives me a lot of room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still securing a profit well above my minimum.  I'm confident that I can close the deal within 10 rounds, but if Bob proves stubborn, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial target of $200.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm confident I can close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $180. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it still leaves room for negotiation while remaining above Bob's offer.  I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, as it is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more,  $170 is a good price and it's getting close to the end of our negotiations.  There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price if I keep negotiating, but it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
