"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above your ideal price point of $8,000.
* You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate further. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is very close to your ideal price of $9,000.
* You are already in round 3, and with only 7 rounds remaining, it's getting close to the point where the negotiation might drag on and you might not get a better deal. 
* While you could reject and counteroffer again, there's a chance Alice might not budge further, and you might end up having to buy from John at $12,000.

Accepting the offer ensures a good deal for you without risking a longer negotiation that might not yield better results."
