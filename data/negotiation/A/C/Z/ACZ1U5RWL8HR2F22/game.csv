"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $1,500,000 is outside my budget.

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for our premium product. This figure aims to strike a balance between the product's value and your budget constraints.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still slightly more than I can comfortably afford. To bridge the gap, I'd like to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting very close! I'm ready to finalize this deal, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
