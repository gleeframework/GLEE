Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price of $1,150,000 before I consider other offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but we also need to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it above that price is essential.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,150,000, there might be a slight possibility for Bob to negotiate a bit, but not lower than his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:**  The message subtly emphasizes that you have another buyer (John) lined up, which creates a sense of urgency and value."
