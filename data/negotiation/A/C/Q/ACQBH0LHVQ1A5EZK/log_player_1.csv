Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're still earning a profit, but you're also leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a friendly message:**  Establishing a positive tone from the start can help the negotiation go smoothly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer to try and get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $135?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally prefer $135, Bob's offer of $130 is still within my minimum acceptable price range of $150. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
