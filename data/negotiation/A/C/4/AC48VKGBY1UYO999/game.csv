"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. It's the highest I can go right now.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay. I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,000. It's the best I can do right now.",9000.0,Bob,6,
