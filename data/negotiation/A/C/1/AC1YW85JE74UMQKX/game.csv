"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
