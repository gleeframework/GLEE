Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $110 wouldn't cover my costs. How about $125? I'm willing to compromise a bit to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $117 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $121. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down to a price close to her value. While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's not worth the risk of her walking away or reaching a point where the potential savings are insignificant. $121 is a good deal."
