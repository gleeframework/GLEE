"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $110 wouldn't cover my costs. How about $125? I'm willing to compromise a bit to make this work.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have costs to cover, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $117?",117.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $117 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $121. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",121.0,Alice,5,
