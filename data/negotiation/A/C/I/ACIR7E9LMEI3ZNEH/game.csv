"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still not quite at a point where I can accept your offer. How about $1,050,000? This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's a great price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,
