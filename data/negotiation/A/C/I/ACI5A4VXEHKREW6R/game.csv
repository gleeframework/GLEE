"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This would still give you a great deal on the product, and it's fair for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
