"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9500. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
