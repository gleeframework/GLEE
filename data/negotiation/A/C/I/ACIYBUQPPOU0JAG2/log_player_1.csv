{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $150, but I'll be prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good price for you, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 110}
