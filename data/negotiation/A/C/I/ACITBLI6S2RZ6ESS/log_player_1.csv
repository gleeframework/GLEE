"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for you as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's close this deal quickly!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive by accepting this offer.
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept sooner rather than waiting for later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This is still a good deal for you as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While Bob's offer is above my minimum, there's still room to negotiate and get closer to my desired price.  
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to push for a better price in subsequent rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John now guarantees $800,000, but there's a potential for a significantly higher price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  With 8 rounds remaining, the risk of not securing a better deal is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  We're both trying to find a deal that works for us, and this price would still be a great deal for you given the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but not by too much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential profit he'll gain.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm using language like ""bridge the gap"" to create a sense of cooperation and increase the likelihood of reaching a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to compromise, I can't go above $950,000. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not securing a deal with Bob and being forced to sell to John at a lower price increases. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While I could potentially squeeze out a little more, accepting Bob's offer now secures a good deal and prevents further negotiation that might lead to a breakdown in the deal."
