Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for your product.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm also aware of the potential $800,000 offer from John, which gives me a good safety net.  I need to see if I can close the deal with Bob for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a certain budget, but $850,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
