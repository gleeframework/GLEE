"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum selling price and still leaves you room for profit.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000? This is still significantly lower than my initial asking price but allows for a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and $950,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still a bit off from my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This price would allow me to make this deal worthwhile while still giving you a significant discount. It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
