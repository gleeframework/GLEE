"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the product's value to you, I'd be willing to offer $1,250,000.  This price is still within my budget, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significant, and $1,250,000 doesn't fully reflect that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
