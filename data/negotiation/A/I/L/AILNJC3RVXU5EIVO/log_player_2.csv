"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you can get it from John for the same price. This means you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or simply buy from John without taking any risk."
