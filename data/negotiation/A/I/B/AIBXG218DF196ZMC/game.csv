"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $10000 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference, how about $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
