Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum price is $1,000,000. It's highly unlikely he'll go any higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes no financial sense to continue negotiating with Bob or accept his offer. Selling to John ensures you receive the product's minimum value to you."
