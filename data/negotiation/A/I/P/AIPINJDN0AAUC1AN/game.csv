"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $11,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,500. I'd like to propose a compromise - how about $11,000?
