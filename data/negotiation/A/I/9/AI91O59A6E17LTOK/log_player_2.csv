"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,200,000 to me. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

Round 7

# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is very slowly lowering her price. She's consistently aiming for a price above $1,000,000. At this rate, it's unlikely you'll negotiate her down enough within the remaining rounds to make it worth continuing the negotiation. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John with no further hassle."
