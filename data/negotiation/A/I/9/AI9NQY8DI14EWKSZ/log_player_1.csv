"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer. It's well above my minimum threshold, leaving room for negotiation, but it also reflects the value of the product to Bob. This should hopefully encourage him to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves me with a smaller profit margin. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob is showing interest in the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $975,000? It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $975,000 is still not enough. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I have a backup option with John. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $975,000 is still not quite meeting my needs.  Would you be willing to go up to $1,000,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
