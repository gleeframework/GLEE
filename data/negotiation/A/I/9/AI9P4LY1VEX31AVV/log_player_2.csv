I can throw in some extras that will make the product even more valuable to you. If you're willing to meet me at $13,000, I'll include these extras. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to move on to other interested buyers.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice has made it clear she won't budge from $13,000. While the extras might be tempting, they aren't worth going over your $8,000 limit, especially when you have a guaranteed option with John."
