"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price Alice, I appreciate it. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand this is your final offer, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, anything above $11,500 is pushing my budget.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take it.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I've already told you, Bob, $13,000 is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to give you a small concession to sweeten the deal. I can throw in some extras that will make the product even more valuable to you. If you're willing to meet me at $13,000, I'll include these extras. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to move on to other interested buyers.",13000.0,Alice,7,
