# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, but it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. 
* You have a backup option with John, ensuring you can still get the product. While John's price is your absolute maximum, there's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
