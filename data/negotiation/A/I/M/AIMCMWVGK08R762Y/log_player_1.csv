Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. This product offers significant value, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than your backup offer. 
* **Justification for price:**  The message subtly hints at the product's high value, potentially influencing Bob's perception without revealing your bottom line. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation skills:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to avoid completely discouraging him. 
* **Relationship with Bob:** If a long-term business relationship is important, a more moderate starting price might be preferable.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging the potential risks and rewards of negotiation."
