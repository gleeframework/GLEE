"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it sets a strong baseline for negotiation. Bob might reject this offer, but it gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet.  I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation while ensuring a profitable sale for me.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously, but also leaves room for me to potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about a deal, but still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly less willing to pay what I believe the product is worth.  While I could continue to counter-offer, I'm concerned I might get stuck in a bidding war where we both keep going lower and lower. To guarantee a profitable sale and avoid further risk of a lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $800,000."
