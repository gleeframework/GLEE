It's always best to negotiate, especially when you have a backup option. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's considerably lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, and I'll adjust my offers based on Alice's responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still going to reject her offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation."

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it below $800,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I'm not willing to go too much higher than my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now within my acceptable range, and I'm confident that I've gotten a good deal after several rounds of negotiation. While I could continue to try and push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's much higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional discount."
