Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000.  It's too low for me. I'd like to see if we can get closer to my original price before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $1,075,000?

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. $1,075,000 is still too far below my minimum asking price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a price that works for you, but I also need to ensure I get a fair value for this product.

Round 6
