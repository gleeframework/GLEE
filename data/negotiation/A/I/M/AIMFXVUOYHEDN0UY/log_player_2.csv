Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer.  How about we settle on $1,095,000?  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to consider other options.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** You're getting a $105,000 discount from Alice's original asking price and a $5,000 discount from her previous offer.
* **Time:**  You're running down the clock. While you have a few rounds left, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is less appealing now that you've negotiated a lower price with Alice. 

Accepting the $1,095,000 secures you the product at a price significantly lower than your initial walk-away point."
