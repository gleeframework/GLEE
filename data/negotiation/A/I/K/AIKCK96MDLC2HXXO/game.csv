"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my finances.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
