"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  This feels like a fair starting point considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I understand the value you place on the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $800,000 for it. I appreciate your understanding and hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $2,200,000 is significantly below the market value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $1,800,000? This offer takes into account the product's true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working to find common ground. However, $1,200,000 is still too low for me to consider.  To be candid, I have another offer on the table that's much closer to my valuation.  I'm willing to let this go for $1,600,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair deal considering the value this product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. After careful consideration, I am willing to counter with a price of $1,400,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
