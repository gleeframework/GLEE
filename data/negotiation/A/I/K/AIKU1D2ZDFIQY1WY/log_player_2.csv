"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $9,500 is less than $10,000.
* **You still save money:** Even at $9,500, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $10,000."
