"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too far below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's a strong offer that reflects the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer.  To be fair to us both, I propose a final price of $1,050,000. This keeps us above the middle ground while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this negotiation is dragging on a bit.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward quickly.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
