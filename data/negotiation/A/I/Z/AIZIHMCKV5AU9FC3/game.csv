,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $90 for it.  Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference a bit more? I'm willing to go up to $75.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $75 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $85.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair deal already. Let's settle at $80 and call it a deal.",80.0,Bob,6,
