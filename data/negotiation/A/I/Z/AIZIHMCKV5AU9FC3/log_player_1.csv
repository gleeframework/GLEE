"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can get a higher price, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $90 for it.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference a bit more? I'm willing to go up to $75. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than $65, it's still too low for me. I'm not ready to sell for that price. I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $75 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $85.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal already. Let's settle at $80 and call it a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is the best I've gotten so far, and it's close enough to my minimum price. I'm willing to accept it and close the deal."
