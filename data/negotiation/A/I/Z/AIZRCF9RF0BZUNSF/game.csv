"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it would bring to my business.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my comfort zone. How about we settle on $1,175,000? I'm serious about making this work and believe this price is a good compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,175,000. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest,  $1,250,000 is very tempting, but I have a strict budget.  Would you consider $1,200,000? That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
