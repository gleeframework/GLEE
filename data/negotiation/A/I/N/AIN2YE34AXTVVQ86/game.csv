"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a better deal, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's still a great value for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this deal happen.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $8,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise to get this deal done. How about we meet at $7,500? It's still a great value for you, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Alice,5,
