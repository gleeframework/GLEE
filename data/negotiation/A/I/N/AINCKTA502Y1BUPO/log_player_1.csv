Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to capitalize on his potential interest. I'll be ready to negotiate if he counters, but I also have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $100 is well below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $115 is the lowest I can go given the value of the product. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is close enough to my desired price.  While I'd prefer $115, it's not worth risking losing the sale completely. Accepting his offer ensures a profit and avoids any further negotiation."
