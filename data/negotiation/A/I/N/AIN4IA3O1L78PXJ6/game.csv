"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My starting price is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we try $950,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but let's try to bridge the gap a bit further.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $925,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about we settle at $975,000?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
