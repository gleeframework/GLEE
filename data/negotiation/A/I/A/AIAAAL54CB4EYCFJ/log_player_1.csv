"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($22,000) well above both your minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000) provides room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and features"" aims to anchor the product's worth in Bob's mind at a higher level.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence suggests the offer is fair and encourages Bob to consider the value seriously. 

This strategy allows for flexibility in subsequent rounds while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $18,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $18,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly above his perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:**  See how much he's willing to move towards your price range.
* **Maintain negotiating position:**  Avoid appearing overly eager to accept the first counteroffer. 

You'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. Considering the product's unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $20,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Lowering the price by $2,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a firm stance above your minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's unique aspects aims to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Compromise:** Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your target range.

You're strategically moving towards a potential agreement while still aiming for a price that benefits you significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'll consider it, but I'd like to propose $19,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this helps move us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically, but he's still significantly below your minimum.  While $19,000 is tempting, holding firm now could lead to a better outcome:

* **Testing Bob's resolve:**  By rejecting this offer, you gauge how much further he's willing to go. He might be getting close to his maximum.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With six rounds left, you have time for a few more counteroffers. Walking away now might be premature.

You'll counter with a smaller price reduction in the next round to signal you're nearing your bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $19,500. However, I need you to understand this is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 19500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Clearly stating this is your ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and signals you're at your limit. 
* **Small Concession:** A $500 reduction shows flexibility while reinforcing the seriousness of the ""final offer.""
* **Direct Communication:** You're directly conveying the importance of reaching an agreement at this price point.

This approach aims to secure a deal at $19,500. If Bob rejects it, you're still in a good position to consider John's offer or potentially renegotiate with Bob if you believe he might go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose $19,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob increased his offer after you presented your ""final offer."" This suggests he's serious about buying and might not go higher.
* **Minimal Difference:** The difference between his offer ($19,000) and your previous price ($19,500) is relatively small.
* **Time Remaining:** While you have rounds left, there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal.  Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away.

It's a good outcome to secure $19,000 for the product, especially since Bob was initially only willing to pay $18,000."
