# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject this offer and pursue the better deal."
