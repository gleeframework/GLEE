Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value, even exceeding the price tag."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, I aim to nudge Bob's perception closer to my asking price. 
* **Alternative:**  I'm aware of John's standing offer, which acts as a strong fallback option. This knowledge empowers me to negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't let it go for less than $1,125,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm signaling firmness by stating this is my final offer. However, the price is still slightly negotiable, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Bob will walk away, but the potential gain of securing a price significantly higher than his initial offer is worth the calculated risk. I still have John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $1,100,000. This is my final offer before considering purchasing the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Expectations:** Bob has increased his offer significantly and is now only $25,000 away from my final offer. This suggests he's serious about buying.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  His ""final offer"" statement creates a sense of urgency and implies he may be considering alternatives.
* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, selling at $1,100,000 still nets me a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
