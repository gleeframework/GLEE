"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $10500? I think that's a fair price for this product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit higher than your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $10500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $11200. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about we try $10800? I think that's a fair price for this product.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're still trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10800. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11100. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",11100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $11100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer: $10500. If you're willing to sell it to me at that price, I'm willing to make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $10700. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",10700.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $10700 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a deal at $10400. If you're willing to sell it to me at that price, I'll make it happen.",10400.0,Bob,10,
