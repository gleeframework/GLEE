"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $95, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $102.50. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. My final offer is $97.50. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $97.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $101. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",101.0,Alice,7,
