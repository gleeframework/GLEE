Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,600,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks Bob lowering his offer or walking away. John's offer provides a safety net, but accepting Bob's offer now secures a sure profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner allows me to reinvest the earnings more quickly."
