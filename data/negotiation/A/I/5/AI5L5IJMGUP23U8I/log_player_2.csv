Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to go lower than $915,000. This is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering that I only have 3 rounds left, and I'm close to my target price with John, it's more efficient to buy from him now."
