"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** However, it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **You're setting your maximum price.**  You're not willing to pay more than $8,000 for the product. 
* **This is a strong opening counteroffer.**  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it establishes your price point and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum price of $8,000. 
* **Rejecting allows for continued negotiation.** You can make another counteroffer to try and reach a price you're comfortable with.
* **Buying from John is a safe alternative.** But, it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your maximum price of $8,000 and Alice's offer of $9,500. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate but also sets a clear boundary. 
* **Increased chance of acceptance:** Alice may be more likely to accept this offer, as it's closer to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Even though she lowered her price, it's still above your maximum price of $8,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.** Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price, but not significantly.
* **Buying from John is the best option now.** It ensures you get the product at your desired price and avoids further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
