"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,750,000. This is a terrible deal for Bob. Bob should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price. If Alice doesn't accept a reasonable counteroffer, Bob can always buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob should start by making a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is the maximum amount he's willing to pay, and it's the same price John is willing to sell it for. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide whether to accept a lower price or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,250,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum. There's still a chance Alice might lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Bob should counteroffer with $1,100,000. This is a compromise that is closer to his maximum budget while also showing Alice he's willing to negotiate. It's still a good deal for Alice, as it's above his maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than his maximum budget. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  He's already shown he's willing to compromise, so there's a good chance Alice will accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Bob should counteroffer with $1,050,000. This is a compromise that is closer to his maximum budget but also allows some room for negotiation. It's still a good deal for Alice, as it's above his maximum price. It also demonstrates that Bob is willing to meet her halfway, which could encourage her to accept the deal."
