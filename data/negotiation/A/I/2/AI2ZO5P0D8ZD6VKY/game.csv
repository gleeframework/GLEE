"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the best deal I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Alice,7,
