"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $120, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and see if you can get a better price.  There's no harm in trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give Alice a strong incentive to negotiate and potentially lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to remember that I can always buy the product from John for $120 if I don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good price.  I'm hoping to meet Alice halfway and come to an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $108 is now within my acceptable range.  It's lower than what I initially planned to pay (my maximum is $120) and a better price than I could get from John. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially having Alice raise the price again.  It's time to accept the offer and get the product at a good price."
