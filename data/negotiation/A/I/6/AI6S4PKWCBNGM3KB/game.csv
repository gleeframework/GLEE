"I appreciate your initial offer, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $15,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
