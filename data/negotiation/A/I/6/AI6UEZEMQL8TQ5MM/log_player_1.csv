{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this presents a fair deal, especially considering the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $1,300,000 aims for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's crucial to position the offer as beneficial to Bob, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's inherent value. 

**Why not higher?**  While you could start higher, getting closer to $1,500,000 significantly increases the risk of Bob immediately rejecting the offer.  This strategy seeks to balance maximizing profit with securing a deal."
