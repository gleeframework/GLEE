Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had so far, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies there is other interest (""interest I've had so far""), creating a sense of scarcity and potential competition. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message ends with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just giving a flat ""yes"" or ""no.""

While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, this strategy aims to maximize profit by potentially securing a higher price from Bob."
