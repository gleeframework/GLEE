"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see its worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
