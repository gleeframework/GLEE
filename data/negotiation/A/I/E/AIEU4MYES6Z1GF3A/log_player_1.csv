Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While I don't want to reveal my minimum price ($8,000), mentioning that it's worth at least that much to me might add weight to the offer.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
