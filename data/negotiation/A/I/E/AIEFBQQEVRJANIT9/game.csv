"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? It's still a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
