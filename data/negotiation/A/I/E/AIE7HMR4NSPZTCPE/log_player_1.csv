Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset I know you'll find beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 gives you significant room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" of the product without being overly specific. This allows Bob to potentially justify the high price in his mind.
* **Urgency:**  Phrases like ""unique opportunity"" subtly create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can always come down in price, but you can't go back up after a lower offer."
