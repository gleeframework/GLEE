"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $105?  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about $102.50? That's just a small adjustment, and it would get us closer to a deal. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $102.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $98? I'm willing to make one more compromise.",98.0,Bob,6,
