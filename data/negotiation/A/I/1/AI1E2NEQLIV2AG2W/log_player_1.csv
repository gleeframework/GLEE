Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to go significantly higher.  While we could counter in the hopes he comes closer to $1,500,000, it's not worth the risk of him stalling or lowballing further. We have a guaranteed offer from John at our minimum acceptable price."
