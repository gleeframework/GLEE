"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you this unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's incredibly fair to both of us. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
