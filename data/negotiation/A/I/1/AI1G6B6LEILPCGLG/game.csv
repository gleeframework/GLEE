"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the product's value, but I'm not sure it's worth $20000. I'm willing to pay $6000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to pay $12000. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $10500. I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $8000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
