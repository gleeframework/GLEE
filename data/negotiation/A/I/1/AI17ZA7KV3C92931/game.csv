"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I do appreciate the product, $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $12000 for it.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $16000, which is $14000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there with $14000.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $16000 again, which is $14500. This is my final counteroffer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",14500.0,Alice,7,
