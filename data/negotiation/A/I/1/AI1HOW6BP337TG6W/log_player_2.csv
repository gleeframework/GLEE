"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Buying from Alice saves you $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000).
* **You are still getting a good deal.**  Alice is selling the product for more than it's worth to her, but you're paying less than your maximum."
