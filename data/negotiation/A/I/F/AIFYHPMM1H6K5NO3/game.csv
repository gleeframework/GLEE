"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to be reasonable. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference from my original offer? Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and this price would be more comfortable for me.",8000.0,Bob,4,
