Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining or for Bob to accept a price higher than your fallback option.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that the product is worth at least $100, Alice anchors Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
