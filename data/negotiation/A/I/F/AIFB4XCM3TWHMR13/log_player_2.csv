"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are looking to save as much as possible.  Since Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price point, reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you want to save as much as possible,  $13,500 is a good compromise.  It's still less than what you'd pay John, and you're closer to your desired price point. Accepting this offer is the best option in this scenario."
