"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than your target price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. It allows you to purchase the product at a price significantly below its true value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you can get from John. Continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
