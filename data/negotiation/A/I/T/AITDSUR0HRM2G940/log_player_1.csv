Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's reasonable given the product's worth to Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a substantial amount, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering to sell the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will bridge the gap and lead to a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, it's clear Bob is unwilling to budge much.  This offer from John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
