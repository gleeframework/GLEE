"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value for us both. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and preferences, is priced at $1,200,000. I believe this offers a fair balance between its intrinsic worth and your valuation, making it an attractive proposition for you. I look forward to discussing how we can make this acquisition a reality for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than her product valuation, it's still considerably more than your maximum budget and what John is offering. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase the product from John at a much lower price."
