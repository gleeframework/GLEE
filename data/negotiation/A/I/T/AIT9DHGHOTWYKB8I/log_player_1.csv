"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and get a sense of his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I believe I can do better.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but represents a compromise from my initial offer. I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping I can still get a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer, as it's fair to both of us. This is a win-win scenario, as it allows me to meet my minimum requirement and Bob can get the product at a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to pay my minimum price.  With only four rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing out on the sale altogether.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum profit, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation."
