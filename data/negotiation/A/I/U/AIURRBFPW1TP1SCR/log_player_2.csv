"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Alice's offer because it is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $100.  I will proceed to the next round and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $160. How about we settle on $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $160 is closer to my budget than Alice's first offer, it is still too high. I will reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while still staying within my price range.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $155. How about we try $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still too high for my budget, even with her compromise. While I'd love to continue negotiating, we're already at round 5 and the likelihood of her coming down to my price range is getting slim. To avoid further time wasted, I'll purchase the product from John for $100."
