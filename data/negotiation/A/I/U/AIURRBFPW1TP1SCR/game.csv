"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if you're open to that price.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $160. How about we settle on $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while still staying within my price range.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $155. How about we try $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
