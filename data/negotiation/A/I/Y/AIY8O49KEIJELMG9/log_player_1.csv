Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price a bit, but I want to see how far he's willing to go first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. Hopefully, this will incentivize him to accept and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get us closer to my desired price.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum price, so I'm taking that option."
