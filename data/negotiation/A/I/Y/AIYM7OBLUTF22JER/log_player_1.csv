Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures Alice a significant profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While Alice could try for a much higher price, it might make Bob immediately lose interest.  A price of $145 is still a significant markup but doesn't seem outrageously high."
