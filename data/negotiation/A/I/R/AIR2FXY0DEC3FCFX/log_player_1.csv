"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $120 is still below the product's worth to Bob, making it a potentially appealing offer. 
* **Open and friendly tone:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is too low:** While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **More negotiation potential:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. I have 8 rounds left, giving me enough time to work with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly to encourage a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $85 is only $5 above my absolute minimum, it's still a profit and I'm getting closer to Bob's value.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already in round 4, and I'm not sure if I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject my next counteroffer and I'll be forced to sell to John for $80. Accepting now guarantees a profit."
