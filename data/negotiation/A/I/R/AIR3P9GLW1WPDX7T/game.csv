,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130 to make this work.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $130 is still a bit high for me though. I'm willing to go up to $125.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $125 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $127.50?  I think that's fair to both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,
