"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's a range where both of you can profit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $95? That's still a good price for you and a good deal for me."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $105? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $105 is within your budget of $120.  It's a fair compromise, and you're likely to get a better deal than buying from John."
