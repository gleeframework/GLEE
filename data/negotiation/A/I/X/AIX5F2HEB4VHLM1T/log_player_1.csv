"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm open to offers, but I'm starting at $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always best to start with a higher price, as it gives you room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Showing confidence:**  A confident starting price suggests you believe in the value of the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $15,000 is a good starting point, giving Bob some room to bargain while still ensuring you're above your minimum. 
* **Friendly and open tone:**  A friendly approach can make Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** $8,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to close the deal, and you can counteroffer Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always sell to John for $10,000, but there's potential to get more from Bob.

This response indicates you're not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer but are open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to come down to $12,000.  This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  Dropping from $15,000 to $12,000 shows a willingness to compromise without immediately going to your minimum. 
* **Highlight the benefits for Bob:**  Pointing out that $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob might make him more likely to accept.
* **Maintain a friendly and open tone:**  Keeping the conversation positive can make Bob more receptive to continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. Can we consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Time is running out:**  You only have 6 rounds left, and there's no guarantee you can get a better offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even if you reject Bob, you can still sell to John for $10,000. However, accepting Bob's offer secures a deal and ensures a profit. 

While you might be able to negotiate slightly higher, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a sale in a timely manner."
