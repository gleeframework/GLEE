"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $725,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $725,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be open to $680,000?",680000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $710,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a very competitive price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you think?",710000.0,Alice,5,
