"Alice, $25000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $10000. Let me know if that's something you're willing to work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still more than I can afford. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $14000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $14000. How about we meet at $16000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still trying to get the price down a bit. I'm willing to go up to $15000. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy. ",15000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal - I'll include a free accessory that's worth $1000. So, for $15000, you'll get the product and the accessory. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
