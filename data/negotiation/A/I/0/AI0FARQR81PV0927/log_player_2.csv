"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's truly worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $900,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, but also reflects the product's true value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your honesty. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **You're getting a good deal:** $1,050,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and John's offer.
* **Alice is firm:**  She has stated this is her final offer. Further negotiation might make her pull out of the deal entirely.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price and delays getting the product."
