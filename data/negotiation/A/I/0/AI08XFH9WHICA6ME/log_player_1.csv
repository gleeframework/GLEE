Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're earning more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $100, so there's room for you to potentially get closer to that price.
* **It's a fair opening offer:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is above your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $90? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely or that the negotiations will drag on for too long. Accepting Bob's offer of $87 ensures you get a decent profit while also securing the sale."
