Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's lower than your minimum acceptable price, giving room for negotiation.  It also shows that you're open to a deal and willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject this offer and counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $95? It's a fair price, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $90. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with John, who's willing to pay my full asking price.  I'll sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
