"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and allows Bob to save $4,000 compared to his initial valuation of $15,000.  There's no guarantee Bob can get a better price in further negotiation, so accepting this offer is a sensible choice."
