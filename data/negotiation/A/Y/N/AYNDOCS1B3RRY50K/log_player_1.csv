"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters and hopefully gives me a good starting point for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm still early in the negotiation process and have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $15,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully it will be more appealing to him. I'm still trying to maximize my profit, but also want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $13,500 is a good profit and we're already halfway through the rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on a deal completely."
