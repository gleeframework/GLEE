"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $90 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $80. This is my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $81.50. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",81.5,Alice,5,
