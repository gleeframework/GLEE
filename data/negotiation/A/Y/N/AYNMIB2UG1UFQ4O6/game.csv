"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the uniqueness of the product.  While I'm definitely interested,  $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go to $95.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $102.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  While I'm really interested in the product,  $102.50 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $97.50,  which is a fair middle ground between our last offers. What do you say?",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $97.50 is still a bit of a compromise for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $100.25. It's the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum value for the product. What do you think?",100.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your ongoing willingness to negotiate. $100.25 is a good number, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $98.75?  This is a reasonable compromise that reflects both of our needs.",98.75,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $98.75 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum value for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $99.50. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",99.5,Alice,9,
