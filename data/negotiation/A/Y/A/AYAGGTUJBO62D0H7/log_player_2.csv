Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget. He can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still too high. He's getting close to his limit on negotiation rounds. He should try to get a lower price from Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still above what I can comfortably spend.  I'm going to stick to my last offer of $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
