{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it'll be even more valuable to you. My starting price is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my original price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to finding a solution, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
