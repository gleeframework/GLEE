Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's more than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also being realistic about Bob's potential to accept. If he rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.  If the negotiation stalls, I can always turn to John and secure the $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my desired profit. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price. 

If Bob accepts, I'm happy with the deal. If he rejects again, I'll need to consider if his potential counteroffers are worth my time or if it's better to sell to John at that point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now getting dangerously close to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price than John's offer is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
