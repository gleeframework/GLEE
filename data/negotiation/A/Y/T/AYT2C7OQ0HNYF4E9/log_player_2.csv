"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is your maximum budget, you have no incentive to accept the offer. You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no advantage to buying from Alice."
