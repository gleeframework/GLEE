"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's a significant discount for Bob, but still leaves you with a decent profit. It also gives you room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $80. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which still gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is close to my minimum, I'm still not quite satisfied. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I'm willing to come down to $108.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 108}
