{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're getting close, but there's still room to negotiate. Let's see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to end the negotiation quickly by offering Alice her ideal price. It's the best possible outcome for us while remaining fair to Alice. If she rejects this, we know she's not willing to negotiate reasonably and we can consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to settle at $120, Bob. I can do $128, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is not willing to sell the product for a price that works for us.  She rejected our offer of $120, which is already her ideal price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and we risk running out of rounds and potentially paying even more than John's price."
