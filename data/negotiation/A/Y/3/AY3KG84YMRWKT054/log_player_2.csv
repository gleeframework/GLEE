"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to lower her price further, allowing you to save even more money. If Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000."
