Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start with my minimum asking price, $1,200,000. This is the price I would get from John, and I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet it.  If he isn't, we can negotiate, but I have a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still significantly more than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible.  If Bob accepts this offer, it's a good outcome for me, but I'm prepared to go another round if necessary."
