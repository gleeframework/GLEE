"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a much lower price than $950,000.  Since he has a maximum budget of $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering $700,000, which is still a profitable sale for Alice as it's higher than her valuation of $800,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than the initial $950,000, it's still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. The goal is to get as close to his ideal price as possible.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $700,000 to $850,000. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but is still pushing for a good price.  This offer is a good compromise point, closer to Alice's value and still within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is now very close to Bob's ideal price. While he could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or Bob losing time is high.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price without jeopardizing the opportunity."
