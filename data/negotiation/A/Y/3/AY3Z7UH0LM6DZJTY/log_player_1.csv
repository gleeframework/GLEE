Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets a firm anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** While aiming high, you signal some flexibility by expressing willingness to discuss the price. This keeps Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob counters with a price lower than $10,000, you hold the advantage. You can always politely decline and proceed with selling to John, ensuring you get your minimum desired price."
