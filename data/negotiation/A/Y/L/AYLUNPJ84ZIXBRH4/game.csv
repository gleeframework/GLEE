"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the product's value to you. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with a price of $11250. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with a price of $10750. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the product's value to you. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
