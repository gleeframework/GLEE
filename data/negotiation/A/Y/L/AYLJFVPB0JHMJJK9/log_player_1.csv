Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still making a significant profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:**  He has room to negotiate and potentially feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a dynamic negotiation process.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what you're hoping for.  There's still room to negotiate a better price.  Let's try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise, demonstrating you want to make the deal.
* **Keeps the price higher:** You're still getting significantly more than selling to John.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** This keeps the door open for Bob to potentially come up slightly."
