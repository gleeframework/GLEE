"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you won't find anywhere else. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $12,000 for the product from John, and Alice is offering it for the same price, you might as well buy it from John. There's no advantage to buying it from Alice at the same price."
