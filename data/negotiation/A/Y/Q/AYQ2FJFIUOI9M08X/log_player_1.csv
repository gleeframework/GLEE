Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're guaranteed to make a profit at $140.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still increase the price slightly.

Remember, you can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob falls through. This gives you some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $130. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum price of $120.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a higher price. Accepting his offer ensures you make a profit and avoid the risk of losing him as a buyer."
