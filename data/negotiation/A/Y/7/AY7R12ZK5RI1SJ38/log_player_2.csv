"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John offers. It's best to negotiate down or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By offering $8,000, I signal that I'm serious but also expecting a counteroffer.  
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind John's offer of $12,000. If Alice is unwilling to negotiate towards a reasonable price, I can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down slightly, $18,000 is still significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer. 
* **Slow Negotiation:** Alice's counteroffer suggests she might be slow to negotiate down to a price I'm willing to pay.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I'll use John's offer of $12,000 as leverage in my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $10,000.  I need to stay within my budget, and I believe this is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer to $10,000, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying Firm:** My offer is still significantly below her price and closer to my goal. This keeps the pressure on Alice.
* **Time Factor:** I'm subtly hinting that my time is valuable and I have other options (John's offer)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing some movement towards a deal here. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice is definitely moving in the right direction, but $14,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer.
* **Final Push:** I'm going to make one final offer that's slightly above John's price to try and secure the deal. If Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $11,000.  That's the most I can do, but I think it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last attempt to negotiate with Alice before accepting John's offer.
* **Slight Incentive:** Offering $11,000 is still below my maximum budget and provides a small but potentially tempting saving for Alice compared to John's price. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm mentally prepared to buy from John if Alice rejects this offer."
