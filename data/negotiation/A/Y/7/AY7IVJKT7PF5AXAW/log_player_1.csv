"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,500,000, you set a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he doesn't accept this initial price, it might influence his counteroffers to be closer to your range.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While you have a backup offer from John, remember your goal is to maximize profit.  This initial offer leaves space to potentially accept a counteroffer from Bob above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my top offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value of the product, which is significantly lower than both your minimum and John's offer. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss. It's strategically better to counter-offer and negotiate towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial price reflects the unique and significant potential this product holds, which goes beyond the standard market assessment.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this revised offer presents a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  Coming down from the initial offer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Justify the Price:**  By highlighting the ""unique and significant potential,"" you re-emphasize the value proposition beyond Bob's current perception.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While a significant drop, the new price keeps you well above both Bob's offer and John's offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm at $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** Bob's offer has increased, showing he's willing to move closer to your range. This indicates potential for a better deal.
* **Above John's Offer:**  Bob's current offer is still above your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** You still have rounds and the option to walk away to John, giving you leverage to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise here.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,225,000. This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,100,000) and your previous price ($1,350,000). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message conveys a sense of firmness (""my bottom line"") while still leaving room for a deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is just above John's offer, maximizing potential profit while still maintaining the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
