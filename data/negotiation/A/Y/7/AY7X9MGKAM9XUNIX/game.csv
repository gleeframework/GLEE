"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $925,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  $925,000 is too low. My final offer is $1,025,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I won't go any lower.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
