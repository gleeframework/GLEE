{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows me to earn a significant profit, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested in a lower price.  It also shows I'm willing to be flexible, which can encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my target and a good deal for me.  It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will simply walk away and I'll be forced to sell to John for less.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer."
