Alice's offer is too high. It's worth going to the next round and seeing if you can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $150. It's a great compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's counteroffer is a slight improvement, it's still above your budget. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $100."
