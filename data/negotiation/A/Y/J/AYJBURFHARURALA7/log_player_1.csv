Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product  before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob's perceived value is $8,000, we don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly"", we create a sense of scarcity and potential competition. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The $12,000 offer is a potential compromise. It's a significant profit for Alice if Bob accepts, and still leaves room to negotiate down closer to $8,000 if necessary.

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate. If Bob outright rejects $12,000, she can gauge his counter-offer and decide if she wants to go lower, knowing she has a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
