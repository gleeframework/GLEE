"Alice,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, but I'm not going to go any higher. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? It's still a great deal, and I think we can find common ground here.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $12,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
