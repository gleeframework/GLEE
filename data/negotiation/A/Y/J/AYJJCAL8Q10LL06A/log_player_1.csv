Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, but I'm not going to go any higher. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? It's still a great deal, and I think we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $12,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough and I don't want to risk losing him entirely.  I'm also getting more than my minimum goal of $12,000."
