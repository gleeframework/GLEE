"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, giving me room to negotiate. It's also a substantial enough price to pique Bob's interest without being outrageous.  I'm hoping to gauge his initial reaction and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,500. This is a significant move towards Bob's offer, showing that I'm serious about closing the deal.  However, it's still slightly above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but also that I'm not going to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  At this point, I've had several rounds of negotiation and I'm concerned that I won't be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with. It's best for me to sell to John for $12,000 and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
