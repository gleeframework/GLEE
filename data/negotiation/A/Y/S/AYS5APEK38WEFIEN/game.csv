"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product and the added benefits, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $850,000.  This price would still be a significant gain for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. However, given the high demand for our product and the value it brings, I cannot reduce the price below $900,000. To accommodate your budget, I am including an additional year of maintenance and support services without increasing the price. Would you like to proceed with this offer?",900000.0,Alice,3,
