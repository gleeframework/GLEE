Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the value Bob places on the product. This gives me room to negotiate if he counter-offers.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I highlight the value Bob gets from the product, encouraging him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering slightly less than Bob's perceived value, I leave room for him to counter-offer without making me feel like I'm giving away too much. 
* **Potential for Success:** This offer is likely to be accepted, as it's a good deal for Bob, and it allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** I'm still confident in getting a price closer to my desired $14,500. 
* **Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates his willingness to pay more than my minimum, so there's room to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a higher price in the next round of negotiation.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's higher than $13,000 but still lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate my flexibility while still aiming for a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750? It's a fair price that's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep my profit margin."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Fairness:** I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's, which can make it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement while still securing a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price of $13,750.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  At this point, continuing the negotiation could drag on, and I might not achieve a significantly better price.

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer to sell for $13,750, accepting Bob's offer of $13,500 ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
