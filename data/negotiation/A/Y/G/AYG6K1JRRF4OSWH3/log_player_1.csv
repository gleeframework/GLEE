Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and John will pay $1,200,000.  Starting with a high offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price closer to her guaranteed sale price.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but invites Bob's feedback (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling potential flexibility.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  See if he'll counter-offer or reveal his budget limitations.
2. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts the $1,100,000, Alice gets the best possible price.
3. **Safeguard Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at her minimum acceptable price."
