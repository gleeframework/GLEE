Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $20) while also maximizing your potential profit. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
