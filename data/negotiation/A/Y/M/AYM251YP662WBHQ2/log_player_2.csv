# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is technically within your budget, it offers you no savings. You know John is willing to sell the same product for the same price. There's no downside to rejecting Alice's offer in hopes of getting her to propose a lower price."
