Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $10,000 to him, and it allows me some room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I'm happy to sell the product for $10,000, it's worth more to me. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price before selling to John. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  This is a compromise, and a price that I'm still comfortable with. It leaves some room for potential negotiation, but it also gets me closer to my desired price."

Bob is insistent on his price, and I've already countered once.  I'm not comfortable continuing to negotiate down further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  It's best to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $10,000."
