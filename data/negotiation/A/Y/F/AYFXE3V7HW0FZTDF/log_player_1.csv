"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a reasonable starting point considering my minimum value of $100. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I can't accept Bob's first offer. I'm going to try and see if I can get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $125. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell at his low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to $100, but I'm not giving up yet. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round. I'm still hoping I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $115. This is another compromise, but I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also trying to get as close to my desired price as possible. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to start making more concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob seems unwilling to budge, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John at $100 is a guaranteed deal and ensures I don't lose out completely. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's better than risking getting nothing at all if I continue negotiating with Bob."
