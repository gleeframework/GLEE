"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by counter-offering. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will refuse further counteroffers and Bob would be forced to buy from John at $8,000. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, with minimal risk."
