"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I believe the product's value is worth it to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1400000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a living on this sale. I'm thinking of $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a living on this sale, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I'm offering $1300000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
