Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $105 is my final offer - I believe that reflects a fair compromise for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105, and your goal is to get the product for the best possible price. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, making it the most financially sensible option at this point."
