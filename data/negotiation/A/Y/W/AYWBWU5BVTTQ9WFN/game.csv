"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than its worth to you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $9500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm offering it to you for $10250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10250.0,Alice,5,
