I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
