"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10000.0,Alice,5,
