"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,200,000 is considerably below what I can accept. To move this forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $1,400,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,400,000. How about we settle at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's real worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, how about $1,475,000?",1475000.0,Bob,6,
