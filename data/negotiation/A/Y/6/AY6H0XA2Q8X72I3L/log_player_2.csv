{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to start the negotiation process and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $10,200. This shows Alice I'm getting closer to her price point and I'm serious about buying. I'm hoping this small increase will encourage her to accept, but if not, I'm still within my budget and willing to keep negotiating."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, I'm still not willing to pay $10,600. I believe there's still room for further negotiation, and I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $10,400. This is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, but still a bit lower. I'm hoping this shows her I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm also not willing to overpay. If she rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to buy from John."

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $10,500, I'm  only willing to pay $10,000.  There's only one round left, and it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a better price. I'm better off buying from John at his price, which is my maximum."
