"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $12,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be mindful of the product's value. How about we settle at $16,000? This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
