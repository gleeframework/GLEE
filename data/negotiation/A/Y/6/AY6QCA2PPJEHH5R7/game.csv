"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to start with a price of $180. Is this something you'd like to consider?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $140 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $95?  That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $120 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50? ",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'll meet you at $115, which is still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,7,
