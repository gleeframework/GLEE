"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to explore options before committing.  Since you have no information about Alice's minimum price, there's a chance you can get the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $6,000 sets a lower baseline for negotiations.  This signals your strong desire to buy the product but at a price that is significantly below your maximum. It's also a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and allows you to explore further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by dropping her price.  Offering $7,000 shows a commitment to finding a middle ground while also potentially giving Alice enough incentive to consider a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could continue to negotiate, the potential gains are becoming smaller with each round. Accepting the offer at $7,200 saves you $800 compared to buying from John and secures the product. The risk of further negotiation could result in a higher price or losing the deal altogether."
