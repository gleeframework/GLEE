``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value, but below my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my $120 minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $120, so I'll reject it and try to get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
 
I'm counter-offering at $95. This is still above Bob's value but closer to my minimum. It shows a willingness to negotiate but also keeps my profit margin in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $87.50 is still below my minimum value of $120. I'll reject this offer and try to get a price closer to my minimum.  I'm confident I can get a better offer, even if it means taking it to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is just too low for me.  I'm happy to continue working with you, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. How about $92.50?  It's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $92.50.  This is still above Bob's value but closer to my minimum, showing flexibility while keeping my profit in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $92.50 is a compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay under $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum value of $120.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's clear that we won't be able to agree on a price. It's time to move on. John is a sure thing, and I can secure my minimum price with him."
