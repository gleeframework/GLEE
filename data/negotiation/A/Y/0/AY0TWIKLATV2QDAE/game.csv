"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $13,000. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500. Can you meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $11,500 is tempting, it's just a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'd be willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
