Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price as close to Bob's perceived value as possible, knowing he's willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $1,000 buffer allows for some back-and-forth, giving Bob the impression of a ""good deal"" while still giving me a decent profit.
* **Positive framing:**  Using ""great deal"" and ""value to you"" highlights the benefit to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. He's clearly interested, and a counteroffer will show my commitment to a deal. 
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  While $10,000 is my absolute minimum, selling to John would result in a lower profit compared to continuing negotiations with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The ""split the difference"" approach emphasizes a balanced outcome, making it seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  ""Great value"" reinforces the benefit to Bob, encouraging him to accept. 
* **Maintaining profit:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum and a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $13,000. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and a counteroffer might lead to a better deal.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** While $10,000 is my absolute minimum, it's not my desired outcome. I'm aiming for a higher profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $11,500 is tempting, it's just a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $13,000 to $12,500, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **""Meet you halfway"" approach:** This phrase implies a balanced and fair outcome for both parties, making it seem like a reasonable solution.
* **Focus on closing the deal:** The message emphasizes reaching a final agreement and ending the negotiation.
* **Maintain a decent profit:** $12,500 is still above my minimum and provides a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'd be willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $12,000?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $12,000 is just $2,000 below my desired profit margin. 
* **Limited negotiating power:**  Bob has stated his maximum, indicating further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer and continue to negotiate, I risk Bob walking away entirely. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While not ideal, I have John's offer of $10,000 as a backup if the deal with Bob falls through. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal completely."
