"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product for sale. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, it makes no sense to negotiate. You're guaranteed to get the product for the same price from John, so there's no risk or potential for saving money by negotiating."
