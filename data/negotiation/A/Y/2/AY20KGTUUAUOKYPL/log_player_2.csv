"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your specific needs and expectations, with features that truly stand out in its category. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a fair price of $100 for this exceptional product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the benefits it will bring to you. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay Alice $100."
