"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is really the lowest I can go. I know this product is worth every penny and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to budge on her $20,000 price, which is significantly above Bob's budget.  Since there are only 10 rounds,  it's a waste of time to continue negotiating with Alice.  Bob is better off buying the product from John for $15,000 and securing the product within his budget."
