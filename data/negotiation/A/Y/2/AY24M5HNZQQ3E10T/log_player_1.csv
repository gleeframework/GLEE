{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some wiggle room to negotiate, while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum price of $150. It also opens the conversation in a friendly and inviting way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $115?  This would still give you a great deal on the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I'd receive from John. I'll counteroffer one more time, and if Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.
