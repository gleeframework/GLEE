**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, as there's still room to potentially make a deal that's better than John's offer."

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for a bit more, accepting $1,150,000 guarantees a significant profit above my $1,000,000 valuation and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
