Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I can't exceed $80 for this product. Could you consider a price closer to my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

Bob seems firmly rooted at $80. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. It's time to take John's guaranteed $150."
