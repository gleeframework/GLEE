Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This way, I maximize my potential profit, and if he rejects, I can still sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $110. This is still a fair bit lower than my ideal price of $120, but it's a compromise that might be more appealing to Bob than the original offer.  It's a move towards his offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my desired price of $120.  While I would prefer to sell for more, accepting this offer ensures I get a profit, and it's likely we wouldn't be able to negotiate a better price. It's also better than selling to John at $120 as I'll be saving on the time and effort it would take to make the deal with him."
