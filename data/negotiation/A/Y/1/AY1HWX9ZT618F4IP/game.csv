"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $2,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and reflects my willingness to find a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  How about $1,300,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement you've shown. How about $1,450,000?  I think that's a really fair offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
