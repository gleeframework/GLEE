Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,000,000.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. Given the unique benefits, I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, justifying the higher price.
* **Scarcity and Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" aims to make the offer more enticing.
* **Negotiation Room:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he's very interested, potentially earning you even more.

**Important:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and your understanding of his negotiation style, you might adjust the price and message."
