,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $95? It's still a great deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a little out of my budget.  Let's split the difference again and go with $92.50.  That's a fair deal for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $97? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",97.0,Alice,5,
