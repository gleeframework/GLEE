Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. May I suggest we aim for a price closer to $8,000 which I believe is a fair valuation for this product?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob is clearly anchored at $8,000.  There's little point in continuing to negotiate as it's unlikely he'll move significantly. Taking John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
