"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my price range. I'm still quite far away from being able to meet that offer. To be honest, I'm only comfortable going up to $700,000 for this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
