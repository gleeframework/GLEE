"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. $175 is above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 is my final offer. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is better than Alice's original offer, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. You can try to counteroffer again and see if you can get a lower price."
