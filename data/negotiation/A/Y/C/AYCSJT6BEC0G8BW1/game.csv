"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, my budget is a bit tighter. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might better suit both of us. Considering the value of the product to you, I suggest we aim for a price of $9800. This allows us some room to work with while still being competitive. Would you like to discuss this further?",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9800 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm firm on $9200. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am proposing a price of $9600 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product to you while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope this suggestion will be agreeable to you.",9600.0,Alice,5,
