Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but still gives room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's closer to my minimum value and could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is too far below my minimum value of $12,000.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm better off selling to John for the full $12,000."
