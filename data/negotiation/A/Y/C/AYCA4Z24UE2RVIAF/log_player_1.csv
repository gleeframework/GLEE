Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Setting the price at $1,150,000 allows Alice to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential gain.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, keeping him engaged. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides Alice with a strong fallback position. She doesn't need to desperately lowball Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly higher to allow more room for concessions.
* **Relationship Building:** The message is polite and professional, aiming to foster a positive interaction even if Bob rejects the initial offer."
