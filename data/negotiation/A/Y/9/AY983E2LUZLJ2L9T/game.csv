"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $825,000, which is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can shake hands on this.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $825,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've outlined for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that we're getting close to the lower end of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $775,000, so I'll offer you $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
