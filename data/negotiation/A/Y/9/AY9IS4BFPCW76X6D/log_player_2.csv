"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000, a price that I believe is fair considering its potential value to you.  I know you're a discerning buyer, and I'm confident that you'll see the opportunity this product represents. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below your maximum budget, you can still try to negotiate a better price. John's offer of $1,200,000 serves as a fallback option, but there's room to potentially save more than the $50,000 difference."
