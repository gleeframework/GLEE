"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to go lower than $9,000 before needing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, while giving you some breathing room to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price but still higher than your counteroffer. It's worth trying to negotiate again to see if you can get closer to your target price of $8,500. There is still a chance you can lower her price further before needing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice rejected your previous offer of $8,500.  This offer of $8,750 is a compromise, showing you are willing to move closer to her price but still below her new offer of $9,200.  You can likely get it for this price, or you might need to go to John.  You'll likely get it for $9,000 if you continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,350 is getting closer to your target price, but it is still higher than what you are willing to pay.  There is a good chance that if you keep rejecting Alice's offers you can get it for around $9,000.  However, you are now at a point where the negotiation is becoming time-consuming and the risk of not getting the product is increasing. 

Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it's more efficient to just buy it from him.  This avoids further rounds of negotiation and ensures you get the product without exceeding your maximum budget."
