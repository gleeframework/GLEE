Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can either lower the price slightly or see what kind of counteroffer he makes.  I'll be keeping an eye on John's offer as well, just in case this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my initial offer with a counteroffer.  I'm also keeping an eye on John's offer, just in case."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I let it go for $110?  It's a great product that's worth it, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $107.50 is a good compromise. It's still a fair deal for me, considering John is willing to buy for $100.  It's time to close the deal."
