"Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit.  While $13,000 is closer,  I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,000?  That's a good middle ground and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,
