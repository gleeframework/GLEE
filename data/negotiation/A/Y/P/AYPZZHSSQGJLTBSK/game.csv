,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can close this deal. I'm willing to drop my price to $112.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think it reflects a fair compromise. What do you say?",112.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $109. Can you consider that?",109.0,Bob,6,
