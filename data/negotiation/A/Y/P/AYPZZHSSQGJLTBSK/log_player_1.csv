{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with an open invitation to discuss the price, suggesting flexibility. 

This approach balances the need to maximize my profit with the need to keep the negotiation open and avoid Bob immediately rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is interested and has made a counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **John is a backup:**  I have a backup option in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm suggesting a middle ground between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes fairness, keeping the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlight the value:**  I reiterate that I believe the product is a good fit for Bob, implying its value justifies the price.

By offering a compromise and keeping the communication positive, I aim to increase the chances of Bob accepting my counteroffer and reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we try $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting would still result in a loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and his offer is getting closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safety net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $120, providing a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a final counteroffer and try to push the price just a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can close this deal. I'm willing to drop my price to $112.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think it reflects a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm making a final counteroffer that is just $4 away from my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message is positive, highlighting the progress made and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I frame the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially encouraging him to accept.

This counteroffer aims to close the deal while still achieving a price close to my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this, I will sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $109. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $109 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation is stalled:** Bob's final offer is only $1 higher than his previous offer, suggesting a lack of flexibility and a stalemate.
* **John offers a better deal:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer. 

The negotiation with Bob has reached an impasse, and I have a better offer from John.  It's time to move on and secure the higher price."
