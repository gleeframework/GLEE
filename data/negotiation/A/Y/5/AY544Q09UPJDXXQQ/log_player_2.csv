While closer to my desired price range, I'll counteroffer again. There's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating in smaller increments now. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, accepting at $11,250 saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling completely."
