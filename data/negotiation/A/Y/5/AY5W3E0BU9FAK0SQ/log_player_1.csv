Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $12,000. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while also being clear about the price. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximize profit:** By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm increasing the likelihood that Bob will accept the offer. This maximizes my chances of earning more than I would from selling to John.
* **Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, it opens the door for potential negotiation. He might counter with a price closer to $12,000, leading to a mutually beneficial deal."
