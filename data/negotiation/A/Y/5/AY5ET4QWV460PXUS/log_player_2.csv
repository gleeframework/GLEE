"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a bold move.  You're offering significantly less than Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget.  This approach might encourage Alice to be more flexible in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than you're willing to pay.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  There's a good chance Alice will come down further to meet you in the middle, as she's already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer.  $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $120? This is the absolute maximum I can pay."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

You're now offering your maximum price, showing you're serious about the purchase but remaining firm.  By emphasizing the ""split the difference"" aspect, you're appealing to Alice's sense of fairness and hopefully encouraging her to accept."
