Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not too high that it immediately feels unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it higher than Bob's offer. My hope is that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $1,000,000 for the product, Bob's counteroffers are getting increasingly lower. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and selling to him will guarantee a satisfactory profit."
