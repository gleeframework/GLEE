Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable mark-up from my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly low with his offers.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of ending up with nothing is high.  It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
