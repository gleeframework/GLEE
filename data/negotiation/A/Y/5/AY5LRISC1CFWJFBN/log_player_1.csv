"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be highly valuable to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to maximize potential profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's initial interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but 1000000 seems a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Signal Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation, but I won't be pressured into a quick deal.
* **Gain Information:** By counteroffering, I can get a better sense of Bob's true willingness to pay. 
* **Explore Higher Options:** If Bob's counteroffers remain too low, I can still sell to John. 

This strategy allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe this product holds even greater value for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still represent a great deal for you, and it allows me to secure a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential value of the product for him.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm positioning my counteroffer as a win-win scenario for both of us.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but 900000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider 850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of Loss:** If I continue to reject offers, I risk losing a deal altogether.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're nearing the middle of the negotiation, and further rounds might not result in a significantly higher offer.

By accepting this offer, I secure a good price while minimizing the risk of ending up with no sale."
