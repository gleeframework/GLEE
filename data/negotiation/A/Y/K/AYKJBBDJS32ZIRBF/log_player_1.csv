{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll find it very useful. My price for it is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me ($150) but still within a reasonable range, considering John is willing to pay $150. This allows for some negotiation space while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This still gives me a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find the product very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
I'm offering $140, which is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit below my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still too low.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $150.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $150, ensuring a profitable deal."
