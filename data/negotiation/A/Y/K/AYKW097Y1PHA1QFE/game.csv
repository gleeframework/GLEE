"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1,100,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
