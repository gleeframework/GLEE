"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.  I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This price reflects the product's value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to her, so she is making a profit of $200,000. Her offer of $1,000,000 is too high for me, and I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is even higher than Alice's offer. I would like to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
