"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1,050,000. My counteroffer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $1,050,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and dedicated support for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while the added warranty and support are nice, $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's finalize this deal, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $1,075,000, and I'll also include a premium installation service to make the transition as smooth as possible for you. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
