"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get it for less from John. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. It's worth seeing if Alice will go even lower, or he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite at $15,000. How about we split the difference and I pay $13,500?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept the offer.  While $14,000 is still more than his ideal price, it's getting close to his budget and likely the best deal he's going to get from Alice.  He's also running out of rounds, and buying from John is always an option if he wants to keep negotiating."
