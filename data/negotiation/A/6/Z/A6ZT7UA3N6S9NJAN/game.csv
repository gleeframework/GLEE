"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to offer $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $11,500 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
