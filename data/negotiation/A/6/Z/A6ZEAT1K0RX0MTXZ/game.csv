"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
