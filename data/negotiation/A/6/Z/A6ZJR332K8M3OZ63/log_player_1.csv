``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $145. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to him and $120 to me. I believe this gives him a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $138
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $138 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $140.  I'd rather sell to Bob at this price than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for a lower amount."
