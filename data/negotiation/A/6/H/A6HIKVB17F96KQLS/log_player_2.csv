"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  Based on its potential, I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  This price reflects its true worth and allows for a significant return on your investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than John's price of $1,000,000, which is your absolute maximum.
* However, you have room to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price to secure the sale. 

**Strategy:**

You want to aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation."
