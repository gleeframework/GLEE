"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **It's polite and shows continued interest.** You don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away.
* **It's a significant decrease from her offer.** This leaves room for negotiation but also signals that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **It's still within a reasonable range.**  While it's a lowball offer, it's not offensively low considering your budget and the product's value to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which still reflects the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to your range, but there's still room for negotiation. You're willing to pay $800,000 (from John), so there's a chance you can get Alice down closer to that number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Continuing Positive Tone:** We maintain a polite and appreciative tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Incremental Increases:** Instead of a large jump, we're making smaller increments to show willingness to compromise while still moving towards our goal.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing makes the offer seem more appealing as a fair compromise. 

We're getting closer to John's price, so Alice might be more inclined to accept, especially if she wants to avoid losing the sale."
