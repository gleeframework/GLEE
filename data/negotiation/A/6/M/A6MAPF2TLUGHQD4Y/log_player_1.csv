{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob.  This allows for some wiggle room in case Bob counters, and it shows that you value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price. Rejecting his offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which still reflects the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise. You've negotiated down from your initial offer of $850,000 and are closer to a deal with Bob.  Accepting his offer allows you to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  John's offer of $800,000 is tempting, but you've already put in the effort to negotiate with Bob, and this offer is close enough to make it worthwhile."
