Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting what the product is worth, but I'm still open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and it's clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum price. Rather than risk further negotiation that could lead to a lower price, it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure the $1,200,000."
