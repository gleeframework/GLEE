"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
