"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?  This takes into account the unique benefits it offers.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. To be realistic,  my absolute maximum is $1,100,000.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
