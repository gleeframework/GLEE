"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely reject and propose a counteroffer that's closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives you a better sense of Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states that it's unacceptable. Offering $1,000,000 shows you're serious but also open to negotiation.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Alice to respond and continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?  This takes into account the unique benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $1,700,000 is better than the initial offer, but it's still significantly more than your $1,200,000 maximum. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** Alice's willingness to move down from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000 suggests there's more room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  While you want to negotiate the best deal, you have a solid backup option with John's offer of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. To be realistic,  my absolute maximum is $1,100,000.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Raising your offer slightly:** You're still significantly under Alice's price, but moving up to $1,100,000 shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Setting a firm limit:** By stating your ""absolute maximum,"" you signal seriousness and try to anchor the negotiation closer to your target. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Expressing your readiness to ""close the deal"" adds a bit of pressure and might encourage Alice to make a more substantial concession. 
* **John's offer as a backup:**  Keep in mind that if Alice rejects this offer, you can always fall back on John's $1,200,000 price."
