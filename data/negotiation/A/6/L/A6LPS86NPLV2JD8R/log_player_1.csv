Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?  This takes into account the unique benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. To be realistic,  my absolute maximum is $1,100,000.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly closer to my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
