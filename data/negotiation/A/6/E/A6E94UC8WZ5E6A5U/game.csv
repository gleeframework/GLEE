,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still significantly below my bottom line for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,700,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000 for this product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. If you're not able to accept this offer, I will unfortunately have to move forward with another option.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
