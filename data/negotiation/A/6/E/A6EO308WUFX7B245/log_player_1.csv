Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
