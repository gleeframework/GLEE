"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value of your business. Given its worth to you, I propose an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He knows the product is worth more to Alice ($1,200,000) and has a fallback option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am proposing a revised offer of $975,000 for the product. This is my best offer at this time, and I believe it strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's target price.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will stand firm or that the negotiations will drag on.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product for a reasonable price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations.  He's also getting a better deal than he could from John."
