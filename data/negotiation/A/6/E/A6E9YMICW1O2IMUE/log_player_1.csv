Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, knowing that Bob might counteroffer. This allows for negotiation while ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'm also aiming to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject and counter offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```"
