"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, as a gesture of good faith. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer. How about $70? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $70 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This is a very fair price considering the quality of the product.  Let's close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I could do $75, and I think that's a very reasonable offer.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $80. This way we both get a fair deal.  What do you say?",80.0,Alice,7,
