Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also offering significant value to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can potentially still secure a deal above your minimum.
* **Polite and professional tone:** The message aims to build rapport and encourage open communication. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while being mindful that you have a strong alternative if Bob declines."
