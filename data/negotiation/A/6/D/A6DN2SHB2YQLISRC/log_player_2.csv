Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $980,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $995,000? This would be a great deal for both of us. I believe we can close this out now.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and at this point, it's a good deal compared to John's offer. Accepting now saves time and secures the product."
