"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe this product is worth that much to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $980,000?  That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $980,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $995,000? This would be a great deal for both of us. I believe we can close this out now.",995000.0,Alice,7,
