"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $9,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his initial counteroffer. 
* This price is still significantly lower than the $12,000 Bob is willing to pay, achieving a significant saving. 
*  While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John or further delaying the purchase is not worth the potential savings."
