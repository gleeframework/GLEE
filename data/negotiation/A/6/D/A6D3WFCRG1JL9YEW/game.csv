"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $15000.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $13500?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500. How about $12750?,12750.0,Bob,4,
