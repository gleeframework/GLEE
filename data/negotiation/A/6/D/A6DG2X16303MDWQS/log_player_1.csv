Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground that will get us both to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $180.  While I'd like to get a little more, it's closer to my desired price and I'd rather not risk going back and forth for longer, potentially ending up with the lower price from John."
