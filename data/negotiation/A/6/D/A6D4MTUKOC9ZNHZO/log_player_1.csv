Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential earnings and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's significantly more than my minimum value:**  $14,000 is $6,000 more than my floor price of $8,000. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to him, so he's still getting a good deal at $14,000. 
* **Minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $8,000, guaranteeing a profit.

By offering this price, I maximize my chances of getting the higher price from Bob, while still having a solid backup plan if he declines."
