"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm willing to let it go for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90.  While that's a good deal, you can get it for $100 from John. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better choice."
