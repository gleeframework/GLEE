"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and showing your interest. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price, but $1,100,000 is a little lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $1,075,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,110,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my strong desire to see this valuable product in your hands. Let me know your decision.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a significant concession, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider one final offer of $1,080,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us and allows me to walk away with a good deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
