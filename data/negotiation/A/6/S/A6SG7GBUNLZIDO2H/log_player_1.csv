Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob is still negotiating, his offer is getting too close to John's standing offer. It's time to push back firmly to gauge his true interest."

Bob is clearly trying to get the best deal possible, but his offer is now reasonable and significantly above John's offer. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk Bob walking away and potentially getting a lower price from John."
