"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me your product, but I am currently working within a budget that allows me to spend no more than $500000 on this purchase. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1200000. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand that you need to make a profit, but unfortunately, $1200000 is still beyond my current budget.
