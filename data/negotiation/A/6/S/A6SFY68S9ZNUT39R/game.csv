"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $110? This is still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I am still looking to keep my expenses as low as possible.
