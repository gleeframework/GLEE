Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?

Alice is meeting my walk-away price. There's no point in rejecting and risking going over budget with further negotiation."
