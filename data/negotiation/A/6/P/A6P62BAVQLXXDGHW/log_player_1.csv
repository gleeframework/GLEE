Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15,000. It's a real steal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a better price.  The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe I can get closer to that value with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8000. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his $8,000 offer.  While this is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're at an impasse. While I value your business, $8,000 just isn't enough for me to let this product go. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going lower. If you're truly interested, let's close the deal. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 10000}
