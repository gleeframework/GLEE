Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your minimum of $150, but still within a potentially reasonable range for Bob to consider. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you can lower the price or move on to John. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer and you'll miss out on a slightly higher profit. However, this strategy maximizes your potential gain."
