"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too far below my minimum price, and I'm still confident I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and will allow you to get the product you need. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
