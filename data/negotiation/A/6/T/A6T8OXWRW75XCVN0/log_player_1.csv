Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price than my minimum acceptable offer.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than $1,200,000, but I'm not sure how much.  By starting high, I can gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  $1,400,000 is a decent offer, but I believe I can still get a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,350,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my desired price, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiations."
