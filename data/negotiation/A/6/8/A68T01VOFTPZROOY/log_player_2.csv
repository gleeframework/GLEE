Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise at $950,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $950,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000."
