"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, I can't go over $13,000 right now.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to move forward.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
