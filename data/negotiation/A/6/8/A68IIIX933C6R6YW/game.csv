"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $150 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find a buyer who's willing to pay more.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $150. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $160. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",160.0,Alice,5,
