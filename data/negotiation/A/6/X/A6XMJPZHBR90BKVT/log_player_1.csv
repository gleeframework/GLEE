Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost within $1,200,000. Could we perhaps agree on $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking stubbornly to $1,300,000.  We still have negotiating room and rounds available.  It's worth pushing a bit further before accepting his offer or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the price.  $1,325,000 is my final offer. This is a significant investment for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference here to show we're willing to negotiate but also setting a firm boundary.  This creates a sense of urgency and lets Bob know we're serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still looking to keep the cost closer to $1,200,000. Would $1,275,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has finally moved significantly from his $1,300,000 position. Accepting at $1,275,000 secures a reasonable profit above our minimum ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially pushing the price closer to John's offer."
