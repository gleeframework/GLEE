"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  This should keep the negotiation going while putting some pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal. There are several rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, I'm confident that Bob is getting closer to his maximum willingness to pay, and we're both close to a deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $100.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, the negotiation is taking longer than I expected.  I'm confident John will be a reliable buyer and I'll get a better price with him than with Bob."
