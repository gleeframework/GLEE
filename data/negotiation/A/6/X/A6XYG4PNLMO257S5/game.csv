"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to pay $1,250,000 for it, reflecting the potential benefits it offers. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident it will lead to a mutually beneficial partnership. Let's close this deal! ",1250000.0,Bob,2,
