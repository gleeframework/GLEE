"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's worth the investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could we possibly agree on $975,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit low.  I'm confident I can negotiate a slightly better price in the next round.  Additionally, selling to John would still guarantee me a profit.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob for now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you,  I'm willing to offer you one last compromise at $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
