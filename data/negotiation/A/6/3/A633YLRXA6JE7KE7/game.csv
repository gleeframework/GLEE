"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could we possibly agree on $975,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you,  I'm willing to offer you one last compromise at $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen!",1025000.0,Alice,5,
