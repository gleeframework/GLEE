Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring you still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway towards Bob's offer. It maintains a reasonable profit margin for me while demonstrating flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and it's unlikely he will increase it further.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and minimizes further negotiation time."
