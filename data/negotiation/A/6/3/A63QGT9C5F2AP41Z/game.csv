"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $825,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it aligns with the maximum value I'm willing to pay. I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
