Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will indicate how much he values the product and how flexible he might be on price.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can adjust the price downwards, aiming to stay above her minimum."
