"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to $10,000 as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.
