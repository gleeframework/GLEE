Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, which is our baseline. We want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  We need to offer a price below his valuation, but with enough margin to make it worthwhile for us.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle, but still ensures a significant profit above our guaranteed sale price to John. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation, so we need to strike a balance between an attractive offer to Bob and securing a good profit for ourselves."
