"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but  $825,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be open to $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and settle at $762,500?",762500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $772,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",772500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is almost a done deal! I'm willing to make one final push to get this done. How about $768,000, and we shake on it?",768000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $768,000 and $775,000, so I'll offer it to you for $772,250. This is my final and best offer.",772250.0,Alice,9,
