"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at a point where it's close enough to my desired price and the risk of further negotiation is too high.  I'm accepting his offer and closing the deal."
