"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 might be a bit too high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $145.  If we can agree on that, we can finalize the deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $152.50. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",152.5,Alice,5,
