"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable item at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is quite high.  It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to her product's value to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I could do $6,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** My goal is to get the product for significantly less than John's $10,000 offer.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** My message keeps the tone positive and suggests I'm willing to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,500 is too far below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above her perceived value of the product ($8,000). We have room to negotiate further. It's too early to take the $8,500 deal when we might be able to get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  I'm showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate by increasing my offer, but I'm not jumping too high too quickly.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** Suggesting $7,500 aims for a price roughly halfway between our current positions. This might feel like a fair compromise to Alice.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable price."
