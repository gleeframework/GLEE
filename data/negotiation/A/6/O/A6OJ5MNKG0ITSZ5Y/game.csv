"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13500. Would you be willing to meet me at $13200? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.,13200.0,Bob,4,
