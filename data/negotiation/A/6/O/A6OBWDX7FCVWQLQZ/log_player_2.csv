Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000.

I'm confident that buying from John for $8,000 is the best option to ensure I get the product within my budget and avoid further delays."
