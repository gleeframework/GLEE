"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes more sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price. You can likely get a much lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $20,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price.  It's still a bit above your budget, but it shows your willingness to negotiate. This will hopefully start a conversation and get the price closer to your goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still not within your acceptable range. You should continue to negotiate and try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about this product, and I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm:** This counteroffer keeps the price below your limit while showing Alice that you're committed to a deal.
* **Showing flexibility:** You've moved closer to Alice's price, but still not too much. This demonstrates your willingness to compromise without giving away too much. 
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Alice that you are serious about the product emphasizes your desire to close the deal."
