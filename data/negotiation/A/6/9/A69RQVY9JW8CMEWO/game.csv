"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000 for the product.  This price still allows me to achieve a fair return while remaining within your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
