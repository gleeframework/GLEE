It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You can offer a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."

I'm starting with a significant discount to see how Alice responds. This gives us room to negotiate."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a lower price. This is a good compromise point."

Alice has come down to $450,000 which is a better deal than John's offer of $1,000,000. It's worth accepting to save $550,000."
