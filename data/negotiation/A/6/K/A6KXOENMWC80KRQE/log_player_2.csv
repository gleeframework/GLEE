"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's a good starting point,  you want to save more money.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds to work with and can potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is the best backup.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a solid alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're open to discussing this price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1250000 is significantly below what the product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still offers a good deal for you, and it allows me to secure a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price.** While she lowered it, it's still not within your desired range.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.**  You're still early in the process and have more opportunities to get closer to your target price.
* **John's offer remains your safety net.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can still acquire the product at a price you're comfortable with."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us â€“ you get a good deal, and I can stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
