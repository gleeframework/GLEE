"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000. This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're open to discussing this price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1250000 is significantly below what the product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still offers a good deal for you, and it allows me to secure a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This is a fair price for both of us â€“ you get a good deal, and I can stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
