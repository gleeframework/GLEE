"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives us room to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price of $100 as possible.  I'm also being friendly and inviting in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering with $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. I'm keeping the tone friendly and highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking $90 is a fair price for the product. Can you consider meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is close to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $90, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  It's a small compromise on both our ends, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering a compromise at $92.50, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's. I'm trying to emphasize the ""small compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $91.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $100, $91.50 is still a good deal.  We've reached a compromise and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's better to secure this sale than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
