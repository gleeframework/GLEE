"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, a price of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to save money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price $200,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and could potentially push Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant reduction from her original price and only $100,000 more than my counteroffer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go much lower.  Accepting this offer saves me $400,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially beneficial option."
