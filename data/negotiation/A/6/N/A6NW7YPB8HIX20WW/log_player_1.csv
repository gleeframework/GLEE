"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. This is a strategic move to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be. If he's not willing to go near this number, I know I might be better off selling to John and securing my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000,  showing flexibility but still holding out for a significant profit. This counteroffer is a compromise, but it keeps the negotiations moving forward and hopefully convinces Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can secure a better price. It's getting risky, but I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Bob.  I'm not ready to settle for John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $850,000. This is a significant concession, but it's a strategic move. Bob is showing a pattern of offering less and less. I need to signal that I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than $800,000. This counteroffer might be enough to get Bob to accept, but if he rejects it, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm getting concerned. I've already made significant concessions, and with only a few rounds left, it's not clear if we can reach a deal.  The risk of ending up with nothing is too high. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
