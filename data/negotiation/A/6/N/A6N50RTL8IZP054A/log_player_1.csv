Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll try to get closer to $10,000 with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to what I know the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although I'd prefer $10,000, I'm getting closer to my minimum price and the negotiation is getting tedious. I'd rather close the deal than risk another round of back and forth and potentially lose the sale to John."
