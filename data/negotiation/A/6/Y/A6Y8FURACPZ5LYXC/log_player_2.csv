{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to tell if $500,000 is a good price.  Let's see if we can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  $250,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer, but it's still within the range of my budget."

Alice has come down from $500,000 to $400,000, which is a good sign. I'm still going to try and get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}

I'm raising my offer slightly to $350,000.  This is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith.  Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to come closer to my price."
