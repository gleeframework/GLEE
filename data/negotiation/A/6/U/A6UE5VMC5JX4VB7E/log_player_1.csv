"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. It's also above my minimum value of $12,000, so I'm still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum value of $12,000. I can't accept that.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is my minimum value. This is a fair offer, considering Bob's previous low offer, and it allows me to  maximize my profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer again in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. It's still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still only $2,500 above my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and counter in the next round.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a little closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $10,500.  This is a significant concession from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept and close the deal. I only have a few rounds left, so I need to be decisive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob. I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000, ensuring a safe and profitable deal."
