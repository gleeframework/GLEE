"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can't exceed $80 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. $80 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $125? It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. I hope this works for you.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $125. How about we settle on $110?  This would be a fair price for both of us and help us close the deal.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer and am willing to move to $100. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
