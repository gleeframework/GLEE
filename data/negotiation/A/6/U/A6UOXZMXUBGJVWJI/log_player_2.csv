This item holds immense value to me, but I understand its potential worth to you is even greater at $1,500,000. After careful consideration, I am offering to sell it to you at a special price, aiming to find a balance between our interests. I propose we discuss a fair transaction that respects both the intrinsic value of the product and your willingness to pay. Let's aim for a price that exceeds my cost while still being attractive to you. I look forward to exploring this possibility further. Kind regards, Alice.
