"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's target price of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $7,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $7,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. I'll offer you the product for $7,200. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $7,200, which is within Bob's target price range of $8,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product while still saving $800 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
