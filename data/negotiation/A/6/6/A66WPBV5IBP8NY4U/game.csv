"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really set on getting this product, so let's split the difference. I'll pay $140 for it.  This is my final offer.",140.0,Bob,4,
