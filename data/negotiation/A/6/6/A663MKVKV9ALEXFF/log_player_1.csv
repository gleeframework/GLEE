Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell to him now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
