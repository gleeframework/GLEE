I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This allows some room for negotiation while ensuring I still get a good profit. I've also included a message that emphasizes the value of the product and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $1150000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob's offer of $1,180,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll take his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a guaranteed profit."
