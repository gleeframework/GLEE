"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to own this product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $7,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $8,250.  It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit, and $8,250 is getting closer to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you the product for $8,500 was a bit high, but I can go as low as $8,750 is too low, so I will go for $8,375. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",8375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,375 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours.  I'll offer $8,312.50, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",8312.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not sure if $8,312.50 is enough for me to make a profit. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to think about the value of the product. I can offer you the product for $8,350. It's a small increase, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot for both of us. What do you think?",8350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,350 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $8,325. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8325.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not ready to accept $8,325 just yet. I can offer you the product for $8,300. It's a small concession, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",8300.0,Alice,9,
