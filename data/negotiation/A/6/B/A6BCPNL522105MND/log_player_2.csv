You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You can always buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."

It's still possible to negotiate a lower price.  You can try a counteroffer closer to your initial offer of $8,000."

Alice's offer:

It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

Alice is willing to go down to $8,750, which is a good price considering your maximum budget is $10,000 and John is selling it for $10,000.  It's a good deal, so you should accept."
