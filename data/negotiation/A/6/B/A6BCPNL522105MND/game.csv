"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $9000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8500?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $8750. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
