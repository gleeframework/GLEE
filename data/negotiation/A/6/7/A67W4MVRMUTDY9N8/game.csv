"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $11,000. How about we meet at $12,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
