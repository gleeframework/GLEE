"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value to you at $15,000. I am confident it will meet your needs and expectations. To make this opportunity more attractive, I propose a special introductory price of $12,000 for you. This is a fantastic deal considering the high value you see in the product. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice clearly knows you value the product at a higher price and is trying to leverage that.  
* While $12,000 is less than your maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better price by negotiating further or considering John's offer. 
* Rejecting Alice's initial offer opens the door for further negotiation."
