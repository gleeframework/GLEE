**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective on the value.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,225,000 is still a bit high. You're very close to your maximum budget and it's worth seeing if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a more agreeable number."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. While $1,162,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a slightly higher number. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and would prefer to work with you if possible.  Would you be willing to consider $1,195,000?  This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,195,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,195,000 is very close to your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While you could potentially negotiate further, it's likely that Alice is firm on this price, especially with another buyer waiting.  You're getting a good deal, and the product is valuable to you. It's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing the opportunity to buy the product."
