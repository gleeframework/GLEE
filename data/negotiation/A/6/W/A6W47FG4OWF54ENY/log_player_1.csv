""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better outcome.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,400,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
    * It's close enough to our guaranteed price that we're not losing much if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while mitigating the risk of losing the guaranteed sale to John."
