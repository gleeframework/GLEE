"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly below my maximum price of $1,200,000, and it seems likely I can negotiate a better price.  I will try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as it seems like we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  There's still room to bargain before I need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,500, which is very close to my counteroffer of $925,000.  At this point, I'm comfortable accepting the deal.  It's a good price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
