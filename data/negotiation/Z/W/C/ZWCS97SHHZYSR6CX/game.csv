"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive offer of $750000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $680000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",680000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I have to consider the value of the product to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more than $680000. How about $725000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price you'll find reasonable.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700000. It's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a commitment. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700000. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $715000? It's a fair price, and I think it's a price you'll find reasonable.",715000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $710000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm eager to finalize the purchase.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $710000. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $720000? It's a fair price, and I think it's a price you'll find reasonable.",720000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the original price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $715000, but I'm not going any higher. I think that's the best price we can both agree on.",715000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $715000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you at $718000. It's a fair price, and I think it's a price you'll find reasonable. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",718000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $715000. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",715000.0,Bob,10,
