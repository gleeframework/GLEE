Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately risking a rejection and having to sell to John.
* **Positive and confident tone:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and expresses confidence in a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $10000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I still believe there's room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process. This might lead to a better price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and should still provide you with great value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering $11,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value. 
* **Emphasize the value:**  The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes that $11,500 still represents a great deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for a final counteroffer:**  By offering $11,500, I still give Bob a chance to make a counteroffer that might be agreeable for both of us.  However, if his counteroffer falls below $11,500, I will consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer. I would like to stick at $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has remained firm at $10,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a price that meets my minimum value. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 offer from John.

**Conclusion:** Selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible option, as it maximizes my earnings and avoids further negotiation delays."
