Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
    * Slightly below John's offer, creating a sense of urgency and a ""good deal"" for Bob if he values the product more strategically. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential of a higher sale price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
