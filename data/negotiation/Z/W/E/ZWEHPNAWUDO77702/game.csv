"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your target price, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
