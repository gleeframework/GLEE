"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Would you be willing to accept this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $925,000? This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $887,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $887,500 is still too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers you.  I truly hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
