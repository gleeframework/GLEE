Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, this price still earns me a significant profit above my minimum ($10,000).

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value than my minimum, I increase the likelihood of a successful sale at a price that benefits both of us."
