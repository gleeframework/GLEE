"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is too high, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects a fair price considering both our interests."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob can continue to counteroffer and try to bring the price down further.  
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can still buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price is a significant compromise on my end and should reflect the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
