"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your perspective, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the value of my product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I am eager to find a solution that works for both of us. I am willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer $960,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price considering its value to me and your previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,6,
