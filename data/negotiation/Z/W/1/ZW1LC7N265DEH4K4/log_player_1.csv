While I'd ideally like to get more, accepting $920,000 is a good deal at this stage. Bob is clearly trying to get the best price, and continuing to push him risks him walking away.  It's better to secure a good profit now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to go with John's guaranteed $800,000."
