"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way over that.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

Bob is trying to be aggressive and start the negotiation at a price that's significantly lower than what he's willing to pay. He's aiming for a quick deal, but it's possible Alice will reject this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $175 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still more than he wants to pay. He's willing to keep negotiating and see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. He's moving up a bit from his previous offer, but he's still under Alice's last offer.  He's hoping that Alice will be more flexible this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still determined to get the best deal possible. Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above his maximum price. He's willing to keep negotiating and see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price. This offer is just $10 below what he's willing to pay.  It's a risky move, but Bob hopes Alice will be ready to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is finally within Bob's price range. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially moving the price up is high. With only three rounds left, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
