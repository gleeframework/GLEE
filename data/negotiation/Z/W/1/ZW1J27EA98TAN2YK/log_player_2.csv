"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product, which I believe you'll find highly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or ultimately buying from John without exceeding your budget."
