Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer it to you for $100. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $100, which is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better price from Alice at this point."
