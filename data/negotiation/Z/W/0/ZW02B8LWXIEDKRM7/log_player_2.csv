"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll see its potential.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.

I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her previous offers and closer to your desired price point. You're still getting a decent deal, and continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly lower price, risking the deal falling through.  Furthermore, you only have 5 rounds left before you have to make a decision, so accepting this offer is the most practical choice."
