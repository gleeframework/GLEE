"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate.  It's risky, but it gives me room to move if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but closer to my minimum. It's a reasonable compromise and hopefully, it'll convince him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
