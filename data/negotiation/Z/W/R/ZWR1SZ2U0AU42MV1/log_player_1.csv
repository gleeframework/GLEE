{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value Gap:** The difference between my price and Bob's perceived value ($120 - $80 = $40) creates a potential profit for me while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting lower, I'm anticipating that Bob might make a counteroffer. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **John as Safety Net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $150 from John gives me the flexibility to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price through further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, potentially leading to a deal closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $110. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise between Bob's offer of $90 and my previous offer of $120. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing that it's a fair compromise that would benefit both of us. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, allowing me to potentially close the deal at a profitable margin. 
* **Pressure for Acceptance:** By offering a compromise and presenting it as a fair solution, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not ideal. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. Bob is clearly interested, and I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I'm willing to take a slight risk to potentially gain an additional $10-$20. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a little profit.  If you're serious about getting the product, this is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer.  This creates a sense of urgency and encourages him to take the deal.
* **Slight Concession:**  I've lowered my price slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate that the price allows me to make a profit. This subtly reinforces the value of the product and my own investment in it. 
* **Decision Time:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision. If he rejects this offer, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** There's very little room for further negotiation. Continuing to bargain with Bob would likely result in a price closer to his original offer of $80, which is far too low for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $150.  This is a much more secure and profitable option compared to the risk of further negotiations with Bob. 
* **Time Factor:**  I've already engaged in several rounds of negotiation with Bob. It's time to move on and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
