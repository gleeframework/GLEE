"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $7,000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
