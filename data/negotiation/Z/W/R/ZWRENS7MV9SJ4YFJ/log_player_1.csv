Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's value leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than this amount."
