"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be quite valuable to you.  I'm thinking of an initial offer of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's a much lower price.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $17,000,  which I think is a fair offer considering its benefits.  What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $7,000, which I think is a reasonable offer.  It lets me acquire the product while reflecting my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $14,000? That's a substantial reduction on my initial price and reflects a willingness to compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute maximum is $7,500.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
