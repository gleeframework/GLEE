Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still giving me a significant profit.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $15,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,250.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit, and I'm concerned that further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth and potentially a lower offer from Bob.  It's also closer to my minimum than John's offer, making it the better choice for maximizing my profit."
