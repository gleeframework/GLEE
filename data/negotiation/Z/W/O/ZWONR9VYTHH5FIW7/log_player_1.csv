Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal for something you value so much!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $119, you're maximizing your potential profit. Bob gets the product for $1 less than his perceived value, making it a tempting deal for him to accept."
