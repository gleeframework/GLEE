"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $130 is way over Bob's budget of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. If that fails, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer of $90, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the range of what he's willing to pay. This allows for room to negotiate while still making it clear that he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He has a backup option with John for $100, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer to $105. This shows Alice he's willing to compromise while still staying within his budget.  If Alice doesn't accept, Bob can still buy from John."
