Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product for the best guaranteed price."
