{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy with it.  I'm hoping that by starting at a higher price, I can leave space for potential negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering $115 to Bob. This is a compromise from my previous offer. It's still above my minimum price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $112.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $112.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it seems like Bob is also firm on his price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120.  It's not ideal, but it's a better outcome than settling for a price lower than my minimum."
