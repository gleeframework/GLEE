"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit below your budget, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that balances the value you see in the product with the price you're willing to pay.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250, which is a good compromise and shows my seriousness about buying this product. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,250, Bob, but I'm still not sure that's enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I know this product holds. I'll offer it to you for $11,750. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $11,750 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to the value I know this product holds. I'll offer it to you for $12,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
