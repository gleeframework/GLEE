"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a good deal for both of us and ensures I don't lose too much.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $12500 is a bit high. How about we meet at $11000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
