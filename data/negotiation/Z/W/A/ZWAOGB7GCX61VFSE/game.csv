"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I consider its true value. This product offers substantial returns, and I'm confident it's worth a premium.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
