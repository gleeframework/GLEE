Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Sweet Spot:** Your goal is to find a price that earns you the most profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product ($150,000 profit for you) while leaving him with a potential gain of $50,000. 
* **Strong Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial for Bob.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you anticipate Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price for this deal.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
