Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still ensuring you get a better price than John's offer. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Starting at Bob's maximum value ($80) is too low and might make you seem desperate. A price closer to your desired outcome makes your offer appear more reasonable. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while maintaining a balance between attractiveness to Bob and your own minimum acceptable price."
