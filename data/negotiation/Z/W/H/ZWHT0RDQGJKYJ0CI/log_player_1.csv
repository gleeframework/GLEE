Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it still leaves a decent profit margin for me.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential gain:** While I could ask for more, a higher price increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  
* **Consider Bob's value:**  $1,300,000 is still $500,000 more than the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **Avoid John's offer:** By offering a competitive price, I aim to close the deal with Bob before I have to resort to John's offer, which would provide a guaranteed but less profitable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response and be prepared to counteroffer if needed, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,300,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my interests:** Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Potential for better outcome:**  While there's a risk that further negotiation might fail, I believe there's a better chance of achieving a more favorable price by counteroffering.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than $900,000 but lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise point that satisfies both our interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm trying to find a middle ground that allows for some negotiation while ensuring a reasonable profit for me.
* **Motivating Bob:** This offer provides a $200,000 discount from my previous offer, which might entice Bob to consider accepting. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While this offer is lower than my desired price, it's still much better than the $1,500,000 I'd get from John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has slightly increased his offer to $950,000, it's still far from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my interests:** My goal is to maximize my profit, and accepting this offer would be highly unfavorable.
* **Potential for better outcome:** I'm willing to risk further negotiation to see if I can achieve a more acceptable price. There's still a chance that Bob might increase his offer further.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than $950,000 but lower than my previous offer. I aim to find a compromise point that allows for a more profitable outcome than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,050,000. This represents a $50,000 increase from Bob's last offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm hoping to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us. 
* **Still Profitable:** This offer still provides a substantial profit for me, even though it's below my ideal price.
* **Avoiding John:**  While I would prefer a higher price, this offer is still better than selling to John for $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I will finalize the deal. If he rejects, I will need to assess whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not enough. The negotiation has been going back and forth for a while, and I'm starting to run out of time. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a better price, but there's a risk that we'll never reach an agreement. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me a significant profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John to ensure a guaranteed profit. I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and it's time to move on."
