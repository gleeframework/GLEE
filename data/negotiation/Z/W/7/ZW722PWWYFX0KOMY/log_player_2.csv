**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,150,000. This is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* While it's a better price than John's offer, it's still not within your budget constraints.
* Rejecting Alice's offer means you can negotiate with John or explore other options to find a better price."
