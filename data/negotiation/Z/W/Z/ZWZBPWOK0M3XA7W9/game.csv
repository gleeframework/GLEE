"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
