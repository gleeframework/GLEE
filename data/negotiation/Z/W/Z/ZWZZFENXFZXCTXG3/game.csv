"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's value to me is quite significant, and $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could we perhaps agree on $1,200,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still finding it difficult to meet that price. How about we land right in the middle at $1,125,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $1,075,000 as a final offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
