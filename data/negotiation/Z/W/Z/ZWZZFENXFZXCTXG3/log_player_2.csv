# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's value to me is quite significant, and $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could we perhaps agree on $1,200,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still finding it difficult to meet that price. How about we land right in the middle at $1,125,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings.
