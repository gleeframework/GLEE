Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he's more likely to accept than reject.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $80 (Bob's value) or lower leaves money on the table.
* **Below John's Offer:**  John's offer ($150) provides a safety net. Any price Bob accepts above $150 is a win.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $125 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and a compromise can be reached. 

This strategy aims for a price that is attractive to Bob while still being significantly profitable for Alice."
