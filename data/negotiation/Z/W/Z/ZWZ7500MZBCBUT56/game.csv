"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Let's split the difference -  how about $87.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's my final offer.",85.0,Bob,6,
