"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me, hoping to leave some room for negotiation and potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Let's split the difference -  how about $87.50?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $90. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $90.  I've already gone down quite a bit from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm happy with the price."
