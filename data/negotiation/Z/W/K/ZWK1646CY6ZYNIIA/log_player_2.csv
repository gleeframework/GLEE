# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $8,750 is enough to reflect the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $9,200? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to get close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $9,050, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

While he could continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a lower price, he has only one round left.  Alice's final offer of $9,050 is still higher than his target price of $8,000. 

Given the risk of not getting a better deal and the certainty of getting the product for $8,000 from John, Bob should buy from John to ensure he gets the product at his desired price."
