Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,300,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."

I'll reject Bob's offer again. He's stuck at $1,300,000, and I'm not going to budge. I'm confident I can get him to move closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

We've reached a stalemate. Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm concerned we're running out of time. To avoid further negotiation and secure a price closer to my value, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
