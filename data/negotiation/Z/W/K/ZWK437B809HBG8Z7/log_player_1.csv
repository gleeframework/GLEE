Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying well above your minimum price. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning that you'll list it publicly implies he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act."
