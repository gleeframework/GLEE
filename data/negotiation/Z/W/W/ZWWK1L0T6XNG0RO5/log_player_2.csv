"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120.  It's not worth accepting her offer. You should counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price point of $120. This is the price I'm willing to pay and it leaves no room for negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll move on to John as my price ceiling has been reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $120.  There's no guarantee she'll continue to lower the price, and further negotiation risks time and the possibility of her walking away.  John offers a guaranteed deal at my price ceiling, making him the better choice."
