Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've carefully considered its worth and, given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its significant value of $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice aims to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible while ensuring she gets more than John's offer ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer) while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is polite, professional, and highlights the product's value to Bob, justifying the price."
