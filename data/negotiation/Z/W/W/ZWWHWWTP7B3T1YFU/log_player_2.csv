Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go down to $13000 just yet. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13100. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's only $100 away from his last counteroffer, and he's getting closer to the price Alice is willing to accept. It's probably not worth risking further negotiation for a small price difference, especially with only 3 rounds left.  If he rejects, he's more likely to end up buying from John for $15,000."
