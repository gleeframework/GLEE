"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I see the value in the product, but $8,500 is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to accept $7,500 yet, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer $8,200. This is my best and final offer for now.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to maximize value here, Alice.  While $8,200 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget.  I'd be willing to finalize the deal right now for $7,750.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a win-win for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $7,750. I'll make one more concession and offer $8,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8100.0,Alice,7,
