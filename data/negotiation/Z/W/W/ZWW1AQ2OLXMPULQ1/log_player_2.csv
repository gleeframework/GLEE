"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
