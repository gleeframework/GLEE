"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $75, so how about $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
