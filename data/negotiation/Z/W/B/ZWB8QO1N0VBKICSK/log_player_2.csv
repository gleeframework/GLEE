"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.  
* **Reasonable Offer:**  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing Bob is serious about buying but also trying to secure a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for Alice to counter if she needs to, but it also gives Bob a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counter is higher:** Alice's offer increased to $9,500, which is closer to her original price point.
* **Still room for negotiation:** Bob still has room to negotiate as he's willing to pay up to $12,000. Rejecting allows for another counteroffer.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob might be able to secure a price closer to his ideal range by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is increasing his offer to show willingness to negotiate, but it's still below Alice's last offer.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $9,000 is a midpoint between Bob's previous offer and Alice's last offer, showing a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Potential for Acceptance:** This price may be acceptable to Alice, especially since it's closer to her desired value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Alice's offer of $9,600 is getting very close to Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It appears that Alice is unwilling to budge much further, suggesting further negotiation might not yield a significant price drop.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While buying from John is the most expensive option, it guarantees a purchase. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate, leaving Bob with no product and a wasted amount of time."
