"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120.  It's worth a lot more to you, so it's a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's a bit high but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it, would you be willing to do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get a higher price.  I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground here. By offering $110, I'm demonstrating flexibility but still holding firm on a price that is beneficial for me."
