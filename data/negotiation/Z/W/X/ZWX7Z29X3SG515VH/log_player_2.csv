"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120.  It's worth a lot more to you, so it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is a good deal, it's still above your target price of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it, would you be willing to do that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $110 is still within my budget and a good deal, especially considering Alice is already at a compromise.  Accepting the offer is the best way to ensure I get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
