Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I need to get closer to $10,000 for this. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can only go up to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
