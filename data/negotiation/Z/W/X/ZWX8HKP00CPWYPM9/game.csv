"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price a little higher. How about we meet at $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
