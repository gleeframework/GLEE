Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

While a higher price is still desirable, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting the $1,800,000 offer secures a significant profit above my minimum, making it a pragmatic choice at this stage."
