"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I believe it's a fantastic deal, let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $120, so you have room to bargain. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $105 for the product? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject again or you'll end up paying the full $120 to John. Accepting the $110 offer is a good compromise that saves you $10 compared to John's price."
