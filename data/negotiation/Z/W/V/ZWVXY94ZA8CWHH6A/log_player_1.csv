Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing a willingness to find common ground. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll be ready to switch to John if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer.  My goal is to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,100,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not completely shutting the door.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, but still comfortably above Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Framing:**  I'm still emphasizing the value for Bob (""great price"") and the fairness of my position (""fair profit"").
* **Open-Ended:** I'm inviting Bob to continue the dialogue with a question, hoping to spark further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't drop below my minimum price.
* If negotiations stall, I'll proceed to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's not ideal, it's a decent deal that allows me to sell the product without waiting further.  It's also important to consider that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a longer process, which might make selling to John a more attractive option. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and complete the transaction."
