"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
