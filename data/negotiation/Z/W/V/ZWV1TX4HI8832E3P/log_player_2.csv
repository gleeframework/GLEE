"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price of $1,100,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000. Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is still a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is better than the initial offer of $1,100,000, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which would be a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000. This is still a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, but it's getting close to his ""buy from John"" price.  At this point, $1,120,000 is a reasonable deal.  He's saving $80,000 compared to John's price and the negotiation with Alice seems to be stalling.  It's better to secure the product for a slightly higher price than risk going back and forth and potentially losing the deal altogether."
