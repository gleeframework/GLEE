"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I agree it's a good product, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're still a bit far apart on the price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
