Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly lower allows room to potentially earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $119 is just below your minimum and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This makes it seem like a good deal to Bob while still being highly profitable for you.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and highlights the ""special price"" to make the offer more enticing."
