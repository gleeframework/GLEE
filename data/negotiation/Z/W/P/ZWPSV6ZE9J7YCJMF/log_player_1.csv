Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without risking a rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $140 is our starting point, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, still landing us above our minimum.
* **Avoid Greed:** Offering it at $150 might feel tempting, but it leaves Bob with no incentive to buy and risks losing him as a customer."
