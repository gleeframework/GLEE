"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others might pay. I am offering it to you for $140, which I think strikes a fair balance between compensating me adequately and ensuring you get a great deal. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
