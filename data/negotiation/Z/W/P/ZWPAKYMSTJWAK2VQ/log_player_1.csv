Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $11,500 is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It doesn't directly threaten to sell to John, but it implies that you are open to other options. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizes your potential profit:** By starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, you have room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Keeps Bob engaged:**  A friendly tone and emphasis on value encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Provides flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can use the threat of selling to John as leverage in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why reject Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer is $1,500 lower than your minimum acceptable price. It's not worth selling the product to him at a loss. 
* **Why not sell to John yet:** You still have the opportunity to get closer to your desired price. 

**Next steps:** You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $10,750 represents a compromise - it's a significant drop from your initial offer but still above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  The message is positive and focuses on finding a solution. It acknowledges Bob's position while reaffirming the product's value.  

**Why this approach?**

* **Shows flexibility:** You're demonstrating willingness to negotiate, which can help maintain a positive relationship with Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While the price is closer to Bob's offer, it's still higher, allowing for further discussion. 
* **Prevents a hasty decision:** By not immediately accepting or rejecting, you keep the negotiation open and avoid missing a better deal."
