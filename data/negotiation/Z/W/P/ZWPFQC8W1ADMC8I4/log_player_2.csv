"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm asking $150 for it. It's a fantastic item that I think you'll really love! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $150 is far above your $80 limit and even above her own valuation. John offers the product at your maximum price, making it the best choice."
