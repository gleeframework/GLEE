"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is not feasible.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? This offer reflects the value I place on the product while recognizing its worth to you.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'd be willing to meet you at $750,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part while acknowledging the value of the product. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession.
