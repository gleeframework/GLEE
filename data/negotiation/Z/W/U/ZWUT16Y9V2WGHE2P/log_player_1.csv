{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're giving Bob room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** You're not giving away too much value upfront. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than your desired price:** You're aiming for more than $1,350,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is still above your minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **You want to try to get closer to your desired price:** By rejecting, you can counteroffer and potentially get closer to your $1,400,000 goal.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to create a counteroffer for Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,375,000?  That gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. "", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  You're demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $1,375,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for further negotiation:** This offer still leaves room for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can make this work for both of us. How about $1,360,000 for the product? This is a bit higher than my initial offer, but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:**  Bob's offer is just $15,000 below your previous counteroffer of $1,375,000.  
* **Above your minimum:**  $1,360,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject, there's a chance Bob might walk away, and you'd be forced to sell to John for a much lower price. 

**It's a good time to accept and secure a good deal!**"
