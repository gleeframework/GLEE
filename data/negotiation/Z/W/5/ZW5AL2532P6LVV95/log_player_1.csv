Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is higher than my minimum of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially settle for a price closer to my goal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like this is a good opportunity.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think."" This signals I'm willing to discuss the price further.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my understanding of his potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not quite there:**  While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum ($12,000), it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation. There's a chance Bob is genuinely interested and might be willing to go higher. 
* **No urgency to sell to John:** Since John will pay my absolute minimum, I have some flexibility to keep negotiating with Bob.

**Next steps:**  In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired $15,000. I'll aim to find a middle ground that makes both of us happy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my initial offer ($15,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($12,500).  This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like I'm genuinely trying to reach an agreement.
* **Positive and fair tone:** I'm using positive language like ""good starting point"" and ""fair price"" to keep the negotiation friendly and constructive.
* **Focus on value:**  By mentioning that it's ""a fair price for both of us,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product.

**Next steps:**  I'll wait to see how Bob responds to this counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12500. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $13,250 is just $250 away from my initial offer of $13,500. This is very close to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for a lower price. 
* **Value of the Agreement:**  It's important to remember that the goal is to get the best possible price, not to necessarily reach my absolute highest goal. This is a good deal, and it's worth securing it.

**Next Steps:**  I'll accept Bob's offer, finalizing the deal and earning a good profit."
