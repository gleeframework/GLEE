"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure I'd be happy with the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to offer $135.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident I would be happy with the product.",135.0,Bob,6,
