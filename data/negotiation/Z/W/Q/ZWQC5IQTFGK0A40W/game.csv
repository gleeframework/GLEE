"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1500000 to me. I believe it has tremendous potential for someone with your vision and expertise. While I can't disclose specifics without a signed NDA, I'm confident this could be a mutually beneficial investment. My asking price is $2000000, but I'm open to reasonable negotiations. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a win-win scenario.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
