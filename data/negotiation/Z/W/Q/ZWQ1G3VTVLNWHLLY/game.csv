"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $11000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10500? I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me here!",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer of $11500. I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $11250. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
