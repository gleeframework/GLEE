"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the price gap is still significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $975,000? This reflects a compromise from both sides.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $975,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
