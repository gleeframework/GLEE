"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still represents a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? That's a fair offer considering the value and allows us both to benefit.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. It's a compromise, and hopefully, we can close this deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to move up slightly to $1,300,000 to get this done today.  That's my final offer, as I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
