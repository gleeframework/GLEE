"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $800,000? This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. The product is worth that much, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. I'm willing to make one final compromise, let's meet in the middle at $790,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",780000.0,Bob,6,
