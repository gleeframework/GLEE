,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 seems a bit high for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $60 is way too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not selling for anything less than $120. Let's try to find a middle ground.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a stretch for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at around $80? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go below $100. This product is worth a lot more than $80, and I'm confident it will be worth your investment.  Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,5,
