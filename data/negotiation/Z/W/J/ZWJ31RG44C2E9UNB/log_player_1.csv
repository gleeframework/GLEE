"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer down in subsequent rounds. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also not willing to give it away for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $1,600,000 is a good price and it's above my minimum of $1,500,000. It's also higher than John's offer, so it's the best option for me at this point."
