Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,500,000 aims to secure a significant profit margin.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of desirability and urgency. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** This strategy assumes Bob highly values the product.  If you're uncertain about his eagerness, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. Having a clear understanding of your lowest acceptable price will be crucial if he counters your offer."
