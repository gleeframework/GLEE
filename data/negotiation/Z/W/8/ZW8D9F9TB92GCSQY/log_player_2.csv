"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better deal than John's offer of $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's more than her $8,000 valuation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and creates room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $9,000.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and continuing could risk Alice rejecting Bob's offer completely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
