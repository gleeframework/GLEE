Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  It also allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $9,000 is better than my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between our previous offers. I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to him, and it allows for a potential agreement without being too far from my desired outcome."
