While $16,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal. John is a solid backup, but I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Alice for another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

This is a good deal. While $16,000 is above my ideal price, it's still within my budget and only two rounds away from my absolute maximum. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
