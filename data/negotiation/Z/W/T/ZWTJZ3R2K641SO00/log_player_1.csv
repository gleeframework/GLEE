"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $12000?

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll try to counter with a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price that would make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'm getting closer to selling to John if we can't come to an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $12800?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

This is a good compromise. I'm getting close to my minimum and the risk of losing Bob entirely is too high.  I'll accept his offer."
