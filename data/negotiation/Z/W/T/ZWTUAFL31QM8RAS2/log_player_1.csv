"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price to give myself room to negotiate down. This strategy aims to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I will reject it and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

I've significantly lowered my asking price but kept it above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also reinforces the value of my product.  A price of $115 leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not able to go that high.  How about $95? That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to a reasonable price, $95 is still below my minimum. I'll reject and counter, but I need to start considering John as a backup if Bob won't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $95 isn't quite feasible for me, but I'm eager to make a deal. How about we split the difference and call it $105? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm above my $120 minimum but offering a clear compromise.  
* **""Final Offer"":** This adds a touch of urgency and signals that Bob needs to get closer to my price if he wants the product.
* **Considering John:** I'm getting close to accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't accept this round or offers something too low in the next."
