Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I understand it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $9,000.

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the direction we're heading, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,100. I'm willing to meet you at $9,150, which is just a small step back from our previous offer. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but in smaller increments.  Taking her down another $50 is unlikely, and risks her walking away. Accepting at $9,150 secures a savings of $850 compared to John's offer."
