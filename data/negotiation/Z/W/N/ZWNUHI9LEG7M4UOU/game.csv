"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I understand it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $9,000, which would be $9,250. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $9,100?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the direction we're heading, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,100. I'm willing to meet you at $9,150, which is just a small step back from our previous offer. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",9150.0,Alice,7,
