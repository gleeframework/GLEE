Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($30) while still ensuring Bob has an incentive to buy ($10 profit for him).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale at a good price and avoiding a rejection that would lead to a lower profit margin with John."
