"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum price.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still a good deal for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's even closer to your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
