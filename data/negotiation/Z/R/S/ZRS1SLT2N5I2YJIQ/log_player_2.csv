"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum price.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still a good deal for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob has a better deal available from John for $1,000,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's even closer to your offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, the negotiation has gone on for several rounds and it's unlikely Alice will come down further. Given that Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to take that offer rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
