Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth less than $14,000 to me. I would like to propose a price of $12,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe we could both be happy with this outcome."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick closer to my initial valuation. I propose a price of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $13,000 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer by continuing to negotiate."
