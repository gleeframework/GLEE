"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $85. I'm willing to sell it to you for $92.50.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $92.50 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $90. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair compromise.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still not comfortable with $90.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $87.50 is getting closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for less than $90. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $88.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",88.5,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price point. However, $88.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $86. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach a deal.",86.0,Bob,8,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88.50 and $86. I can offer it to you for $87. I hope this is the compromise we've been looking for.",87.0,Alice,9,
