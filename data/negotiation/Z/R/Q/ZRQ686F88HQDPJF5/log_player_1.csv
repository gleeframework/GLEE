Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $145 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and encouraging. It emphasizes the deal being good for Bob, making him more likely to consider it.
* **Flexibility:**  The price is close to my minimum value of $150, allowing for some negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $150, so I can walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value of $150, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay $150.  I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob, or if negotiations fail, I can sell to John.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $130 is tempting, I need to stay closer to $140 to make this work. How about we split the difference at $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** Instead of simply rejecting Bob's offer, I'm making a counter-offer with a reason. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a fair price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $135 (the midpoint between my last offer of $145 and Bob's offer of $130)  shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** The message remains positive, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation and find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The offer is still above my minimum value of $150, but it demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we meet at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay under $130 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $132 is only $18 away from my minimum value of $150. This is a significant compromise from his previous offers.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away. He's already stated his intention to do so.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing negotiations could lead to more rounds and potentially a lower price.  Accepting now ensures a sale.
* **Backup Option:** I still have John as a backup buyer, providing a safety net if future negotiations with other buyers become necessary. 

While $132 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable price considering the risk of losing the deal entirely."
