"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $11,000 feels fair. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, given my budget constraints. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,875.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground. What do you say?",9875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to maximize your profit, but $10,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, which is almost your offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. This would be a good deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",9900.0,Bob,6,
