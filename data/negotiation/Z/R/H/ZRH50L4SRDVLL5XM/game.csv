"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm very interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $8,800? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it happen.",8800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really close to a deal!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $8,200.  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",8200.0,Bob,6,
