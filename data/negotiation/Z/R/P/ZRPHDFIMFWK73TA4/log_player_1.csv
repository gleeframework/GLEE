Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $13,000 is a decent price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $13,500, which is only $500 less than my last counteroffer. At this point, I think it's best to accept. It's getting close to my minimum value and I'm not sure how much more I can push Bob."
