Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning that it's a ""great deal"" to emphasize the potential value for Bob. 

**Important note:**  This is just the first offer. I'm prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response and my understanding of his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it. While it's tempting, I'm hoping to get a slightly better price.  Would you consider $8000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Since I'm not losing any money, and it's faster to close the deal, it's best to accept his offer.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better price in further negotiations, and time is valuable."
