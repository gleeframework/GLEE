Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident we can do better. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get closer to my target price with Bob.  I'll try to meet him halfway with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're both trying to find a fair price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise: I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is very close to my target price, and it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000.  It seems like Bob is serious about getting this product, and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
