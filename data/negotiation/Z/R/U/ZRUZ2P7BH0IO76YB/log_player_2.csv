Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}

This counteroffer increases your price slightly, while still being lower than Alice's offer and below your maximum price point of $12,000. It shows Alice you are willing to compromise but still want a good deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You've been negotiating for a while, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to meet your price. Since you have a backup option with John at $12,000, it's better to go with that option than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially end up paying even more."
