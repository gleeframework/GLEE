"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $700,000 is a good price, but he can likely get it lower. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $650000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $650,000 is a better price than her initial offer, he can still try to negotiate further and potentially get an even lower price. It's worth seeing if he can get closer to his desired price of $600,000 before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $650,000 is still a bit too high for me right now.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $625,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 625000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $630000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice has come down to $630,000, which is only $30,000 more than his last counteroffer.  It's unlikely he'll be able to get a lower price, and it's a much better deal than buying from John for $800,000."
