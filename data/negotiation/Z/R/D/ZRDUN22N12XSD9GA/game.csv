"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe it's a bit lower than the market value, but I'm willing to make a compromise. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think $13000 is still a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider $12200? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay a premium for the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,5,
