"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $9500 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $9750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9200 is closer to my price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer. Let's split the difference - how about $9450? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",9450.0,Alice,5,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9300. Can you consider my offer?,9300.0,Bob,6,
