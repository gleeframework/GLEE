{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, knowing that my minimum is $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention that the product is ""worth a lot to me,"" subtly suggesting its potential value to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away.
* **John as Safety Net:** I'll always keep John in mind as a backup buyer, knowing I can sell to him for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There's a chance I can get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  Rejecting gives me the power to make a counteroffer, putting me back in control of the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired price point.
* **Monitoring John:** I'll keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $9,750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing $9,750, which is a compromise between my original price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect, making it sound like I'm being reasonable and not just trying to squeeze every last dollar out of him.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone, keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or accept his offer, always remembering John's offer as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $9750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. There's still a chance I can get a bit more from Bob.
* **Negotiation Tactics:** By rejecting his offer, I can keep the negotiation going and potentially push him to a price closer to $9,500. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not in a hurry to sell, so I can afford to be a bit more demanding and see if I can get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground between our current positions. 
* **John as Safety Net:** I'll always keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if things don't work out with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,200 is closer to my price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer. Let's split the difference - how about $9,450? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9450}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $9,450, exactly in the middle between my last offer ($9,750) and Bob's latest offer ($9,200). This shows a willingness to meet him halfway while still holding out for a slightly higher price.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing ""a good compromise"" to make the offer sound fair and reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going smoothly. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll decide my next step. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll carefully consider whether to make another counteroffer or accept his offer, always keeping John's offer as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9300. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,300 is only $100 below my minimum acceptable price of $9,400. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Pushing for more might risk losing Bob altogether, and then I'd be forced to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further might take more time and effort, and I might not get a significantly better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept the Offer:**  I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,300 and finalize the sale. This is a good outcome, as it's very close to my minimum and avoids the risk of getting a lower price from John."
