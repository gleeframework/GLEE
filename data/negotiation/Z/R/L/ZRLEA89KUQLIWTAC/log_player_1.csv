Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and I know Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:**  While I have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, closing the deal quickly with Bob at a higher price is more advantageous."
