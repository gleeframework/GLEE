# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While the product is worth more to Bob than Alice, Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
