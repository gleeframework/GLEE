"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and well above my minimum asking price. Let me know your thoughts!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $11,000? That would still leave you a nice profit, and it's a good compromise for both of us.
