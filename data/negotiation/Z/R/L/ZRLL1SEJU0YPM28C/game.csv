"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and well above my minimum asking price. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $11,000? That would still leave you a nice profit, and it's a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair price that still gives you a significant profit. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
