Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. Perhaps we could agree on $12,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, but this is her ""final offer."" It's clear she's unlikely to go lower. Since your maximum price is $8,000 and John is offering it at that price, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
