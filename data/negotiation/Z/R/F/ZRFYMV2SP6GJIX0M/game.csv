"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me right now, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,950,000. This still reflects the immense worth this product holds.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,725,000. This is my final offer.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
