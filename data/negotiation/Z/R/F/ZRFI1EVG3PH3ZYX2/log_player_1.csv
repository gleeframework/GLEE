"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, but it allows for some wiggle room in negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. It's also above my minimum value of $8,000, so I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a bit more, $9,200 is a good price, especially considering I only have 6 rounds left.  It's above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
