Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,500 is higher than my minimum price of $12,000, I'll choose option (1).
