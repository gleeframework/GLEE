"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you see in it. My budget is quite limited, so I would like to propose a price of $500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $500000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1200000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I value the product, but my budget constraints are significant. I am willing to increase my offer to $750000. This still leaves me within my financial limits while showing respect for the value you place on the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to stretch your budget. However, $750000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I've carefully considered your last offer, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I must stay within my budget. I am prepared to offer $900000. This price reflects a compromise that respects both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1000000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
