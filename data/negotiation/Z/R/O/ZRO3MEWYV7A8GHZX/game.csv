"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1025000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1025000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $975000. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and your previous offers.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925000, just like I offered before. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you think of a way to make it work?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $925000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $955000. It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",955000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $955000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $955000, so I'm counteroffering at $940000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",940000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but it's my last offer. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,9,
