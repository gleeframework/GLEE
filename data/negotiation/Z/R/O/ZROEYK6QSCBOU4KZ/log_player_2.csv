Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $15,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should still reject the offer. He can likely get the product for closer to his budget.  $15,000 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $13,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's getting closer to his budget, but there's still room to negotiate. He can likely get the price lower with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I'm willing to pay a little more.  But $14,250 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $13,750 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting close.  While I appreciate your offer of $13,750, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round, as I have another interested buyer who's ready to purchase at my asking price.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is clearly pushing to get as close to her desired price as possible, and it's not likely that she'll go lower than $14,000. While $14,000 is a better deal than her initial price, it's still outside of Bob's ideal budget. By purchasing from John, Bob can get the product for his desired price and save himself the hassle of further negotiation."
