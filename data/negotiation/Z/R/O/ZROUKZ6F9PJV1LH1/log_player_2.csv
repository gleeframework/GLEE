Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know you'll find extremely valuable.  I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable number. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target.  He'll continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still not in my best interest. Let's meet in the middle at $1,087,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a reasonable profit for me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is still trying to get a better price. While Alice's offer is getting closer to what Bob wants, he can still potentially get a lower price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,085,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been negotiating hard and has gotten the price down significantly.  Accepting the offer at $1,085,000 is a good deal for Bob and saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, it's not clear if he would be able to get a lower price, and there is a risk that Alice might walk away from the deal."
