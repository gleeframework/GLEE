"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy. If he outright rejects a price significantly higher than his perceived value, it might be better to move to John sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $120 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he might be willing to go higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find something that works for both of us.  Could you meet me at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. It's a significant drop from my initial offer but still keeps me above my absolute minimum. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This price will gauge Bob's seriousness. If he's willing to go above his perceived value, we can likely make a deal. If he's completely stuck at $120, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close Enough:**  Bob's offer of $140 is above my absolute minimum of $150. While I could push for the full $150, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down and having to sell to John anyway. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose time and end up with the same amount."
