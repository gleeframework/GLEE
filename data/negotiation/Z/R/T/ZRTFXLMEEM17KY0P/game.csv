"I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
