{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price point slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. This strategy balances the need for a high profit with the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price and avoiding the need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, there's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is still too low for me.  I've already lowered my price considerably, and another negotiation round is unlikely to get me closer to my target of $10,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure a guaranteed sale with John."
