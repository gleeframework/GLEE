"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* There are more rounds available, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* Bob's message is polite and acknowledges Alice's initial offer, but emphasizes his desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $12,000 is below what I can accept. Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm willing to go to $12,500.  This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
