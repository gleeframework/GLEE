Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value of $100, giving me some room to negotiate. It's also a reasonable starting point, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he thinks it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $142 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value of $100, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer."
