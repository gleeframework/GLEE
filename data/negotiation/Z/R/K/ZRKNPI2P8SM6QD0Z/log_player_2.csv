"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Since you are aiming to save as much money as possible, it's better to reject Alice's first offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $110 is closer to your target, it's still higher than your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still only able to offer $107. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about $109?  I'm really hoping to make a deal with you, so let's find a price we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has come down to $109, which is just $2 above your desired price and a better deal than buying from John for $120.  Accepting her offer is the most financially advantageous choice at this point."
