"Alice, your offer is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident this is a fair price given its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that we're making progress. Your willingness to increase your offer is encouraging.  To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to accept $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
