**Reasoning:** 

Bob has shown he is unwilling to budge past $950,000.  We are getting dangerously close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Rather than risk him going even lower, or failing to reach a deal at all, it's more profitable to cut our losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
