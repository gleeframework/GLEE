"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $950,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $975,000 is slightly out of my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on the price. This product represents a significant investment, and I believe $965,000 is my final offer.  I'm confident you won't find this kind of value elsewhere.",965000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that similar products are available for less than what you're asking. With that in mind, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $955,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",955000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been very accommodating so far, but your research seems flawed. This product is unique and not comparable to others on the market.  My absolute final offer is $960,000. Take it or leave it.",960000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your clarification about the uniqueness of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your latest offer. I would like to propose one last time at $950,000. I hope this allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,8,
