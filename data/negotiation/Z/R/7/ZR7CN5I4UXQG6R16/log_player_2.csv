"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a price that's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and also less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
