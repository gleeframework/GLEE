"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll try to get closer to my target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since I'm willing to pay $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be realistic here, but $10,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. I hope we can reach a deal soon."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,000 is still above my budget.  While I could keep negotiating, I'm concerned we're getting close to the end of the allotted rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the product entirely. Since John is offering the product for my target price of $8,000, I'm going to go ahead and buy it from him to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
