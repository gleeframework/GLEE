"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your Maximum Willingness to Pay:** $1,500,000
* **John's Price:** $1,500,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the guaranteed savings of $300,000 is a better choice in this scenario."
