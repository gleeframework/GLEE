"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'm selling and I think you'd be interested. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to establish a good rapport with Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to show I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while giving me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm interested in selling, I'm not willing to give up that much profit.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing I'm willing to compromise by lowering my price from $150 to $130.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer – a ""fair compromise"" – to make it sound more reasonable to Bob. 
* **Openness:** I'm still open to further negotiation by ending with a question, inviting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I have two options now: 

* **Accept:** Selling for $110 would be better than nothing, but it's not ideal.
* **Reject:** I have a chance to potentially get closer to my minimum price by continuing to negotiate. 

Given that I have 6 more rounds and John is offering $120, I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob. It's possible I can get him to come up to $120 or even a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  $110 is still a bit low for me, but I'm really trying to make this work.  Would you be willing to go up to $115? It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:** I start by acknowledging Bob's perspective, showing that I'm listening and trying to understand his position. 
* **Small Increment:** I'm proposing a small increase to $115, making it seem like a minor adjustment to close the gap. 
* **Emphasis on Deal:** I highlight the need to reach a deal, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, aiming to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $115 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115. How about $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $112.50 is getting closer to my minimum price of $120, but it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, but I also want to keep the negotiation open. Since I have 4 rounds left and John is offering $120, I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $112.50 is a bit too low for me, but I'm really trying to make this work.  Could we compromise at $117.50? It's a small adjustment from my last offer and closer to your price."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:** I acknowledge Bob's increased offer, showing I'm recognizing our progress.
* **Small Increment:** I'm offering a small increase from my previous offer, making it seem like a minor adjustment.
* **Compromise:**  I use the word ""compromise"" to emphasize that I'm meeting halfway.
* **Urgency:** I re-emphasize the desire to make the deal work.

This strategy aims to push Bob closer to my minimum price of $120, keeping the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $117.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $117.50. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum of $120.  I have two rounds left, and John is offering $120, which is my safety net.  It's worth taking a risk and seeing if I can push Bob to accept my minimum price or even a bit higher. There's still a chance that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob than with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $115 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $119?  It's only a small difference, and it gets us very close to a deal.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm clearly stating this is my final offer to create pressure on Bob.
* **Small Difference:** I'm emphasizing the small gap between our offers to make it seem like a minor hurdle.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm highlighting the proximity to a deal, reinforcing the idea that it's almost finalized.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

By offering $119, I'm trying to convince Bob that it's a good deal for him while still getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a gamble, but I have one more round left to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $119 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $119. How about $117? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $117 is still below my minimum of $120. I'm not willing to sell for less than what I consider fair, and I've reached the final round. It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John, ensuring I get at least my minimum price.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a higher price, I'm satisfied with securing a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
