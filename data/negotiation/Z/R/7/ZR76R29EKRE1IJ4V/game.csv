"Hi Bob, I have a great product I'm selling and I think you'd be interested. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? That's a fair compromise, I think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Can you meet me there?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  $110 is still a bit low for me, but I'm really trying to make this work.  Would you be willing to go up to $115? It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $115 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115. How about $112.50?",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $112.50 is a bit too low for me, but I'm really trying to make this work.  Could we compromise at $117.50? It's a small adjustment from my last offer and closer to your price.",117.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $117.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $117.50. How about $115?",115.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $115 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $119?  It's only a small difference, and it gets us very close to a deal.  This is my final offer.",119.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $119 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $119. How about $117?",117.0,Bob,10,
