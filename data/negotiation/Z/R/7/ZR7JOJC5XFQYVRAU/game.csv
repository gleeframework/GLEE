"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you'd like to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to do that just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we compromise at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. To be honest, $1,050,000 is really the highest I can go. If you're willing to come down a bit more, I think we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000 was a bit too high, but I can do $1,060,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this product.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I can tell we both want to make this deal happen.  How about we split the difference and close this out at $1,055,000?",1055000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I can do $1,060,000, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle of that number, at $1,057,500. That's the best I can do.",1057500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,052,500.  I need to leave some room for profit as well.  What do you say, can we wrap this up?",1052500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,052,500, Bob. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,052,500 and $1,060,000, which would be $1,056,250. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1056250.0,Alice,9,
