Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal, what do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for the product. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, I know John is ready to buy at that price. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I'd rather secure the sale with John than risk further negotiation."
