{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $175, which is way above his budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

This counteroffer sets the price at your maximum acceptable value. Since Alice is motivated to sell, it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her first, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, higher than your ideal price but lower than Alice's offer. It shows you are willing to negotiate while staying within your budget."
