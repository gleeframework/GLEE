Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and engaging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Intriguing Value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob to make him more interested in buying.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** By starting high, I have a greater chance of selling at a price closer to my ideal.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's reaction will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product.
* **Maintain Control:** By offering first, I establish myself as the seller and control the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is above my minimum value of $100, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good profit.
* **Reiterate value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the fairness of the new price to justify my position.
* **Maintain control:**  I'm still leading the negotiation by offering a counteroffer, not accepting Bob's offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly settle at $125? That would be within my budget and still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum value of $100 and is a good deal for me considering he is willing to pay more than what John would.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and it's likely further negotiation won't yield a significantly better offer.  Therefore, it makes sense to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
