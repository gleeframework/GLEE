"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price, and I'm comfortable with that.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Alice walk away."
