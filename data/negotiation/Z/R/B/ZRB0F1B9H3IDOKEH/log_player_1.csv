"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  However, if he rejects outright, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $950,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than his initial counteroffer."
