Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $115 leaves some space for potential counter-offers while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
