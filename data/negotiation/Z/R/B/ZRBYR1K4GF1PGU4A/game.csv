"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product is worth significantly less to me than your asking price.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
