"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher, but still competitive. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's close this deal!",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that's still a bit above your budget, but I think it's a good compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
