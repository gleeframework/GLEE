"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher, but still competitive. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $1,075,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is very close to his limit, but he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth trying for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that's still a bit above your budget, but I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,050,000, which is the same price Bob offered in round 2 and was rejected. There's a strong chance they will keep going back and forth, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $1,050,000. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it's a better deal to buy from John now.  There's a risk that continuing with Alice will lead to a stalemate or a worse deal than John's offer."
