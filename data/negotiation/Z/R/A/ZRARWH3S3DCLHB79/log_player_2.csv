"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $13,000.  Alice's offer is above the product's worth to her ($12,000), indicating room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point. This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate if she's willing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above the product's value to her, and slightly higher than Bob's initial offer.  Bob should continue to negotiate.  There's still potential to reach a price closer to $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer to $13,000, which is closer to Alice's last offer but still below her desired price. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position to potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is close to Bob's last offer, and while still slightly above his ideal price, it's significantly lower than what he'd pay from John.  Accepting the offer at $13,750 saves Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John for $15,000 outweighs the potential savings at this point."
