Round 2
Bob's offer:

However,  $1,050,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. To move this forward, I can go down to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,025,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,100,000 based on his negotiation pattern. Accepting his $1,025,000 offer secures a significant profit compared to John's $800,000."
