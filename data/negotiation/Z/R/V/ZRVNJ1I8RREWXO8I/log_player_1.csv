"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for John:**  This price is still within a range where I'd be happy to sell to Bob, but it's high enough that if he rejects, I can consider selling to John.
* **First move advantage:**  By setting the initial price, I establish a starting point and gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, giving me time to explore options. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While John's offer of $10,000 is acceptable, I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $15,000 to $12,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose out on profit. 
* **Testing the waters:** I'm seeing if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.
* **John's offer is a better option:**  Since I'm not willing to go below my minimum, selling to John for $10,000 is a safer bet at this point.
* **Time pressure:** We're already halfway through the rounds, and I don't want to risk running out of time with Bob.  

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, John's offer provides a guaranteed profit, and I'm not confident that Bob will come closer to my minimum in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One last attempt:**  Since I rejected Bob's offer in Round 4, I want to make one last attempt to get closer to my minimum value.
* **Small compromise:**  I'm lowering my price to $11,000, which is only $1,000 above my minimum. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Time pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, time is running out, and I need to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be more inclined to sell to John to avoid risking losing out on a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 finally meets my minimum value. 
* **No further room for negotiation:** I'm unlikely to get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit without risking further negotiation.

While I could continue to try and get a higher price, the risk of losing out on this guaranteed profit is too high."
