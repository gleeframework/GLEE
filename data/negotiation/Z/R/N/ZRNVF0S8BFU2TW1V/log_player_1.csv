{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me ($100) to give me some room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a good deal to make Bob feel like he's getting a bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I can get from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price of $100. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to sell the product at a loss. It's better to sell to John at $100 and secure a profit."
