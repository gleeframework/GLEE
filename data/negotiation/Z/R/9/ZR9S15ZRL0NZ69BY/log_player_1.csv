Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  I've highlighted that the price is fair, considering the value to Bob, which might encourage him to accept.
* **Flexibility:**  I've included a clear path for further negotiation, giving Bob an opportunity to make a counteroffer if he feels the price is too high. 
* **Safety Net:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000. This would still be a significant profit for you and a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,100,000 is still a profit for me, it's significantly lower than the price I'm aiming for.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can get a better price than Bob's offer.  
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John is my fallback option, but I'm not desperate yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable profit. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting that this price is a ""good deal"" for both of us, making it seem like a fair and equitable solution.
* **Setting a Clear Deadline:** I'm setting a clear expectation that this is my final counteroffer, which could motivate Bob to accept. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out if Bob decides to reject."
