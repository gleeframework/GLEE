Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction and a testament to my desire to see this work for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this and I want to find a solution. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $950,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower than her last offer of $950,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000, your maximum budget, rather than risk Alice not budging further and potentially losing out on the deal entirely."
