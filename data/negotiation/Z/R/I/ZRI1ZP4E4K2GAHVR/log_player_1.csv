Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $14,000 is a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and a solid return on the product.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks a stalemate. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potentially losing John's offer.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we're already close to our fallback option."
