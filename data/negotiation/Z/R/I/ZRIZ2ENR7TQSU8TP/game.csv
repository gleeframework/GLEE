,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $12200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go down to $11000, which is the lowest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $11000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to know that you're serious about buying the product. I'll offer it to you for $11500, and if you accept, I'll throw in a bonus package worth $500. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to throw in a bonus package, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11250. If you're willing to accept that, I'll take the product and the bonus package.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I'll tell you what - I'll throw in the bonus package worth $500, and I'll give you a 1% discount on the product price. That brings the total to $11395. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll seal the deal. What do you think?",11395.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to throw in the bonus package and discount, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $11300, but no higher. If you're willing to accept that, I'll take the product and the bonus package.",11300.0,Bob,10,
