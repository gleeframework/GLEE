"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product offers. I believe it's a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant investment for me and represents the maximum I can realistically pay. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
