Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal could work are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy:**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the substantial benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but within reason:** $1,450,000 starts the negotiation significantly above Bob's valuation but still leaves you room to potentially come down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the price fairly.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move. Bob might:

* **Accept:** Great! You get a fantastic price.
* **Reject:** You move on to John and secure your minimum.
* **Counter-offer:** This is where the real negotiation begins. You'll need to assess his counter-offer and decide whether to adjust your price or walk away."
