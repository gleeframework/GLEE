"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110?

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, which would be $95. Would you be willing to consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $97.50. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive move and offer it to you for $108. I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's getting closer to the price I'm willing to accept.",108.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final push, and I'm offering the product to you for $115. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",115.0,Alice,9,
