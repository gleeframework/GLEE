"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a quick and smooth transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but $850,000 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering $860,000. This price is a good balance between our desired outcomes, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still looking to negotiate, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the point where I might consider other offers. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from you. I'm now offering the product to you for $880,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to meet me at this price or walk away.",880000.0,Alice,5,
