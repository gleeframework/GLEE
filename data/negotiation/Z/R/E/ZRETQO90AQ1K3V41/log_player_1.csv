Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Provides value to Bob:**  $115 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $120.
* **Offers a profit for you:** You'll make a profit of $15, which is better than selling to John for $100.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob doesn't accept, you can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $100.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your desired profit margin:**  Selling for $90 would result in a loss.
* **Potentially negotiate a better price:** By rejecting, you show Bob that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away. This could lead to him raising his offer.
* **Explore the option of selling to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you can still sell to John for $100, ensuring you don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and it leaves you some room to save."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from $105. I'm thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price:**  While $95 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your $100 minimum.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant improvement:** Bob has shown a strong desire to stay below $100, and further counteroffers may only lead to an extended negotiation without a guarantee of a higher price.
* **Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees you a profit, which is more reliable than hoping for a better offer from Bob.

This decision prioritizes securing a guaranteed profit over the possibility of a slightly higher price through continued negotiation."
