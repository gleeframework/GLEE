Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, as it's a reasonable starting point that gives me some room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105, which is still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my original offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is only offering $95, which is still below my minimum threshold. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to continue negotiating endlessly. I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
