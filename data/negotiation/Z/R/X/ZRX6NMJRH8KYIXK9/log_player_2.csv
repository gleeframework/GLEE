"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth that much to you and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your needs. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $8,500 would be a loss. You can get the same product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice in this situation."
