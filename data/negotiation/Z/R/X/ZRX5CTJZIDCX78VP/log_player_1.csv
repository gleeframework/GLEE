Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still too far apart. Bob is moving up slowly, but we have time to negotiate further.  We'll aim to counter closer to his offer while still staying above our minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $825,000 is a good value for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $800,000, so I'm offering $775,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.

We're getting close, but we're still leaving money on the table. Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to his true valuation. Let's push a bit further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's close this deal.  How about $800,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, we're pushing Bob to his maximum perceived value.  Here's why this is a strong strategy:

* **Anchoring:** We've consistently kept our offers above his, establishing a higher perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds left, Bob understands this is a serious offer. 
* **Limited Flexibility:**  By stating it's our final offer, we signal we're unlikely to go lower.

If Bob rejects this, we'll still have a few rounds to consider whether to accept a slightly lower offer or go with John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
