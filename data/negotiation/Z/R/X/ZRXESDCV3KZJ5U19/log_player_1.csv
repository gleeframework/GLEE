Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Please let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, our goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below this is pointless.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **High Anchor:** This price sets a high anchor, potentially leading Bob to perceive a lower counter-offer as a better deal than he initially might. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid him rejecting it outright."
