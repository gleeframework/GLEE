"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to signal that I'm open to negotiation if he's not satisfied with the initial offer. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise quickly without pushing Bob away immediately. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $12,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I would like to propose a lower price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value is Still High:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still higher than his perceived value of $8,000, indicating potential for further negotiation. 
* **Early in the Process:**  We're only in round 2. It's too early to sell to John, especially since Bob's offer is within the range I'm aiming for.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer in the next round, potentially getting closer to my desired price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can keep the negotiation going, increase my chances of getting a better price, and avoid settling for less than I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer with Reasoning:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer outright but providing a counter-offer with a logical justification. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining my desired price point.
* **Midpoint Compromise:**  $9,750 is the midpoint between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,500. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize ""fair for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to see the value in accepting my offer.

This approach aims to bridge the gap between our current positions and potentially lead to a quick agreement. I'm still keeping in mind my fallback option of selling to John, but I'm trying to close the deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. This price is reasonable and still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my desired price of $9,750, and it's within a range that's acceptable considering my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We're in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, I'm trying to maximize my profit by getting as close to my target as possible.

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good price and close the deal, minimizing the risk of having to negotiate further or sell to John for less profit."
