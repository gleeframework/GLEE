"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you wanting to sell the product to me. However, $130 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going down to $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",135.0,Alice,3,
