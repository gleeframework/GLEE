"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that holds significant worth for you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, which allows for a considerable profit margin for you. Consider this a mutually beneficial deal. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,000,000. The choice is yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though Alice's product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, she's offering it for $1,100,000. This is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. 
* **Save money:** Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $100,000 compared to buying from John."
