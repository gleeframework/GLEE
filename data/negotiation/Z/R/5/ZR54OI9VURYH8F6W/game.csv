"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This reflects the product's worth to me and allows for some negotiation room.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and it allows us to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
