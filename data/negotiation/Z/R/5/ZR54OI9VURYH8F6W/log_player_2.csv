"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob, as his maximum budget is $1,200,000. 
* There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* Buying from John immediately would be a worse outcome since it's the highest price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This reflects the product's worth to me and allows for some negotiation room."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point, but it's getting closer. 
* Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can push for a lower price. There's still room for compromise. 
* Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome, as Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
