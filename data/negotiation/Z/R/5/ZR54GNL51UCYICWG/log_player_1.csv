I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also aware that I can always go down if Bob counteroffers."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a compromise point with Bob."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $12,800 is a good deal considering I can sell it to John for $12,000. It's worth it to secure the deal."
