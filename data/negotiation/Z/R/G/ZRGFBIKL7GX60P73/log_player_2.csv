"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might encourage her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $8,000. If she doesn't, you still have the option to buy from John for $15,000."
