"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  The product is worth more to him, and I have several rounds to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer a bit more, accepting this offer will allow me to close the deal and get a decent profit.  The risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a failed deal, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
