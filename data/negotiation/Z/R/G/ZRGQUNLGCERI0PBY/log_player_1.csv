"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially start a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $175 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I'm willing to accept.
* **More negotiation room:**  Rejecting his offer gives me an opportunity to counter with a higher price and try to get closer to my desired value.
* **Time is on my side:** I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $175 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $185? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 185} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""investment"" to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $185 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $180 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $180 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  With only 6 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a higher price.
* **Risk of selling to John:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away and having to sell to John for $150.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's close to my minimum, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit."
