Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit above my initial budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However,  $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,150,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While his offer is still below my minimum, we are getting closer. I'll counteroffer again to try and bridge the gap further."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk he'll walk away.  Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit."
