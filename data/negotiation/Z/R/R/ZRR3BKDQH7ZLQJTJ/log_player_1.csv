"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000.  I think you'll find this a very fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay somewhere around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While the product looks great, $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. How about we settle on $14,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be totally honest, my absolute limit for this is $12,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  It's a great product, and I'd be happy to buy it from you at that price.
