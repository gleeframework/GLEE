"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000.  I think you'll find this a very fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's in my best interest to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay somewhere around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than my actual budget. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and potentially secure a much better deal.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** By starting low, I'm trying to understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. Her response will give me valuable information for future rounds. 
* **John as Backup:** I always have the option of going to John if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well. This gives me leverage and allows me to walk away from a bad deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Alice moved from $20,000 to $16,000, it's still significantly higher than my target price and what I'm willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I still have time and the option of going to John. This allows me to push for a better deal with Alice.
* **Targeting a Middle Ground:**  I'll aim for a counter-offer around $11,000 - $12,000 in the next round, trying to find a compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While the product looks great, $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer to $11,500, signaling to Alice that I'm serious about purchasing but still aiming for a price within my budget.
* **Compromise:** My offer shows a willingness to compromise while remaining firm on not exceeding my spending limit.
* **Justification:** I've subtly reminded Alice of my budget constraints without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice is definitely coming down, but $14,000 is still $2,000 more than I can get it from John.
* **Time Remaining:**  I have five rounds left, which is enough time to try and negotiate further.
* **Final Push:** I'll make one more counteroffer close to my limit. If Alice doesn't budge, I'll take John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be totally honest, my absolute limit for this is $12,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  It's a great product, and I'd be happy to buy it from you at that price."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my best and final offer. I've been transparent about my budget and my willingness to buy at $12,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I've conveyed a sense of urgency, indicating that this is my last offer, and I'm ready to buy immediately if she accepts.
* **John as Backup:** I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice rejects this offer."
