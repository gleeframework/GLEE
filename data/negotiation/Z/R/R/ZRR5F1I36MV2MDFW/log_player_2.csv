"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still a significant amount. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's a good chance she might be willing to come down a bit to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point, and $750,000 is a significant saving compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or me wasting more time is high. Accepting this offer is a good compromise that secures the product at a favorable price."
