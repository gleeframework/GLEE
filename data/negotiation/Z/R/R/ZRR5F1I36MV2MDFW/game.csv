"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
