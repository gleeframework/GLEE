"Bob, I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
