"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'll sell it to you for $110. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer ($110):** While this is lower than Alice's value ($120), it's still more than your maximum budget of $80.
* **John's Offer ($80):** John offers the product at your target price.

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John's deal."
