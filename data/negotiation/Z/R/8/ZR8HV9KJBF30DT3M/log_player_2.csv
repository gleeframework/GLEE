"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $800000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering a good deal at $700,000, but there's potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I do appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given the value it holds for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $675000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, offering $675,000.
* **Value for Bob:** This price is still below Bob's maximum value of $800,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, the risk of further negotiation is higher. 
* **John's Offer:**  Buying from John for $800,000 is a worse deal than accepting Alice's current offer.

Accepting the offer at $675,000 allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
