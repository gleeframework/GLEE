The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal that's closer to your budget. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price.  He should continue to try and push for a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll sell the product to you for $11250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, the price is very close to Bob's ideal. While he could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. Accepting the offer for $11,250 saves Bob $3,750 compared to buying from John, making it a good deal."
