"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $80, which would be $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
