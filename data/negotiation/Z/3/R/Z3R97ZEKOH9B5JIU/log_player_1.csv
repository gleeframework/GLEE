{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to someone like you.  I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return while still giving you a significant advantage. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Appealing to Bob's Needs:** I'm highlighting the product's value to him specifically, suggesting it's a good investment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to negotiation, creating a sense of collaboration.
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer and can always walk away, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
