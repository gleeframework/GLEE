"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $10500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a bit more for the product.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's try $10750 as a compromise. It's closer to my offer, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
