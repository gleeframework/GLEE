"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a high starting price to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $950,000 is still below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **Avoiding the John safety net:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob. I'm not using the John option as a backup just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This strengthens my position for future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Meeting halfway:**  $900,000 is halfway between $850,000 and $950,000, making it a logical compromise point.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I've demonstrated my resolve to achieve a more favorable price. This counteroffer maintains that pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeatedly offered $850,000, and I'm unlikely to get a significantly higher price from him. 
* **Time pressure:** We're already four rounds in, and the negotiation window is shrinking.
* **Guaranteed profit:** While I'd prefer more, $850,000 is still a decent profit and better than John's offer. Accepting ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of further rejection."
