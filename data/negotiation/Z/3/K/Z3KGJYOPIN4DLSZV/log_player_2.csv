"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $11,000.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's value of $10,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further. Bob is not in a rush and has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to negotiate but still wants a good deal.  This counteroffer is still below Alice's latest offer, and it is closer to the middle ground between their desired prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. It's still worth trying to negotiate further, as Bob has a good chance of getting a better deal with more rounds of negotiation.  There is a significant difference between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price, and with a few more rounds, they might be able to find a price that works for both of them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time it's only a small increase. This shows Alice that he's serious about making a deal but is not willing to pay more than $11,000. It's also close to the middle ground between Bob's ideal price and Alice's latest offer, making it more likely that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still not a great deal. With only three rounds remaining, the chances of Alice accepting a lower offer are slim.  It's better for Bob to secure the product from John at $12,000, which is still within his budget and ensures he gets the product without further negotiation."
