"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $750,000. This price reflects the significant value the product holds for you and allows us to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $725,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $725,000.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  Let's settle on $737,500. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product to you and allows us to finalize the deal. ",737500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm afraid $737,500 is still too high for me. I'm going to have to stand firm at $725,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",725000.0,Bob,6,
