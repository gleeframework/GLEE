Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so anything less is unacceptable.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategic Offering**

You need to strike a balance:

* **Too High:**  Demanding close to $1,200,000 risks offending Bob and leading to rejection.
* **Too Low:** Offering a price closer to $1,000,000 leaves potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have a committed buyer at a lower price."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message clearly states your offer and implies the product's high value.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,100,000 gives Bob a $100,000 gain while securing you a significant $100,000 profit over your fallback option.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning the other buyer creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style (e.g., if he's known to be a hard bargainer), you might adjust your offer slightly. However, the core principle remains: aim for a price that is beneficial to both parties."
