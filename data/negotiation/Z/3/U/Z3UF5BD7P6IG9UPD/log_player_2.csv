"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have a committed buyer at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You can get the product for $1,100,000 from Alice, which is $100,000 cheaper than John's price.
* **Your goal is to save money.**  Even though Alice's offer is slightly higher than the product's worth to her, it's still the best option for you."
