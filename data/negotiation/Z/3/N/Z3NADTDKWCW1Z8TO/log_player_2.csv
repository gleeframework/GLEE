"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is less than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** While Bob could buy the product from John for $10,000, Alice's offer saves him $500. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
