"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. Our initial offer is $1200000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $1,200,000 since Bob's limit is $800,000.  It's also not worth buying from John yet as Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your proposal, we're willing to make a counteroffer. We're willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from our initial offer, and we believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,100,000 is a better offer than the previous one, it's still above Bob's limit of $800,000.  Bob has more rounds to negotiate and can hopefully get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above what I can reasonably afford. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're willing to consider your proposal, but we're still not willing to go as low as $900000. We're willing to make another counteroffer. We're willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise between our initial offer and your latest proposal. We believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it is still above Bob's budget. Bob can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice, and he has more rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle. However, we're still not willing to go as low as $950000. We're willing to make another counteroffer. We're willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is a compromise between our previous offers and your latest proposal. We believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has rejected Alice's offer several times and made counteroffers. However, Alice is not willing to come down below $1,025,000.  While there are more rounds remaining, it is unlikely Alice will lower the price further, especially since she is still significantly above Bob's preferred price.  It's now in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $800,000, as it is a more financially viable option and he is not likely to get a better deal from Alice."
