"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100. It's the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
