"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $12,000. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this high-quality item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept $12,000 when you can get the same product for $8,000 from John."
