Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price closer to the value Bob places on the product. This will give us room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, we can then consider lowering our price, but still aiming for a significant profit. Remember, we have John as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable middle ground, allowing us to close the deal without having to go through further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,500. While this is still lower than my initial target, it's a significant profit over selling to John. There's a chance I could get a higher price with further negotiation, but the risk of Bob walking away and leaving me with only John's offer is too high. This offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk."
