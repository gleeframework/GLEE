Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net at $1,200,000, Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Aiming closer to Bob's valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" to make the offer more appealing."
