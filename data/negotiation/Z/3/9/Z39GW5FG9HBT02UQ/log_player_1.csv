I'm going to try and get a bit closer to my desired price.  While $75 is a good offer, I can likely get a bit more."

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, we only have 4 rounds left.  If I keep going back and forth, I risk running out of time. I'm going to go ahead and sell the product to John for $80 to ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
