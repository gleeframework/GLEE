"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $750000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it now.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
