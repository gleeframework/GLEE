Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $750000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
