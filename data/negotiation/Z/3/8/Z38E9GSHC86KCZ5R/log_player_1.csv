Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Find a Balance:**  Offering it at $1,500,000 or more is likely to deter Bob. Aiming slightly below John's offer creates a win-win scenario where Bob gets a good deal and you maximize your profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The  $1,350,000 price provides some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle."
