Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between her offer and John's price is getting smaller.  It's better to secure a good deal at $110 than risk it for a potentially insignificant saving."
