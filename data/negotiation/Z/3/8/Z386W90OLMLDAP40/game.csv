"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, and I think this is a fair price. Can you consider it?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $11,500. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $11,000, but I'm willing to add a small concession of $50, making it $10,950. Can you consider this offer?",10950.0,Bob,6,
