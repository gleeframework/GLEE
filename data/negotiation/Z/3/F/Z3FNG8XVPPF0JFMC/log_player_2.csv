**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price from Alice. It's possible to get the product for less than $1,400,000."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,380,000 is a good deal. It saves you $120,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and potentially increasing the price is not worth it."
