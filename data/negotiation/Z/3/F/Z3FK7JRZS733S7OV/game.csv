"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still allow me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the adjusted price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That would work well for me.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,250 still isn't quite high enough for me.  Let's split the difference again - I'll come down to $11,875. This is a fair compromise, and it'll allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",11875.0,Alice,5,
