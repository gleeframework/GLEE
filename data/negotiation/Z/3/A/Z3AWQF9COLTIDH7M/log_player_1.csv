"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102?  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. I propose $98 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  There's also a good chance that if I reject his offer and counter, we might not reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up."
