Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than what Bob values the product at, but it's also significantly lower than what it's worth to you. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to earn a substantial profit.  

Remember, I'm a language model and can't actually negotiate, but this is how a smart seller would approach this situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent sum, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will make us both happy. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While $1,000,000 is a fair price for Bob, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  Since John is willing to pay $1,500,000, I will sell the product to John."
