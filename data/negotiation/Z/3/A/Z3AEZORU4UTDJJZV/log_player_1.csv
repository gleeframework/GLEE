Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get the highest price possible. Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a safety net with John, who will pay $15,000. This allows me to be more assertive in my initial offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies high demand and value to justify the price, even though Bob values it lower. 
 
This strategy aims for a price closer to my ideal while acknowledging Bob might try to negotiate down."
