"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while staying within the realm of potential deals."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming higher. I need to see if I can push for more before considering selling to John.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price, but still above his initial value of $800,000."

Round 3

This is my final push for a higher price.  I'm only $50,000 away from Bob's last offer, and I think this is a good compromise.  If he doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's not enough.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk him dropping out altogether.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a good profit."
