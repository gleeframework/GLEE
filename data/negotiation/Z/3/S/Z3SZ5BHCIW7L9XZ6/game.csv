"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $90. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $90. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",95.0,Alice,3,
