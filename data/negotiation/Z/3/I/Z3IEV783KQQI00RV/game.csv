"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
