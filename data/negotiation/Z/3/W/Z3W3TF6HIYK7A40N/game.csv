"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for what this product can do for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced. I'd be willing to pay $15,000, which is the midpoint between your original offer and my initial counteroffer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",15000.0,Bob,4,
