Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 110}

While $108 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a little more. I still think I can get closer to my desired price of $115."
