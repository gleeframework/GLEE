"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only do it for $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, but $15,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $12,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm open to a final offer of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be very valuable. Let's make a deal!",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I can go up to $13,000. It's a fair price considering your initial asking price and the value I see in the product. Let me know if this works for you, as I'm ready to close the deal today.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $13,000 is a respectable offer. However, I'm still holding out for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product and the time we've spent negotiating. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
