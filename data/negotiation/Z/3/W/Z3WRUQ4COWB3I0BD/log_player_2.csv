Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only do it for $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, but $15,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $12,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm open to a final offer of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be very valuable. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I can go up to $13,000. It's a fair price considering your initial asking price and the value I see in the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $13,000 is a respectable offer. However, I'm still holding out for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product and the time we've spent negotiating. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very attached to getting at least $13,500.  While she might come down slightly, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's $10,000 offer.  At this point, cutting your losses and going with the guaranteed lower price from John makes the most sense."
