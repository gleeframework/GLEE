Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for some wiggle room.
* **Room for compromise:**  While the price is higher than Bob's value, it's not exorbitantly so, making it plausible for him to consider.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I'll get at least my minimum price if Bob rejects.

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Even though Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it still falls below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Keeping John in the mix:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep John as a viable alternative if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:** I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I've lowered my price from the initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Staying above my minimum:** My counteroffer remains above my minimum price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't compromise my own value.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer aims to see how far Bob is willing to go. If he rejects, I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is unlikely to reach my desired price:**  Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum, and further negotiations are unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **John provides a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price and avoid further negotiations with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, as it guarantees a satisfactory outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
