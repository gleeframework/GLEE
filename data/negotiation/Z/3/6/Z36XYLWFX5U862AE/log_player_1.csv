**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price significantly lower than your $150 backup. At this point, the negotiation is dragging on and it's unlikely Bob will meet your minimum price. Selling to John guarantees you get your minimum acceptable price without further haggling."
