"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $115? Let's see if we can work something out.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $115 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $120? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase it from you.",120.0,Bob,4,
