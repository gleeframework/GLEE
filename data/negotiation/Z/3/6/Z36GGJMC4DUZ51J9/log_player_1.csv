Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for negotiation if needed. It aims to secure a deal that significantly exceeds your minimum while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value."
