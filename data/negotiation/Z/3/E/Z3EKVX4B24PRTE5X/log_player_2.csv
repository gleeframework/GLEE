"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000.  I think it would be a valuable asset for you, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  By stating a maximum price, we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to lower her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I could consider coming down to $10,500. This is a very reasonable offer considering its benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $10,500 is still beyond my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  **Direct and Firm:** This counteroffer is direct and clearly states your maximum budget.  
* **Fairness:**  By stating it's your maximum and suggesting a ""halfway"" point, it frames the offer as fair, even though it favors you.
* **Alternative:**  Alice knows you have the option to go with John at $8,000, so this offer puts some pressure on her without being confrontational."
