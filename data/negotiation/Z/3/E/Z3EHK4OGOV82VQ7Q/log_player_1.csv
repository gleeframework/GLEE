Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being competitive enough to entice Bob to buy. 

Here's why:

* **Profit:** This price offers a $40 profit for me, significantly higher than the $0 profit I'd get by selling to John.
* **Attractiveness to Bob:**  The price is still lower than the value Bob places on the product ($150), making it a good deal for him. 
* **Risk mitigation:**  While I could offer a higher price, there's a chance Bob would reject it and I'd be stuck selling to John at a lower price. 

This offer maximizes my potential profit while managing the risk of losing a sale entirely."
