{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is close enough to my target that I'm willing to accept it. It's better than my current offer of $1,300,000, and it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. I've saved $150,000 by negotiating with Alice, and the risk of further negotiation might result in Alice becoming less flexible."
