"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This gives us room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm not going to risk it by starting too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too low for me, considering my minimum value is $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell at a significant loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price higher than John's offer. Bob knows I'm willing to sell, but he also knows my minimum value. I hope this counteroffer will make him realize he needs to compromise if he wants to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with that price. There's a good chance we can reach a more agreeable price within the remaining rounds. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum value.  It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still more than Bob's last offer. This is my final offer before I seriously consider selling to John. I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid missing out on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'm still a bit disappointed it's not my full minimum, it's a reasonable price, and I'm worried about running out of time. If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing both Bob and the time to sell to John. It's time to close the deal."
