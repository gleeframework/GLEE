Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find a mutually agreeable solution.  My final offer is $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and is unlikely to go much lower than $1,400,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  At this point, it's safer to take the sure deal and save $400,000, even though there might have been a tiny chance to get a slightly better deal with Alice."
