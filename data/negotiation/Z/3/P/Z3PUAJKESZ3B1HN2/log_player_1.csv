"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$725,000 is too low. I need to get closer to my target of $800,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a price that's more favorable to me.  $850,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up too much. I'll counter again, and if he's not willing to get closer to my price, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to try a lower counteroffer to see if we can come to an agreement. If Bob still rejects, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $705,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $705,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  His offers are just too low, and it's not worth continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John guarantees me the $800,000 I need, so it's the best option at this point."
