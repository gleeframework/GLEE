{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but am also willing to negotiate. I'll adjust my offers based on Alice's responses."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on her price, which is a good sign. However, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject her offer and try to push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $850,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where Alice will accept, allowing me to save a significant amount compared to John's offer."
