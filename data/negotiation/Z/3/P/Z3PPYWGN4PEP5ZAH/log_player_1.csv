"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll gauge Bob's interest with this initial offer. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  There are still 9 rounds, and I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly to $900,000, still a significant profit for me. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good price. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and a decent profit. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
