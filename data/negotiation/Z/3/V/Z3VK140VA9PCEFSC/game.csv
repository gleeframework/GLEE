"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a tempting offer, the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
