"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, though. Would you be willing to come down to $13000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $13000. How about we meet in the middle at $17000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can close this deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,
