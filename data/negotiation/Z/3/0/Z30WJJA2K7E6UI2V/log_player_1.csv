Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but I think $950,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than I'm comfortable with. John offers a guaranteed sale at $800,000, which meets my minimum requirement. I'll sell to John."
