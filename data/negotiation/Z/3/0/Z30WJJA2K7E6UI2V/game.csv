"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but I think $950,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is significantly below the value I'm seeking.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the value this product brings.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000?  I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This reflects the value of the product while also showing my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $780,000? It's a fair offer that acknowledges the product's value while working within my budget.",780000.0,Bob,6,
