Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product. This approach aims to start the negotiation on a positive note. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential earnings.  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also be willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low.  This creates a sense of urgency for Bob and incentivizes him to make a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's not in my best interest. 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I've already established that I won't sell below $150.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or I can always sell to John for $150.
* **Negotiation Power:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and maintain my negotiation power.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $135? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the ""fair price"" and ""great deal"" aspects, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and value.
* **Building Trust:** The message reaffirms my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $125. This price allows me to stay within my budget while still getting a good value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my threshold. I've already made a concession to meet him halfway, and further negotiation might result in a protracted process with no guarantee of a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:**  My bottom line is $150.  Even though $125 is a better offer than before, it's still not worth the potential risk of continued negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and energy, potentially preventing me from securing a better deal elsewhere.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a quick transaction.

**Conclusion:**

Considering my minimum price, the potential for further negotiation, and the opportunity cost, selling to John at $150 is the most advantageous option at this point."
