Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:** This price shows you're confident in your product's value and are not willing to give it away cheaply. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's worth trying to push for a higher price. You can likely secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about $1,125,000? This is still a fair price, and it would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:**  It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer, which shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate upwards if Bob is willing to budge.
* **Maintains a good price:** You're still selling the product for more than your minimum, so it's a win for you!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a slightly higher price.  You have a good chance of getting closer to your target by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm close to my limit here. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. How about $1,100,000?  This is a great price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference again:**  It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing continued willingness to compromise.
* **Focuses on a win-win:** It emphasizes that this price is beneficial for both parties.
* **Increases urgency:** The ""close to my limit"" phrasing suggests you might not be willing to negotiate further."

Bob's offer:

It's time to cut your losses. You've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and it seems he's not willing to budge much further.  You've already gotten close to your minimum price with Bob, and John is offering you your absolute minimum.  It's time to sell to John and move on!"
