"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects a significant saving for you compared to your own valuation of $800,000 and leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

This is a compromise that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $900,000.  This would give you a good profit, and I'd still be getting a significant discount from my own valuation.",900000.0,Bob,4,
