{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to buying from John, there's still room for negotiation to save even more money.  Bob wants to get the product for as low a price as possible, so he should try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 9
Alice's offer:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left, the time for negotiation is running out. Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and her current offer of $990,000 is still too high for Bob.  While Bob could make another counteroffer, there's a strong chance Alice will reject it, leaving him with no deal.

Given this scenario, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This guarantees him the product, even if it's at a higher price.  The risk of not closing a deal with Alice outweighs the potential savings of a few more thousand dollars."
