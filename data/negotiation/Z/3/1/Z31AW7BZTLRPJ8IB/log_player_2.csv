"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be very beneficial for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. How does $115 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's best to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first.  You've stated your maximum budget is $120, so you have room to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $105 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still try to negotiate a lower price, since you are willing to pay up to $120."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. I'm still interested but $110 is a little too high for me.  How about $108? That would be a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 108}
