Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your $10,000 minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows that you're serious about selling to Bob, but not desperate.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can lower your price slightly, but never below your $10,000 minimum. Always be prepared to walk away and sell to John if you feel you're not getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,800 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that brings the price closer to your desired value.  You have room to maneuver before you need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,150? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's a midpoint between your previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,800.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $9,150 is still higher than your $10,000 minimum, so you're not losing money.
* **Shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate, but not desperate to sell. 

This is a good position to be in. If Bob accepts, you'll make a decent profit. If he rejects, you can make another counteroffer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,900 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below your minimum desired price of $10,000.  While you could continue to negotiate with Bob, you've already made two counteroffers and it seems he's not willing to budge significantly.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the sale to John for $10,000, ensuring you meet your minimum profit goal."
