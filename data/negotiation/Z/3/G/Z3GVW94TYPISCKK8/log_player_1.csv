Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential value to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of selling to John for $10,000 if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong negotiating position."
