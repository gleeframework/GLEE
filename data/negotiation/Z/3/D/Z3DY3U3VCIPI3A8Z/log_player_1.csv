Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have to consider adjusting my price or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for him, but I'm also not willing to drop too low at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Even though Bob is willing to pay $85, it's not worth it for me to continue negotiating with him.  I'm able to get my minimum asking price by selling to John, and I don't want to risk lowering my price further and potentially ending up with less money."
