Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is more than your minimum price of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's space for him to counteroffer and for you to compromise.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By starting with a higher price, you increase the chance of getting a better price in the end.  You can always lower the price later if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than your initial offer, but it's still above your minimum acceptable price. However, you want to try to get closer to your ideal price. Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate, but not too much.
* **Is still profitable:** $130 is still above your minimum of $100.
* **Leaves room for agreement:** You're offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives you a decent profit margin. 

You're aiming for a price that's both fair to you and appealing to Bob, increasing the chance of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still a decent profit for you, as it's above your minimum of $100.  You've already lowered your price twice, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profitable outcome."
