"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's more beneficial for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum, but still a good deal for you. How about $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target.  Bob has several options:

* **Reject and Counter Offer:** Bob could counter with $10,000, hoping to find a middle ground.
* **Buy from John:** Since John is offering the product for $10,000, this is a safe option, and Bob is not losing money. 

Given that Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again seems like the best strategy for this round. This gives Bob more room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm committed to purchasing this product, but $10,000 is my absolute limit.  Let's close the deal at this price, as it's a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $10500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, but it's still higher than what John is offering. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. 

Here's why:

* **Guaranteed Deal:** Buying from John guarantees a deal at the desired price. There's no risk of further negotiation or rejection.
* **Potential Savings:**  Even though Alice might be willing to go down further, there's no guarantee. Bob could end up spending more time negotiating and potentially ending up with a higher price than John's offer.

Given Bob's goal to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the most logical and safe decision in this round."
