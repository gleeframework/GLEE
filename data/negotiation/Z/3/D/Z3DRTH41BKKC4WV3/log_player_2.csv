"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for less than $14,000, and there's a chance he can get it even lower."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to get a better deal. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,800. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for less than $13,800. It's worth continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I'm offering the product to you for $14,100. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not the absolute lowest price he could possibly get, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John.  He's getting the product for $900 less than John's price, and further negotiation might not get him a significantly better price, especially since Alice has stated it's her final offer."
