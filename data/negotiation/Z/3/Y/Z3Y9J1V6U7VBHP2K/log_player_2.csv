You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's no reason to buy from John at this point, as Alice's offer is already lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down further.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice's offer is now the same as John's. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as it's unlikely she'll go lower. I'll take the product from John to avoid any further delays."
