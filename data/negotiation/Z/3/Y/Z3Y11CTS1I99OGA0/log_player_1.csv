"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate and also shows Bob that I am serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price. I believe $11,000 is a good compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, considering I have several rounds left and the alternative of selling to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a small concession by decreasing the price to $10,500. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I still maintain a reasonable price considering my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While it's tempting to keep negotiating with Bob, we've reached a point where his offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  The time constraint and the opportunity to sell to John for a significantly higher price make it strategically better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 sale with John.  Further negotiation with Bob risks ending up with a lower price, leaving me worse off than selling to John."
