"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
