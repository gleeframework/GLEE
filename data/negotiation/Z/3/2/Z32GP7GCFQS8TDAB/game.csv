"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is closer, I'm still aiming to keep it at $80. It's my budget limit, and I'd really like to make this work. Let's try to find common ground, maybe something in the middle?",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $80 is your budget limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $80, which would be $90. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,5,
