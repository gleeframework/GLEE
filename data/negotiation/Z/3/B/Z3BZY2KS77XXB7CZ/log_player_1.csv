Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount:** The price is well below my minimum acceptable price, which shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space for Bob to counteroffer without me having to accept a price too low.
* **It's a high enough price:**  It's still significantly more than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to potentially earn a good profit. 

Remember, my goal is to maximize my earnings. I will carefully consider Bob's counteroffers and my options (including selling to John) to make the best decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $850,000 is the lowest I can go.  This price still leaves you with a great deal considering the value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, it's still well above his offer and gives me a better profit than selling to John.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $820,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $820,000 is still below my desired price, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  

I'm willing to accept this offer because:

* It's a good profit for me, considering the potential risk of continuing negotiations.
* There's a chance that Bob might not budge further, and I might end up losing more by continuing negotiations. 
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be ideal, but there's no guarantee that he'll still be available or willing to buy if I continue negotiating with Bob. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
