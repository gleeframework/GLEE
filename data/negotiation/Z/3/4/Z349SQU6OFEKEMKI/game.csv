"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $11,000. Considering its value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $12,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12250.0,Alice,5,
