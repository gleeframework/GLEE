{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This allows for some negotiation space and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell for my minimum price of $120, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $120. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that this will be a long and drawn-out process.  John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, and I can guarantee a sale with him.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120."
