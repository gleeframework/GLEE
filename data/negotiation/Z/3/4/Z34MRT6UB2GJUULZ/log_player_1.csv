Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counter offer.  While I could sell to John for $800,000, I'm hoping I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and counter offer again. While I'm getting closer to John's offer, I'm hoping I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not sure we'll reach a deal.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This guarantees me a sale and a profit.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting nothing is too high."
