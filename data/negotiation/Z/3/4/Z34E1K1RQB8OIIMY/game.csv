"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $8,000. This aligns more closely with my assessment of the product's worth. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $8,500. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  This price allows us both to come to a compromise and finalize this transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground on this price.",8750.0,Alice,5,
