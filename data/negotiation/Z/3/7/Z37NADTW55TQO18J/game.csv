"Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a substantial amount.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm confident that this product holds immense value. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This still offers you a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both.",800000.0,Bob,4,
