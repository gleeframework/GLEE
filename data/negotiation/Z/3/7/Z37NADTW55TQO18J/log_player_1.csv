{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,800,000. I believe its value to you will be substantial, and this price reflects its high quality and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a substantial amount.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm confident that this product holds immense value. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is a substantial amount, it is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as I believe there's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still offers you a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm on his offer of $800,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it appears we're at an impasse.  To avoid further rounds of negotiation that may not lead to a satisfactory outcome, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me a price above my minimum threshold and avoids the risk of a lower offer or further negotiation with Bob."
