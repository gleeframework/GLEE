"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said,  $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the value I know this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,750,000 is close, but I need a price that truly reflects the value of what you're getting. How about we land at $1,900,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
