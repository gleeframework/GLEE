Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (e.g., $200) could scare Bob away instantly.  A price of $135 leaves a reasonable chance he'll accept while still giving us a good profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of just stating the price, the message emphasizes the ""value"" the product provides, subtly justifying the cost. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $135. This strategy balances the risk of losing him with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
