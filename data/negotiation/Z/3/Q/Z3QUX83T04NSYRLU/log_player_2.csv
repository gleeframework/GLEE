"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above your limit of $10,000. There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice before considering buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's close to my maximum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to lower my price to $11,500. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still have room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get the price down to $10,500. I'll counter with a price closer to my limit and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous counteroffer and Alice's offer.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about closing the deal while still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $11,250 is still above my limit. I'm determined to stay under $10,500 and believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push to get a price I'm comfortable with.  $10,750 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's only slightly below her previous offer.  This should be a reasonable compromise that allows us to close the deal without me needing to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $10,900. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is close to my limit, I'm not comfortable going above my target of $10,500. It's better to accept John's offer and get the product for $10,000.  This ensures I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiation."
