"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below my initial price, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  To make this deal work, I'd need to receive at least $1200000. This is a significant reduction from my original asking price, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let me know if you're able to bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm confident this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to come down to $1000000 as a final offer. It's a significant compromise for me, but it shows my desire to make this work. Let me know if you're able to accept.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
