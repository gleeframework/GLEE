"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $95. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $110. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $100. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $115. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,7,
