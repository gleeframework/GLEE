"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is quite high, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair, and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $750,000?  That seems like a reasonable compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you consider $775,000? That seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,6,
