Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $100 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This price still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
