"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know if it's something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. It's worth exploring if Bob can get a better price from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, my budget for this type of item is a bit lower.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,175,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate and should continue to try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not quite there with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll propose a price of $1,225,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is going back up, and we are already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  There's a good chance that Alice won't budge much further, and Bob is unlikely to get the price down to his target range. Buying from John at $1,000,000 ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price within his budget."
