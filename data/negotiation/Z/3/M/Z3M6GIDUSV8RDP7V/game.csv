"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,175,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly.  Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not quite there with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll propose a price of $1,225,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
