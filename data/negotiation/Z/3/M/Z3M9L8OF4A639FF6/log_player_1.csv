"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I want to try to get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000.  I'm hoping Bob will come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still allows me to make a good return on my investment, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll be more flexible if Bob continues to decline."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, it's still not quite where I need to be.  To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to drop to $1,275,000. This compromise allows us both to come closer to our desired price points.  I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I really need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,400,000. While the offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not within my desired range. I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,225,000 simply isn't a sustainable price for me. I'm willing to make one final concession,  dropping to $1,250,000.  This offer is a good compromise, and it reflects the true value of this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I really need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000 which is still a significant amount.  The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob in the next two rounds and getting nothing is too high for me."
