"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still allows me to make a good return on my investment, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, it's still not quite where I need to be.  To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to drop to $1,275,000. This compromise allows us both to come closer to our desired price points.  I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful you'll consider it.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I really need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,225,000 simply isn't a sustainable price for me. I'm willing to make one final concession,  dropping to $1,250,000.  This offer is a good compromise, and it reflects the true value of this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I really need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
