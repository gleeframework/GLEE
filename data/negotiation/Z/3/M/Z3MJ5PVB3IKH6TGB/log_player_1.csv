Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to me creates a sense of urgency and potentially influences Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** Starting at $12,000 allows for a few counteroffers before I have to consider selling to John at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it's not drastically unreasonable. There's still potential for negotiation.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $9,000 but lower than my initial offer of $12,000. This will give Bob some room to negotiate while still keeping my price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to work with you, though.  How about $10,500?  That's a good compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a product you value at $8,000."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:**  $10,500 is a midpoint between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob receives by mentioning his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is only $500 lower than my counteroffer of $10,500. This signifies that we are very close to a deal.
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further, there's a chance that he will walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Meeting My Minimum:**  While $10,000 is lower than my ideal selling price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.

**Conclusion:**

It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale for $10,000. It's a good compromise that allows me to avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely."
