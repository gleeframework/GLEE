"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to work with you, though.  How about $10,500?  That's a good compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a product you value at $8,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
