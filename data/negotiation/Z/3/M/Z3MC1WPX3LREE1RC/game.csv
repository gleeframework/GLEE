"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  To be candid, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I've tried to be flexible, but  $950,000 is simply too far below what I can accept.  My final offer is $980,000.  This is a firm price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value this product offers.",980000.0,Alice,5,
