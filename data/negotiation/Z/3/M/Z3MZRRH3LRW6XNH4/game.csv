"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we try $10,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I can't go lower than $10,900.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on! ",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close, but I think we can do even better. How about $10,750 is still a bit too high, but I'm willing to go to $10,800? That's the lowest I can go and still make this deal work for me.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,850?  That way we can both be happy and move on with this deal.  What do you think?",10850.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,850, so how about $10,425? That's the lowest I can go and still make this deal work for me.",10425.0,Bob,8,
