Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We start by aiming high, closer to Bob's perceived value of $150. This maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer doesn't start at $150, leaving space for Bob to potentially counter-offer and feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Considering the Alternative:** We know we have a guaranteed $80 from John. Offering the product for anything less than $80 to Bob would be a loss."
