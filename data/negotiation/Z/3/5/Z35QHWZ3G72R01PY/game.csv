"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above that.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $925,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still think $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $862,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price for both of us.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $890,000?  That's a significant concession on my end and a fair price for this quality.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $845,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.",845000.0,Bob,6,
