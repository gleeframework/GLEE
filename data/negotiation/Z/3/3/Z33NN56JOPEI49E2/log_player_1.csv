Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Given its market value and my own budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below its value to him. While accepting would close the deal, it's worth negotiating further to try and secure a higher price.  We're still early in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, I'm still committed to finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This compromise demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but Bob is still valuing the product significantly below his actual valuation. It's worth another counteroffer to try and bridge this gap."

Round 5
