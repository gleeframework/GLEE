"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Given its market value and my own budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
