"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm prepared to sell it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a significant discount for you, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a significant discount from her initial offer and within my budget. This is a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept.  Buying from John would be more expensive, so this is the best option."
