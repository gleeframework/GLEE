"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm asking $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $11,000 right now.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  That way we're both a little closer to where we want to be.",12250.0,Bob,4,
