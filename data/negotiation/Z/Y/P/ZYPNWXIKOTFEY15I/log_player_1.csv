Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product at a price that reflects its value and potential. I believe $1,300,000 is a fair starting point. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:** This is a starting point that is closer to my value of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** The offer is closer to my desired price, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can counter or move on to John without losing too much.
* **Build a positive relationship:** A friendly tone sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share the value of this product. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired price of $1,500,000.  While it is tempting to accept, it's crucial to consider the following:

* **Negotiation power:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation open. I can potentially counter with a higher price or move on to John if needed.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance Bob might raise his offer after a counteroffer or further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to find a middle ground. If we can't reach a mutually acceptable price, I'll proceed with selling the product to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your proposal.  Let's meet halfway at $1,250,000.  I believe this offers a good balance for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial price. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget while emphasizing the value of the product.  I'm positioning this as a fair solution for both parties.

**Rationale:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** This counteroffer signals flexibility without compromising my core goal of earning as much as possible. 
* **Test the Waters:** It allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and whether he's ready to meet me halfway. 
* **Set the Stage for a Deal:**  If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I can secure a sale closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I can choose to either counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I really appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $1225000. This allows us to come closer together while still staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, it's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations. 

**Why Sell to John?**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, wasting valuable time.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of losing out on the guaranteed profit from selling to John.

While I'd prefer to sell the product at a higher price, my goal is to secure the best possible deal within a reasonable timeframe. Selling to John allows me to achieve this."
