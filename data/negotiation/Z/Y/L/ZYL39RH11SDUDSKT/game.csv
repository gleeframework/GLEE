"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential returns you'll gain.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see value in the product, but $800,000 significantly undervalues its true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,625,000?",1625000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price. However, $1,625,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000. If you'd be willing to come down to $1,100,000, I think we could close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I value the time we've invested in this negotiation. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be realistic. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement while acknowledging the product's significant worth.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but $1,200,000 is the absolute highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
