"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential returns you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This establishes a negotiation stance and leaves room for me to increase my offer gradually.
* **Below My Maximum:** I'm aiming to pay significantly less than my $1,000,000 maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility and how serious she is about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see value in the product, but $800,000 significantly undervalues its true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,625,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved considerably from her initial offer, $1,625,000 is still significantly above both my target price and John's guaranteed price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's room for further negotiation.  I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price. However, $1,625,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000. If you'd be willing to come down to $1,100,000, I think we could close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm acknowledging Alice's movement but standing firm that her price is too high. 
* **Introducing Alternatives:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Targeted Increase:** My counteroffer is a significant jump from my previous one, signaling a willingness to make a deal if Alice is reasonable.
* **Still Below Maximum:** This offer keeps me below my maximum price while leaving some room for minor adjustments if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I value the time we've invested in this negotiation. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be realistic. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement while acknowledging the product's significant worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable price, but $1,350,000 is still a significant amount over my fallback option with John.
* **Time Remaining:** We still have five rounds left, so there's room to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to my target.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Accepting now might signal that I'm willing to go higher, which could work against me in the long run. I want to maintain pressure and see how low Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but $1,200,000 is the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** By explicitly stating a lower alternative offer, I'm trying to anchor Alice's perception of my price ceiling. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by implying that the alternative product might not be available for long.
* **Final Offer:** While I haven't explicitly said it's my ""final offer,"" I'm strongly suggesting that $1,200,000 is my limit to encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **Still Room for Alice:** This offer still gives Alice a substantial profit margin, hopefully enticing her to accept."
