"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'm confident in the product's value to Bob and believe he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a profitable price for me. I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low.  Although I'm running out of time, I believe we can reach a better price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to persuade Bob to accept.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller profit to secure the deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Although I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm running out of time and his offers are still too low for me.  Selling to John guarantees me a good profit and avoids further delays."
