"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $22,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This product really does offer exceptional value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be willing to go. To be frank, I have another potential buyer lined up. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. Would you consider $16,000? This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $16,000 is still pushing it for my budget.  I can go up to $13,000, but that's really the absolute highest I can go.",13000.0,Bob,6,
