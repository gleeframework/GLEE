Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This product really does offer exceptional value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be willing to go.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John.  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him not budging significantly, and I'd lose the opportunity to sell to John."
