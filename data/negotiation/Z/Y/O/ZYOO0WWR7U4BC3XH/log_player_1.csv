Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also looking to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
