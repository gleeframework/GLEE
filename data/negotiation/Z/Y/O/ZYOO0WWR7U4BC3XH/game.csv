"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also looking to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product and my original asking price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute limit. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe we can find common ground here. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer $1,225,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
