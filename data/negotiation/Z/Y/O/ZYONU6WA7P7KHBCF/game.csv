"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for it. Would it be possible for us to reach an agreement within this price range?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is your budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept that low of a price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $180. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I'm still unable to meet at $180 due to my budget constraints. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to my maximum limit of $80? I'm hoping for a compromise that would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $80. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $160. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to adjust, I'm still unable to meet at $160. I believe we might be able to find a middle ground. Could we possibly aim for a price closer to my maximum limit of $80? I'm hopeful for a solution that respects both our positions.",80.0,Bob,6,
