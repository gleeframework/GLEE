# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation. This is a great deal for Bob, as it's well below his maximum budget and saves him a significant amount of money. There's no need to negotiate further."
