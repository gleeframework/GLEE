Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. My asking price is $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John immediately for $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob counters) while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to justify your price and potentially negotiate if Bob counters."
