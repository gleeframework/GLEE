"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing  $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $975,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both are trying to find a reasonable point here.  To close this out today, how about $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
