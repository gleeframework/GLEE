{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and persuasive message encourages Bob to consider the offer without sounding overly aggressive.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming to maximize my profit while acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay my full valuation.
* This offer allows for potential negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away.
* It leaves me the option to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also below his own perceived value of $12,000, which suggests he's trying to get a very good deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price, as I can get that from John.
* Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* By rejecting, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, but also my firm stance on value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $13,000? That's a good price for you and still fair for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that's closer to Bob's initial offer but still significantly higher than his first counteroffer.
* **Message:**  A friendly but firm message acknowledges Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value of the product. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both agree on a price. 
* By not going too low, I show that I still value the product, but I'm willing to negotiate.
* This approach keeps the negotiation open and increases the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also above his own perceived value of $12,000, indicating a willingness to compromise. 

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price.
* While $12,500 is less than my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a sale quickly.
* Given that I can sell to John for $15,000, I am confident that I can find another buyer if I need to in the future."
