Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice has come down to $8,500, which is a good price. You're saving $3,500 from John's price, and it's likely you won't get a much better deal from Alice."
