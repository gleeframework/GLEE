"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm for this product, but $9000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $7500 at this time. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.
