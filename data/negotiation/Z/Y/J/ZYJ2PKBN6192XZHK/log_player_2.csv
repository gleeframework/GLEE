"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are more rounds available, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value and well below my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible, so he's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum value. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While Alice's offer is closer to his ideal price, he can likely get it down even further.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise.  He's met Alice halfway between her last offer and his previous offer.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to close the deal, but he's still trying to get a price he's comfortable with."
