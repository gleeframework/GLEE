"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value and well below my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's find a compromise here.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
