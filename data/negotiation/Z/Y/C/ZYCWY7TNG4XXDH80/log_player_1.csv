{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $12,400 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,200? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can make a deal at this price.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I can always sell to John if necessary."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the price I was originally considering for buying from John. I'm really hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob is close to my minimum price, I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. John is a sure thing at a higher price, and with only two rounds left, it's not worth risking losing out on a better deal."
