"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $750,000?  It represents a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
