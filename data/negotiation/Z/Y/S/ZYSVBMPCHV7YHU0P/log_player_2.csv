Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.
