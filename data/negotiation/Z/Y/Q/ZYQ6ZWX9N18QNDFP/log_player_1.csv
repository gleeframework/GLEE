Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
