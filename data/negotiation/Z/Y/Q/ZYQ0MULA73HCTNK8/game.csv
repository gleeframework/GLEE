"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the product's value, $1,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 as a starting point, reflecting the maximum I can pay at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $775,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $860,000 for the product. This offer takes into account the points you've raised while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. Let's make a deal.",860000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  $860,000 is still just a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $825,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  I'm eager to finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,
