"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below my initial asking price.  This product offers immense value, and I believe a price of $1,400,000 is more reflective of its worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more substantial offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We're still early in the negotiation, and I believe I can get him closer to $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a slightly higher price.  Let's settle this right now: $1,350,000, and we have a deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to your target, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,350,000. I'll meet you at $1,320,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product and is incrementally increasing his offer. While I could push for a slightly higher price, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting $1,320,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
