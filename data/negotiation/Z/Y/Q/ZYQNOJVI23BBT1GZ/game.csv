"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below my initial asking price.  This product offers immense value, and I believe a price of $1,400,000 is more reflective of its worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more substantial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a slightly higher price.  Let's settle this right now: $1,350,000, and we have a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
