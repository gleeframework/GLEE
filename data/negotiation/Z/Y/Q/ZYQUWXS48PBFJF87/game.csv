"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, the price point is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a starting point for further discussion.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. However, your offer falls significantly short of reflecting the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see a more realistic counteroffer from your end to continue this negotiation.  How about we consider $1,900,000? This price represents a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, and I believe my offer is a fair starting point.  To show I'm serious, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving your offer upward. However, we're still quite a ways apart. To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to be viable for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value this product brings.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your transparency regarding your minimum price.  However, the gap between our positions is still considerable.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant move on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to securing this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, the gap is still there, but I appreciate you significantly increasing your offer. It demonstrates to me you're serious about this. To be completely open, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,500,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's a fantastic deal for the value you're getting.  What do you say, shall we close this deal?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
