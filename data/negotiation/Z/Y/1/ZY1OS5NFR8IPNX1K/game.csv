"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe this product will be a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $11,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  I'm very interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can do $11,250, which is still a good compromise, but also reflects the value I believe the product brings. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. I'm still very interested, but $11,250 is a bit too much for me.  Let's try to find common ground. How about $10,750? This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'd like to propose a small adjustment to make it more attractive for you. I can throw in some additional value, such as a warranty and support package, which would normally cost $250. If you're interested, I can include this as a sweetener, and we can finalize the deal at $10,750. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer of the warranty and support package. That's definitely a nice addition. However, I'm still trying to keep my budget under $10,500.  Would you be willing to drop the price to $10,500, and include the warranty and support package? That would make this a very attractive deal for me.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you like the idea of the warranty and support package. However, I'm not willing to go back to $10,500. I can meet you halfway between $10,750 and $10,500, which is $10,625. I'll include the warranty and support package, and we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",10625.0,Alice,9,
