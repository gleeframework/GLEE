"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for it.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $11500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500. This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $12250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
