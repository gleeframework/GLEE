"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the [Product Name], but I can only pay up to $8000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the [Product Name], but I am still unable to meet the price of $12000. I would like to propose a price of $10000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's settle on $11000.  This price reflects the value of the product and shows my willingness to reach a deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
