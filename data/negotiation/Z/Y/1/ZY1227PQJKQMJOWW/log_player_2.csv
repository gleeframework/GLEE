"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $17000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $17,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can get the product for $15,000 from John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
