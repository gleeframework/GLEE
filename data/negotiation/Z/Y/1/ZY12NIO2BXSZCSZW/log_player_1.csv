Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000."",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value will help you understand how interested he is. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can always come down to a price closer to his valuation.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
