Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying within a profitable range.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
