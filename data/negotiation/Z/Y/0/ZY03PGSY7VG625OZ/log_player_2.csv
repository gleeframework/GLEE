Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal, but I'm starting to wonder if we have different ideas of fair value. I've made significant concessions, and $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer who sees the value at my initial asking price. However, I believe in giving you every opportunity. My final offer is $1,200,000. This is my absolute bottom line.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, $1,200,000 is still too high. Her mention of another interested buyer might be a tactic to pressure me, but I'm not ready to give in yet.  I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially since she's called this her ""final offer"". I'll continue trying to secure a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
