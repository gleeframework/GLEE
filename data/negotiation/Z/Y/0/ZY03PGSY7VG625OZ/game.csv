"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,800,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for a product that is valuable to both of us. I'm hoping we can find a compromise to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to finding an agreement, and I want to assure you I'm committed as well.  Let's bridge this gap. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still recognizing the significant value this product holds.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement. While $1,350,000 is a significant step in the right direction, it's still above my budget.  I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both sides.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal, but I'm starting to wonder if we have different ideas of fair value. I've made significant concessions, and $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer who sees the value at my initial asking price. However, I believe in giving you every opportunity. My final offer is $1,200,000. This is my absolute bottom line.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping it's enough to reach an agreement. I'm ready to finalize the purchase immediately.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
