"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been developing for a while, and I think it perfectly aligns with your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss it further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
