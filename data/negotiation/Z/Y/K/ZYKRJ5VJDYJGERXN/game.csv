"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. This product is truly top-of-the-line and will bring you a lot of value. Could you do $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is high-quality, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
