}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer at $1,330,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still securing a profit of $330,000 above our minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations longer risks Bob losing interest or finding alternatives.
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee we can get a better offer from Bob, even with more rounds. 

Accepting now locks in a good deal and avoids potential downsides of continued negotiation."
