Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll recognize the immense potential this product holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Aiming for a price close to this maximizes potential profit while leaving Bob with a perceived gain.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The ""one-time offer"" creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This offer to Bob is significantly more profitable.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact valuation and that there's no opportunity for further negotiation."
