Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth without being too pushy. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  You don't want to scare Bob away with a take-it-or-leave-it approach. By signaling flexibility, you increase the chances of a successful negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
