"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given my research and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the true value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,100,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers both our positions.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant amount for me.  I believe this demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product, and I hope you'll consider it.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
