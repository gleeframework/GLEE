{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's a good margin to work with.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer at $80, so you're not desperate. 

By starting at $130, you give yourself the best chance of getting closer to Bob's maximum valuation while ensuring you significantly exceed your minimum price if he accepts."
