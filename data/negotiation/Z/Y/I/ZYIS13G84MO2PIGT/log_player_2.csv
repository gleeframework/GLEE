"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $150 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, there is no reason to negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product immediately from John at your maximum price."
