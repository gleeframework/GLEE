"Alice, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only offer $8000 right now.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and it's a price that I think is fair given the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
