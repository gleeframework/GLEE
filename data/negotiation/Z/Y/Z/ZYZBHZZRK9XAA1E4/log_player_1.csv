I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,750,000. This is a strong starting point, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also within a reasonable range for Bob, considering the product's value to him is $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,650,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,620,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $20,000 less than my initial counteroffer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,650,000, accepting this offer is the best choice.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better price in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $1,620,000 is still a good profit and a satisfactory outcome."
