The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is asking for $120. This is too much. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $80.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  What about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $105. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. I've already gone up to $95, and she's only willing to come down to $105. I'm better off buying the product from John for $80."
