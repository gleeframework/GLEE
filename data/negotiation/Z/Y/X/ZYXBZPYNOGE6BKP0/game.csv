"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $80.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  What about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $105. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",105.0,Alice,5,
