Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $115 is higher than Bob's $100 value, so he may be hesitant to accept.
* **It's below John's value:**  $115 is lower than John's $120 value, so if Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and make a profit.

This gives me the best chance of maximizing my earnings, as I either sell at a good price to Bob or I have a guaranteed sale to John."
