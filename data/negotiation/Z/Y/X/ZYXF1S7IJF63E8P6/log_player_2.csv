"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $8,000, and John is selling for $8,000. Alice's offer doesn't provide any savings. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John."
