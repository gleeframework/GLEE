"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a lower price, and I get a quick sale. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit while still offering you a good deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
