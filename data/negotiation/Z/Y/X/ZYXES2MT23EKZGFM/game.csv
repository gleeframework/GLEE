"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a significant investment. However, the value of this product is much higher than $60. Would you consider $160? I'm confident you'll be happy with this price.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $160 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $120?  That's a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to make this work for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
