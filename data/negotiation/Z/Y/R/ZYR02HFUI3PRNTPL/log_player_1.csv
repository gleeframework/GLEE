{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** A friendly message makes Bob feel more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Open Ended:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and opens the door for counteroffers. 

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll gauge his counteroffer. If it's reasonable (close to $140), I'll consider accepting. If it's too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum. 

If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Opportunity Cost:** While $130 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's counteroffer shows his interest in the product. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **John's Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so I can afford to be more demanding with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, perhaps $145. I'll emphasize the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. This creates pressure on Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  This product really is top-notch, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference at $145? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $145 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's quality to justify the price and create a sense of urgency.
* **Positive Framing:**  ""Fair price for both of us"" creates a collaborative tone and encourages Bob to see the deal as mutually beneficial.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick agreement at $145, which would be a good outcome for me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John, as further negotiation might not yield a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $145 is still a bit too high. I'm thinking more like $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  There's little room for further negotiation, and it's unlikely he'll budge much more.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150, which is much closer to my desired price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation with Bob would likely be time-consuming and not result in a significantly higher offer. 

**Strategy:**

While it's disappointing to lose out on a potential sale with Bob, my priority is to maximize my profit. Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price, saving me time and effort."
