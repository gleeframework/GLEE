Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be a great value for you, and I'm offering it to you for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, even if he doesn't reach your ideal $150. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential for a higher profit outweighs sticking to your minimum.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than $80. If you had additional information, you might adjust your strategy accordingly."
