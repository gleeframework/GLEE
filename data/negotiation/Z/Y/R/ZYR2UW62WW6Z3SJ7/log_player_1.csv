"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. This product is valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we start at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $650,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Selling to John is also a possibility, but I'd prefer to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see its full potential. Let's split the difference. How about $900,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring a few more rounds to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm ready to make a final concession.  How about $850,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget.  Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $810,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  However, we're getting close to the end of our negotiations.  I'll counteroffer one more time and then consider selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $810,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's find common ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $830,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 830000}
