"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. This product is valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see its full potential. Let's split the difference. How about $900,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm ready to make a final concession.  How about $850,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget.  Let's seal the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $810,000? This is my final offer.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $810,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's find common ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $830,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  This is my final offer.",830000.0,Alice,7,
