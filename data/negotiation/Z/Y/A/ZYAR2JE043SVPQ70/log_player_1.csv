Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we are still several rounds away from our deadline. It's too early to accept an offer significantly below the product's worth to both of us. We'll try to negotiate him up further."
