"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000. This would still allow you a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
