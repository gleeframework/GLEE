Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. It's incredibly valuable and I know you'll benefit greatly from it. I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth this much, it hints at significant value (""incredibly valuable,"" ""benefit greatly""). This leaves room for Bob to be curious and potentially justify the price in his mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" suggests a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage rather than immediately rejecting a high price.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts the $1,750,000, you've earned more than your minimum.
2. **Leave room for negotiation:**  You can always come down in price if needed, with John as a safety net."
