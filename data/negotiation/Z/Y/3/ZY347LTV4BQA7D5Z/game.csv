,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, which is a good compromise for both of us. It's a fair price that allows you to get closer to your target and keeps me within my spending limits. Let's make this deal happen.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $9,750. It's a bit more than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
