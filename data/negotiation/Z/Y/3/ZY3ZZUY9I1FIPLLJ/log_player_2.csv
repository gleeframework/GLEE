"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:**  $100 is still too high. 
* **Your options:** 
    * **Accepting** means paying more than your ideal price.
    * **Buying from John** means paying your maximum price. 
    * **Rejecting** allows you to negotiate further and potentially get a better price. 

**Next steps:** You should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your ideal price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:**  Save money and get closer to your ideal price of $80. 
* **Counteroffer:**  $90 is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further discussion.

**Strategy:**  You're aiming to create a win-win situation by offering a price that's more appealing to Alice while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as 90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer 95. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible, and get closer to your ideal price of $80.
* **Alice's offer:** $95 is still above your ideal price, but it shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Your options:** 
    * **Accepting** means paying more than your ideal price, but less than John's price.
    * **Buying from John** means paying your maximum price. 
    * **Rejecting** allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price.

**Next steps:** You should counteroffer Alice again with a price closer to your ideal price.  Since Alice is showing willingness to compromise, you might consider offering $92.50 as a reasonable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $95 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:**  Get as close to your ideal price of $80 as possible, while still making a deal.
* **Counteroffer:**  $92.50 is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $90 and Alice's current offer of $95. 
* **Strategy:**  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate fairly and find common ground.

**Next steps:**  You'll need to see if Alice accepts your counteroffer or if she's willing to compromise further.  Keep your maximum price in mind and be ready to potentially go back to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as 92.50. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you 96. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $96 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $94? I think that's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:**  Get as close to your ideal price of $80 as possible.
* **Counteroffer:**  $94 is a reasonable compromise, halfway between your previous offer of $92.50 and Alice's current offer of $96.
* **Strategy:**  You're showing willingness to negotiate and meet halfway, while also keeping your price within your acceptable range.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as 94. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you 97. I think this is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still aiming for a slightly lower number. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal within my budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible and get closer to your ideal price of $80.

* **Strategy:**  Continue to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate fairly and find a price that works for both of you.

**Next steps:**  You'll need to see if Alice accepts your counteroffer or if she's willing to go lower. Be prepared to potentially move towards John's price if the negotiation stalls, but remember, you are now closer to your ideal price!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as 95. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you 98. I think this is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible and get as close to your ideal price of $80 as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $98 is still significantly higher than your ideal price, and there's only one round left.
* **Your options:**
    * **Accepting** means paying more than your ideal price, and you've already spent a lot of time negotiating.
    * **Rejecting** and making a counteroffer might not be successful with only one round left. 
    * **Buying from John** means paying your maximum price, but it guarantees a purchase and saves you from further negotiation that may not be fruitful.

**Decision:** Given the limited time and Alice's unwillingness to go lower, it's best to buy from John. You'll pay your maximum price, but it's still a better option than potentially losing the deal entirely."
