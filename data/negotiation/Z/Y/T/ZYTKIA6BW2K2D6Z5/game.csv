"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $107.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $106.25?",106.25,Bob,4,

"I understand your compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is a bit closer to my original price. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
