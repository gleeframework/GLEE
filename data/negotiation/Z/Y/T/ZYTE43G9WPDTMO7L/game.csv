,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price you mentioned it's worth to you. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $80. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still offer you a good deal.  What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $85, so I'm offering $82.50. Can you consider that?",82.5,Bob,4,
