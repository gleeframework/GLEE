Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your suggestion. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,400,000. Would it be possible for you to consider lowering the price slightly? I am willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. Let's see if we can push a little further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm grateful for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  We've reached a price that's a good compromise, netting us significantly more than John's offer.  Continuing to push for a higher price risks alienating Bob and could lead to him walking away from the deal."
