"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product, and I believe this reflects a fair value.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move forward with another vendor if necessary.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $950,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. It's closer to my range, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident this is a reasonable offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",925000.0,Bob,6,
