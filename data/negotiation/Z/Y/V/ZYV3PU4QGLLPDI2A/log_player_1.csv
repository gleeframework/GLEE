"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I have 8 more rounds and the option to sell to John for my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product, which is a good deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I have 6 rounds left and the option to sell to John for my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8,900. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}
