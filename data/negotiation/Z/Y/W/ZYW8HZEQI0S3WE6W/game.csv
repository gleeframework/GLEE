I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. Is that something you'd be interested in?,180.0,Alice,1,

"That's a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $140 right now.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've already priced the product competitively. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $160. Is that more to your liking?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $150? That would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you think $150 is a fair price, but I've already invested a lot in this product, so I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $165, which is still a great deal considering its value to you.",165.0,Alice,5,
