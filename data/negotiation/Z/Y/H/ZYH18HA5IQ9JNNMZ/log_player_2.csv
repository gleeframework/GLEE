Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're trying to drive the price down, but I'm not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll offer you a counteroffer of $940,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to a price that's close to my target. I'd rather avoid the risk of further negotiation and the potential of having to buy from John at a higher price."
