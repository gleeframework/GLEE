"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $925,000?  It's a good price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal quickly.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're trying to drive the price down, but I'm not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll offer you a counteroffer of $940,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",940000.0,Alice,5,
