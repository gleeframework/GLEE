Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I want to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a little ways off my ideal price. How about $13,750? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to come away happy."", ""product_price"": 13750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to go down to $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, $13,250 is a good compromise and  a decent return.  It's better than selling to John for $12,000."
