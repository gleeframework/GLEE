I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to accept."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $115?  This is a great deal for a product you value at $120."", ""product_price"": 115}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $107 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $112. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 112}
