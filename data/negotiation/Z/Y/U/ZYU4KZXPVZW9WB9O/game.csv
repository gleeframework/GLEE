"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $115?  This is a great deal for a product you value at $120.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and do $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $107 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $112. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",112.0,Alice,5,
