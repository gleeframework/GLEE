"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the potential in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a profitable margin for you.  Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has tremendous value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still staying within my budget. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $920,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I believe it's still a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with $920,000.  It's getting close, but I'm going to have to stick to my last offer of $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.  Let me know your final decision.",900000.0,Bob,6,
