"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer $82.50. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",82.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. We stand by our original price of $95, as it reflects the true value and quality of the product. However, I am open to discussing a compromise that benefits both parties. Would you be interested in a price closer to $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $90. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $87.50. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",87.5,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $89 for the product. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, aiming to find a balance between the value of the product and our respective positions. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",89.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $89. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $85. This is my last attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $80.",85.0,Bob,6,
