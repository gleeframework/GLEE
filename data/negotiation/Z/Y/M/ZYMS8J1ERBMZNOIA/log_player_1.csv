Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I believe it provides significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 15000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's advantageous to start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to discuss the price, signaling flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down to a price above $12,000 while ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on a sale altogether."
