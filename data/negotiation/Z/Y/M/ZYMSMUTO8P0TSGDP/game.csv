"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $12000 for it. Would you be willing to negotiate further?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a great price, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13500 is a step in the right direction, I still feel that $12000 would be a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these two prices?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
