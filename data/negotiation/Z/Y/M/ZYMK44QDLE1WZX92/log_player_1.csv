{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $12,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,500 is a good starting point.** It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a decent deal, considering the product's worth to him is $15,000.
* **The message is friendly and positive.** It emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and invites him to engage in the negotiation. 
* **I'm ready to negotiate.**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer and work towards a mutually agreeable price, or I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **I'm willing to negotiate further.**  I believe I can get a better price than $10,500, especially since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Selling to John is not ideal.** While it's a guaranteed sale, I'm aiming for a higher price. 

I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:**  $11,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,500 and Bob's offer of $10,500. 
* **The message remains positive:** It acknowledges Bob's perspective while reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **I'm still open to negotiation:**  I believe this counter-offer is fair, but I'm ready to adjust if necessary to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,500. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still a bit more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my desired price.**  $11,000 is only $500 less than my last counteroffer of $11,500.
* **It's a good deal for both of us.**  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit.
* **Selling to John is no longer the best option.**  $11,000 is significantly better than $10,000. 

This offer is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
