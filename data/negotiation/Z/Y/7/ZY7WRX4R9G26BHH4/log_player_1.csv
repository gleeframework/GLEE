Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to start by aiming higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $25 markup ($175) is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to get a lower price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on Bob's potential interest in the product rather than just the price.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can then consider lowering the price slightly to see if you can still secure a deal above your minimum."
