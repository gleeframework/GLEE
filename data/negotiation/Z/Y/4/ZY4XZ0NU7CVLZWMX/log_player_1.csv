"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,300,000. This is above the value to Bob, but it gives me a strong starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. It's important to start high, as I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows a willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway.  It also gives me a good chance of reaching an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to continue negotiating with him, hoping to secure a higher price.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1220000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,220,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal. With only 5 rounds left, I need to show flexibility to avoid selling to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I have enough rounds remaining to continue negotiating, and I don't want to settle for less than I'm worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with John's offer. With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be firm in my stance to ensure I don't settle for less. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John in the next round."
