Alice's offer is very close to my maximum price.  However, I'm going to try to push for a slightly lower price, aiming to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice has finally reached my maximum price. It's time to accept the offer and buy the product. While I could technically still negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge any more, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at the same price."
