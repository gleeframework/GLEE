# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Even though Alice's price is higher than her personal value ($9,500 vs. $8,000), it's still lower than John's price of $10,000.
* **You're still saving money.** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $500 compared to buying from John."
