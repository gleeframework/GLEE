"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your target. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Anchor the Price:** By starting at $1,600,000, you establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind. This makes your eventual target price seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Gauge Bob's Reaction:** This first offer is as much about understanding Bob's perception of value as it is about closing a deal immediately. His response will give you insights for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $900,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum ($1,200,000) and your initial offer. Accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between your offer and Bob's offer, indicating room for negotiation. You can afford to counter-offer and try to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John for your minimum price provides leverage. You don't need to rush into a deal with Bob unless it's advantageous."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your business."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** While rejecting Bob's offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate by significantly lowering your initial price. 
* **Justify the Price:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you reinforce the idea that your offer is reasonable and grounded in objective factors.
* **Highlight Product Benefits:**  By subtly reiterating the product's value proposition specifically for Bob's business, you aim to shift his focus from the price to the potential return on investment.
* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer creates a scenario where a future concession from either party could lead to a mutually acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe the product's value aligns more closely with my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 exceeds your absolute minimum price of $1,200,000.  
* **Strong Counteroffer:**  Bob significantly increased his offer from $900,000, indicating a serious intent to purchase.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate returns, as opposed to the uncertainty of further rounds or selling to John."
