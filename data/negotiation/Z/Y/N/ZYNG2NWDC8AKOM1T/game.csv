"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd like to start with an offer of $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to make a serious commitment at $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth more than that to me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
