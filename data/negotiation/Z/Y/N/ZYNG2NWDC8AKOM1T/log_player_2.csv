"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and start counter-offering to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd like to start with an offer of $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to make a serious commitment at $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth more than that to me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While we're getting closer, I don't want to risk going over my budget, and John is offering a guaranteed price within my budget. It's better to secure the product from John than to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially lose out on the deal."
