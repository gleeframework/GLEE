""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it for that price guarantees a sale but leaves money on the table.  Offering it close to your minimum ($1,200,000) risks him rejecting it.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's perceived value, maximizing the chance of him accepting while still securing a significant profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint can encourage a quicker decision from Bob."
