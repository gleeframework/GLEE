"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
