Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I will get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial, and $950,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This offer represents a significant saving compared to your initial valuation."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk of continuing negotiations is currently outweighed by the potential for a higher sale price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, Bob's increments are getting smaller, and we're now at a significant profit margin above John's offer. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate."
