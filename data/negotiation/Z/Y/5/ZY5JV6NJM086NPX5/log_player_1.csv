Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it makes lower offers (closer to $80) seem more reasonable. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it. You can gradually lower the price, but don't go below your $80 minimum."
