**Reasoning:**

$65 is a good price, but I'm trying to save as much money as possible. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to push Alice to meet me halfway.  $50 is still a reasonable price, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice has come down to $60, which is within my budget and a better price than John's.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
