"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is quite high. We have room to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $95 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to bring the price closer to our desired range while gauging Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but we still have room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

We acknowledge Alice's price reduction and propose a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($85) and our previous counteroffer ($70).  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $77 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, and $82 is a reasonable price, well within our $100 budget. There's little to be gained by continuing to negotiate, and we risk pushing Alice away completely."
