"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for sale. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $10,000 to me. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping you'll see it that way too.",12000.0,Alice,5,
