"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than our $100 maximum. A starting offer of $80 gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite & Direct:** We want to keep the negotiation amicable while clearly stating our price target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Limit:** Alice is now offering the product at our maximum price limit of $100. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. John is also offering the product for $100.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now prevents further back-and-forth and secures the product."
