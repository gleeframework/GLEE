Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to drop my price that much further.  I'll see if we can find some common ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000, and I'm starting to think that buying from John for $800,000 might be a better option for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, I've already made significant concessions, and Bob seems unwilling to budge further.  Rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially losing a better deal, I'll sell to John at a much higher price."
