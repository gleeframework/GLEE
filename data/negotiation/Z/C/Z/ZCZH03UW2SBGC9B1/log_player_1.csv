"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair price reflecting its worth."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $13,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value I'm getting. Let's work together to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $11,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting. Let's find a meeting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer at $9,500 is a loss compared to John's guaranteed $10,000.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed sale."
