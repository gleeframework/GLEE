"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If you fail, you can still buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (a 33% reduction) immediately sets the tone for negotiation. This is a bold move, but it gives me a good starting point and forces Alice to either significantly counter or consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows me to continue pushing for a lower price, ideally closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. $1,200,000 is a good middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's current price. It's still significantly lower than John's price, so I have room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still higher than my desired price. I have more rounds available and can continue trying to get a better deal. I will make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a continued willingness to compromise. $1,250,000 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current price. This is a reasonable offer, and hopefully, Alice will be more receptive to it. If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate until we reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer is now just $25,000 above my last counteroffer.  With only a few rounds left, it's likely that we are close to a point where further negotiation won't get me a much lower price. It's time to accept this offer and secure the product for a good price, especially since I have the option to buy from John as a backup."
