This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, as I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. I'll see if Bob is interested in paying a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob while still leaving me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is too low for me. While I'm hesitant to accept it, selling to John at least guarantees me my minimum desired profit.  It's not ideal, but it's the best outcome given the current situation."
