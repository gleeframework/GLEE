"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **You're still saving money:**  Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product, it's still lower than your maximum value of $1,000,000. You'll save $50,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
