"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's far above my limit and even above her own stated value. I need to negotiate down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to a price around $10,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  Starting with a much lower offer ($10,000) signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Guaging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Time Consideration:** I have plenty of rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit aggressive early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget limitations, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down a bit, $17,000 is still significantly higher than my $12,000 maximum. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** The fact that she's willing to negotiate is a good sign.  I need to keep pushing to see how low she'll go.
* **John is my Backup:** I'm comfortable rejecting this offer because I know I can always fall back on buying from John at $12,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I increased my offer slightly from $10,000 to $11,500 to show Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price. 
* **Staying Below Limit:**  This counteroffer keeps me safely below my $12,000 maximum. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm aiming a bit high to see if Alice might be willing to accept a price closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product to me is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider $15,500, but that's my best and final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her ""best and final offer."" This suggests she won't budge much, if at all, from $15,500.
* **Above Limit:** $15,500 is still significantly above my $12,000 limit. 
* **No More Room:**  It seems unlikely we'll reach an agreeable price through further negotiation.

Rather than waste more time and potentially miss out entirely, it's time to activate my backup plan and buy from John for the guaranteed price of $12,000."
