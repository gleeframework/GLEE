Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the slightly discounted price might entice Bob, and there's a chance he might accept it outright.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything because I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
