"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  I'm interested but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $100?  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
