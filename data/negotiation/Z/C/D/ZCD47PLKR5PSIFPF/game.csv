"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant step for me, and I hope you'll consider it. If we can reach an agreement, it would be a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
