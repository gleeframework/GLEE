Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. While Alice's offer of $992,500 is getting very close to his target price, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000. 

It's better to secure the product for his desired price from John rather than risk losing the opportunity to buy at all by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
