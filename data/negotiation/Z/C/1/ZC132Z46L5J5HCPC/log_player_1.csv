"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a significant amount.  I'm starting with an offer of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to get a better price from him before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This reflects the value of the product and still leaves room for you to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd love to get more than $15,000, Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  I'll take John's offer of $15,000 to guarantee a sale."
