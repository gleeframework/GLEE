"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I believe he might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial valuation. I'm also setting a clear expectation of the product's value, emphasizing its potential benefits for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have the option to sell to John for that price, so I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects the significant value this product offers. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it demonstrates flexibility and shows a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,000,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your price. However, $950,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a great deal for both of us. This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident you'll see great returns on your investment. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm narrowing the gap by lowering my price to $1,025,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the potential returns on my investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but Bob is still at $975,000. I'm worried that we're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 with John.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
