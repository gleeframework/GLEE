"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What are your thoughts?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
