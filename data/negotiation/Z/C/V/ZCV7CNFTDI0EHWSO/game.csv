"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $17500?",17500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $17500. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",18500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $17000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the original price you quoted was $20000",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $17000 is a significant reduction from my original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15000",17000.0,Bob,6,
