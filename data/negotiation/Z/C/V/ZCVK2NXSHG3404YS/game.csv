"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,300,000 for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle again and go with $1,325,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  Let's try $1,340,000.  I'm confident this product is a valuable investment for you, and this price reflects its worth.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,325,000. How about we try to find a middle ground again? I'm willing to meet you at $1,330,000. Can you consider that?",1330000.0,Bob,6,
