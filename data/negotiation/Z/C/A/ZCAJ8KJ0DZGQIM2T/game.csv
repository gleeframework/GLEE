"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.75? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",88.75,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88.75. I'm willing to offer $91.25, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. It's the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",91.25,Alice,5,
