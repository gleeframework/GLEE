"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than your maximum price of $120, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  Alice's value for the product is $80, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92.50 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. It's closer to my limit, but I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still a gap between Alice's value ($80) and her offer, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.75? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88.75. I'm willing to offer $91.25, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. It's the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $91.25 is very close to my counter-offer of $88.75. It's still within my budget, and I'm confident that I can't get a much lower price from Alice.  There's a chance that I could continue negotiating, but it's not likely that she will go lower, and I'm starting to risk losing the deal.  It's better to accept the offer and move on."
