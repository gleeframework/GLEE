"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I know John will pay that. This will give Bob a clear understanding of my value for the product and hopefully prompt a counter-offer that we can work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable value for the product.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage negotiation.  At $900,000, I'm still well above Bob's offer, and I'm confident that there's room for us to find a mutually agreeable price."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not yet willing to drop this low, so I'll continue to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both be happy, but I'm also staying firm on my value for the product."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  I'm getting closer to a point where it might be worth it to sell to Bob, but I need to keep my value in mind.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is taking too long, and Bob's offers are not getting close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
