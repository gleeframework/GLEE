"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value. This is a good strategy to see if Bob is willing to pay more than he initially thought.  I'm hoping he'll counter with something closer to my minimum value, but I'm always prepared to sell to John for $100 if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price that's closer to my value. I'm hoping Bob will find this price acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum of $100.  I'd prefer to get $100, but I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for the same price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
