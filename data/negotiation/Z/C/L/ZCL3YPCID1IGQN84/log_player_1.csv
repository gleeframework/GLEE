"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,500 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

While Bob's offer is a bit higher, it's still far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. There's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."

The negotiations with Bob haven't produced a satisfactory outcome.  He seems unwilling to go significantly higher than $8,500, which is still well below my minimum acceptable price.  Since John is offering my desired price, it makes sense to sell to him and avoid any further risk or potential loss."
