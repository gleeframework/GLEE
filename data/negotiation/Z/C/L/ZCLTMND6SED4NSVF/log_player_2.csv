"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay no more than $120, so starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $100, we signal that we're serious about buying but also expect Alice to move on her price. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is friendly but clearly states our price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $120? This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal, as we can't get a better price from John."
