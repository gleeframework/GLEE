Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price tag.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Adding a time limit and presenting it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" can encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) might lead to immediate rejection.
* **Negotiation Room:** This high offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price higher than your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer."
