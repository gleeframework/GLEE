"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's worth.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $975,000.  At this point, the potential savings are minimal compared to John's offer, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
