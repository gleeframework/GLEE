"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1100000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to offer you $900000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and your own valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
