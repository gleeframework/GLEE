Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Leave Room for Counteroffers:**  Offering $180 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and still allows you to potentially make a profit above your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to go as high as $130. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $130 is below your minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer to his perceived value, you still have room to negotiate before resorting to selling to John. You'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? That's a significant price drop on my end and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 155}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can be effective. By suggesting a price that's halfway between your last offer and Bob's counteroffer, you're signaling flexibility and a desire to compromise.
* **Highlight the Compromise:** Emphasizing that you're making a significant move from your original price might make Bob more amenable to the deal.
* **Stay Above Your Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps the price above your minimum acceptable amount ($150), ensuring you'll make a profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $140.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest counteroffer is still below your minimum acceptable price. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, continuing to haggle might not result in a significantly better offer. Selling to John for your guaranteed $150 ensures you don't lose out on a profit and avoids further negotiation."
