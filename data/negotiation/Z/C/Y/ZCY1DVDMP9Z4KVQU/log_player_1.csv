Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! $2,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,987,500.  This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my commitment to securing the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,987,500

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers while we're moving downwards. $1,987,500 is a significant amount and further haggling might risk losing the deal. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk getting a lower offer later or having to settle for John's price."
