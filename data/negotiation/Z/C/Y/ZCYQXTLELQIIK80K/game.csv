"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",925000.0,Alice,3,
