# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:

You are still $800 above your maximum price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target."
