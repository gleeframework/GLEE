You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to get a price higher than the product's worth to her ($12,000). 
* While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John.
* Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her actual valuation. 
* Even if she doesn't budge, you're safe knowing John will sell it to you for $15,000."
