Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys it from you for his maximum. 
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You want to find a price that's significantly more than your minimum but still attractive enough for Bob to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" you subtly create a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" reinforces that this isn't just any product.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 allows you to capture a large portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a $150,000 incentive to buy from you instead of seeking alternatives.
* **Confidence:** By stating you believe it's a fair offer, you project confidence in your pricing.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Don't Reveal John:** Never let Bob know you have another buyer. This weakens your position."
