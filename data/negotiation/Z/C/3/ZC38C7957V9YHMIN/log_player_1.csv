"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a further compromise, but still above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to close the deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although I'd prefer more, the rounds are getting short and I'm running the risk of getting a lower price if I keep rejecting. $11,000 is a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000."
