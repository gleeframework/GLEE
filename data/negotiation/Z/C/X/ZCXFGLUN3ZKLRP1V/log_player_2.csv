"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and John is offering the product for $120, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  Bob can immediately buy the product from John and be sure of a fair price."
