Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better, it's still above our ideal price and we haven't reached our limit with John yet. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims for a price closer to the middle ground between Alice's last offer and our previous counteroffer. It keeps the negotiation moving while staying within a reasonable range of our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $75, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm at $85, and while that's close to our budget, we know we can get it for $80 from John. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
