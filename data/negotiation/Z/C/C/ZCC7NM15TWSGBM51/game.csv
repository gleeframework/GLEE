"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, after careful consideration, I'm afraid I need to make a counteroffer of my own. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. My new offer is $1550000. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I've reviewed our previous negotiations and I believe we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000, which is slightly above your last offer but still within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead us to closing the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1500000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more in the range of $1600000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at last. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I respect the value you place on the product, I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I am prepared to offer $1550000 as my final counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your dedication to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1550000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be confident that we're on the same page. I'm thinking $1625000 is a fair price for this unique item. It's my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal at this price.",1625000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I've evaluated all our previous discussions and the product's value, and I believe we're very close to a fair price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I hope this brings us to a satisfactory conclusion.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer, but I need to be confident that it's a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm thinking $1650000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",1650000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe we've reached the most reasonable price point for both of us. I am willing to purchase the product for $1625000. I hope this brings us to a successful conclusion of our negotiations.",1625000.0,Bob,10,
