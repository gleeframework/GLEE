Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $85 is still below my minimum price, but I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $87.5 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50.  How about we split the difference and settle on $88.50? It's a fair price that ensures we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
