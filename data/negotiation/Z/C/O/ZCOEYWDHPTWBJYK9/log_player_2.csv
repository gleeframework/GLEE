"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your limit, it's still not a great deal. You're aiming to save as much as possible, so you'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is getting closer to your goal, you can still try to push for a better price. You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate and she's already come down from her initial offer.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50.  How about we split the difference and settle on $88.50? It's a fair price that ensures we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and you're only $3.50 away from your desired price.  Accepting her offer at $88.50 is the best option here, as it's likely you won't get a much better deal in the remaining rounds. Continuing to negotiate could risk her getting frustrated and reverting to her previous offer, or potentially making a counteroffer that's higher than $88.50."
