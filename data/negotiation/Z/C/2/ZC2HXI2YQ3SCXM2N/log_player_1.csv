Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to let it go for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $115 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing you to potentially earn even more. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. 

This strategy prioritizes getting the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
