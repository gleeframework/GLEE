"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and your desire to sell.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's true value and my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's try to reach a final agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
