"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750.  It's a good compromise, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is still less than my ideal price, it's a decent compromise and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and I don't want to miss out on the potential profit."
