"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer you a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $800,000.  Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
