Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value to see if I can get a better deal.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will try to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $72.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 72.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $65 was a bit low.  How about we settle at $70 even? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's likely that he won't go higher. I'll take the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
