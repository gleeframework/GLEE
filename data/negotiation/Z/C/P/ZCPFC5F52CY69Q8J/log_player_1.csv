{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $950,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially considering the value of the product to Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product.  This price still leaves significant room for profit on your end. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but I'm going to have to stick to my previous price of $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant saving for you compared to the value you place on the product.  I'm confident that this is a fair price that will allow both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit.  I hope we can find a way to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement on his previous offer and allows me to avoid potentially losing the deal to John."
