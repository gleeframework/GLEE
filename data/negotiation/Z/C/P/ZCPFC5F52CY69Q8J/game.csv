"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product.  This price still leaves significant room for profit on your end. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but I'm going to have to stick to my previous price of $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant saving for you compared to the value you place on the product.  I'm confident that this is a fair price that will allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit.  I hope we can find a way to close the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
