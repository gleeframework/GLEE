"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be attractive to him, leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my earnings, but also want to keep Bob engaged for potential future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum. However, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,000? It's still a good deal for you considering the value you've mentioned, and we can hopefully close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum value and Bob's offer.  $12,000 is still a decent profit for me, and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is equal to his perceived value, and although it is still below my minimum value, I'm at a point where I'm willing to accept it. It's a decent profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate.  I can always sell to John later if I need to, but this is a good enough price to close the deal now."
