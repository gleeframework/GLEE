"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,000? It's still a good deal for you considering the value you've mentioned, and we can hopefully close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
