,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a significant discount from my original offer, and still leaves room for both of us to be happy.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  If we can meet in the middle, I'd be happy to buy it from you.",100.0,Bob,4,
