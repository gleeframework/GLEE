You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal. You have a safety net with John's offer, so you can be aggressive in your counteroffer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer.  This is a good price considering your maximum budget is $1,500,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of Alice getting a better offer elsewhere or you potentially losing out on the product altogether."
