Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I receive fair value for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This compromise allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk she'll become less flexible or you'll simply waste time. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price you're comfortable with and avoids the risk of potentially paying more to John."
