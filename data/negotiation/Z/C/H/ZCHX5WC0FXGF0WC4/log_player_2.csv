{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It's not worthwhile to accept this offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $12,000. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, but it's still within my budget and a good starting point for negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I'll try to negotiate further by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $13,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer.  This is a compromise that might be more appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal. If Alice rejects this counteroffer, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $13,500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. This could potentially be the tipping point for her to accept, as it's closer to her desired price and still within my budget. If she rejects, I'll move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has rejected all my counteroffers, and her latest offer of $14,000 is still outside my budget. I've reached my limit for negotiation. It's now more advantageous to buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $12,000."
