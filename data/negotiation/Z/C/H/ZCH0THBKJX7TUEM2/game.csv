"Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $80, which is my maximum budget for this product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $110. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to spend $80 right now. If you're willing to go down to that, we have a deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $105. This is my final offer, so if you want the product, this is your last chance.",105.0,Alice,5,
