Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to convey the product's value and justify the high price without seeming overly aggressive or greedy.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the best possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
