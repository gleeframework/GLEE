"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset worth $15,000 at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely do better. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I am willing to consider $13,000 as a fair offer for the product. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to Bob's initial counteroffer of $13,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as he is getting the product for $2,000 less than he'd pay John. There's no guarantee that Bob could get a lower price if he continues to negotiate, and he risks losing the deal altogether."
