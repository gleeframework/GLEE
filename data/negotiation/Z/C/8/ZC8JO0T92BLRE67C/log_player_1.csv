"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'm confident Bob will be motivated to negotiate, as the product is worth $800,000 to him.  This leaves room for a compromise while still securing a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial ask.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully, it's an attractive price for Bob.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to him, so I believe this price will be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is getting closer to my desired profit, I'm still confident I can get a bit more.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for just a small profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm making another small concession, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.  $890,000 is a fair price for both of us, and it shows Bob I'm serious about closing a deal.  He's already rejected $900,000, so I'm confident he'll see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher profit, and I'm confident I can get it. While $880,000 is a good price, I believe I can secure a better deal. With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000} 
```

I'm making a small counteroffer to Bob.  $885,000 is a fair price for both of us, and it shows him I'm serious about closing a deal.  I'm confident that he will see the value in this offer.  We are now in the 7th round, and I have 3 rounds remaining before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are in the 8th round, with only two rounds left before I must make a final decision. Bob's offer of $870,000 is not far from what John is offering, and with limited time, it's not worth risking the deal with Bob. I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $800,000 to guarantee the sale and secure a profit."
