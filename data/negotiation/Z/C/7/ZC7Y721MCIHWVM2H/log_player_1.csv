Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn a good profit.
* **Below your minimum:** It leaves some room for you to make concessions if necessary.
* **A reasonable starting point:**  It's a clear and straightforward offer that sets the stage for further negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum desired profit. You have a better offer from John and the potential to get closer to your target price by negotiating with Bob.  

By rejecting his offer, you can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired range and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise because:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's above your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a decent profit.
* **It's clear and concise:** This keeps the negotiation focused and avoids unnecessary distractions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's the best we can both do to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum.  Selling to John would guarantee a profit of $10,000, which is a much better deal than selling to Bob for $8,750.

You can reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, but it's becoming clear that he might not be willing to meet your price.  Given the certainty of a sale to John for a higher price, it's wise to secure that deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250 as a final offer.  This gives you a good price and keeps me above my minimum. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's a little closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Is above your minimum:** It ensures you're still making a profit.
* **Is a final offer:** It puts pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

By making this counteroffer, you're giving Bob one last chance to meet you in the middle while still maintaining your profit margin. If he rejects this, it's time to move on to John's guaranteed offer."
