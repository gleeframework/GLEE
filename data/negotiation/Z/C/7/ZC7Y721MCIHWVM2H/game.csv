"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's the best we can both do to make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250 as a final offer.  This gives you a good price and keeps me above my minimum. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
