"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget of $8,000. I need to negotiate a much lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start counter-offering and hopefully reach a price that's more acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product would really benefit you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I want to keep negotiating and see if I can push for a lower price. Rejecting allows me to counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap here. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between what we both consider fair.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my absolute best offer. This price takes into account the true value of what you're getting.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, I am determined to save as much money as possible.  I want to continue negotiating and see if I can push for a lower price, potentially within the $13,000-$14,000 range.  There are still several rounds left, so I have time to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $14,000. This is a good compromise and reflects my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
