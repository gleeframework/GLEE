Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000 (her safety net with John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential profit margin of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000).

**Alice's Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair price, allowing you to reap substantial benefits from your investment."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Targeting the High End:** Alice starts by aiming high, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential for profit, justifying the high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer:
    * Gives Alice a strong chance of securing a significant portion of the potential profit.
    * Leaves Bob with a perceived gain, as he's still getting it for less than his valuation.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** Alice makes a great deal, earning $350,000 over her minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  Alice has room to lower the price slightly, still aiming for above $1,100,000 to secure a better profit than with John. 
* **Bob Rejects:**  Alice moves on to John, securing her minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Alice could start with a different offer, but the key is to aim high initially while ensuring the offer is justifiable and enticing to Bob."
