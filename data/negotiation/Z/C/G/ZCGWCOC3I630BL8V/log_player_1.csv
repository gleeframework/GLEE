Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to increase the chances of Bob accepting my offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $12,000, I leave myself room to negotiate down if Bob makes a lower counteroffer, while still ensuring a profit for myself.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I am aware of John's offer, and I can choose to sell to him at any moment if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am interested in discussing a potential compromise. How about we aim for $10,000? I hope this suggestion is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Better Offer:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, I believe there's still potential to get a better offer from him.  I can try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can reach a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $10,000 is tempting, it's still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000.  This gives you a significant discount while ensuring I can still cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is clear and concise, stating the new offer and the rationale behind it. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept Offer:**  If Bob accepts my offer, I will sell the product to him for $11,000.
* **Reject Offer:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can choose to either sell to John for $15,000 or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've been considering the value of the product and the cost involved, and I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose we set the price at $9,500. This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget, while still providing you with a fair return for your effort and investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  I've already made a significant concession by dropping to $11,000.  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is much higher than Bob's offer.  There is no reason to continue negotiating with Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:**  I am confident that John's offer is the best option for me, ensuring I receive the highest possible price for my product."
