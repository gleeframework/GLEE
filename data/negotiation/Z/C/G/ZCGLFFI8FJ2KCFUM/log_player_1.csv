"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay. It's important to start high, as I can always lower the price later. I also want to leave room for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is still a significant profit margin.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product. I hope this price will entice Bob to accept the offer, but it's still above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value.  While I would ideally like to get more, accepting his offer will allow me to sell the product without further negotiation.  I also don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same amount."
