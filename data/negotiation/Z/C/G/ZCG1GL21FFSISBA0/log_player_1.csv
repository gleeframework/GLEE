Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This allows some room for bargaining while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500? It's still a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is still slightly below my ideal price, it's a good compromise considering the negotiation so far.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale close to my desired value without the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale to John."
