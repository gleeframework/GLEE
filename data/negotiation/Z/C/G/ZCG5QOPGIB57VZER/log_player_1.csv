"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with a zero profit margin. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort.  While I could accept and sell to him, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and hopefully enough to entice Bob to come closer to my desired range.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unattractive. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he'll walk away completely. With only four rounds left, the risk of losing the deal is too high.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale and secures a profit for me."
