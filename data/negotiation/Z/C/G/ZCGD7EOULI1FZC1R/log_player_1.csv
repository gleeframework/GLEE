**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently incrementing his offers in smaller amounts and is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's beneficial for you within the remaining rounds.  

It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risking a lower final offer from Bob or a stalemate in the negotiation."
