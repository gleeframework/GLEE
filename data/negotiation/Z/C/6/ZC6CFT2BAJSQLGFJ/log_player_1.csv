Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $8,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
