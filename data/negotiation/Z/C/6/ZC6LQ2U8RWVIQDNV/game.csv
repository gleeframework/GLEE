"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I can't do $11,000 but to show I'm serious about making a deal, how about $12,100?",12100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're really making me work for this!  I could possibly stretch to $11,500, but that's my absolute limit.",11500.0,Bob,6,
