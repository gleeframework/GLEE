"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we work something out closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
