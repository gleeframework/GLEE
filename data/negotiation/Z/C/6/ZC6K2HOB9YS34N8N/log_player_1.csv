{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage him to buy it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum value for the product. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further.  $115 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum price. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same amount. Accepting this offer is the best way to maximize my profit."
