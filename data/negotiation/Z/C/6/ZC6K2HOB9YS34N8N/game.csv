"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further.  $115 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to my target price.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price. What do you say?",120.0,Bob,4,
