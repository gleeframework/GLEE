"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. Can we meet in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 is certainly appealing, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I could consider $1,650,000, which represents a significant movement on my part and acknowledges your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the movement on your part, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,650,000, which would be $1,575,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1575000.0,Bob,4,
