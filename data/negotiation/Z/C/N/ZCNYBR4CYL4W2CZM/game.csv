"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business.",9800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time.",9200.0,Alice,5,
