"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal, considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $1,200,000 as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit high.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, with the hope of driving the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still only comfortable with $1,250,000. This is a fair price that gives us both some room to breathe. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1250000 is still below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $1300000? This is a good price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal.  $1,300,000 is still above his desired price, and with 5 rounds remaining, there's still room for further negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to push for a price closer to his $1,200,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1275000. This would be a win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $1275000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1325000. Let's see if we can close this deal on this price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is not budging much on her price.  Bob has already tried to negotiate down to $1,275,000, and Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above his target.  With only 3 rounds left, the chance of reaching a mutually acceptable price is low. It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $1,200,000, guaranteeing a purchase within his budget."
