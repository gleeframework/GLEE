"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by its creators. Considering its high quality and unique features, we believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. I am offering this exceptional item to you for $100, hoping to provide you with a great deal while ensuring we cover our costs and maintain our business operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price, closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the information about the product. However, $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A low counteroffer helps us understand how much lower Alice is willing to go. 
* **Work towards our target price:**  Our goal is to get as close to $80 as possible, and starting low gives us more bargaining power. 

By being polite and expressing our budget constraints, we hope to encourage Alice to engage in a negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your feedback. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to offer the product to you for $75, which I believe strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $75 is a great price, saving us $5 compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely we'll get a much better offer from Alice, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal."
