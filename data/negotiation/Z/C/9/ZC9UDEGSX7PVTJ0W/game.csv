"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $2,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort in adjusting the price, Alice. However, I still feel that $2,100,000 is beyond my current budget. Would you consider reducing the price further to $1,900,000? This would bring us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,050,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",2050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet $2,050,000. Would you consider bringing the price down to $1,950,000? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is within my financial means.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
