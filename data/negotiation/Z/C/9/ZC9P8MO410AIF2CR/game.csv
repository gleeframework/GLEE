"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $17000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's make this happen!",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $15250?  That's closer to my budget and a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal.",15250.0,Bob,4,
