"Bob, I understand your perspective, and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750000 is a step closer, it's still below the value I've placed on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This reflects a fair compromise, considering the product's potential benefits to your business. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
