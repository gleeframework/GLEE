"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects a more agreeable middle ground, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, even though it's lower than her initial price. You have two options now:

1. **Reject and counteroffer:** You can try to negotiate further by making another counteroffer, hoping to bring the price down closer to your desired range.
2. **Buy from John:** This is still the safest option, as John's price is within your budget. 

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting and counteroffering is a slightly better strategy, as it might lead to a lower price than John's. However, the risk is that Alice might not accept your counteroffer and you'll end up buying from John anyway."
