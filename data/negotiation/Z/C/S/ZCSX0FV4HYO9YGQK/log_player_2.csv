"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to a price Bob can afford."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000. Would you consider $10,500? I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings to you. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving him $1,500 compared to accepting Alice's offer. There's a risk that Alice might come down in price further, but it's not worth the gamble given the potential savings and the limited rounds left."
