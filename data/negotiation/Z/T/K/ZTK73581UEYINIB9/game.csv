"Bob, I understand your budget, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $115. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it provides.",112.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really close to selling to John for $120, but I'm still willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $114? I know you're on a budget, and this is the best I can do.",114.0,Alice,5,
