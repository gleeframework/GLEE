"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're aiming to spend no more than $1,000,000.  Alice's offer is $250,000 over your target.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have room to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring whether Alice will come down.
* **John's offer is your safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed way to get the product for your maximum price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While her offer is closer to your target, it's still $150,000 over your limit. 
* **Negotiation continues:** There's still room for negotiation, and you're not desperate to buy immediately.
* **John's offer is your backup:** You can always walk away and buy from John if this deal falls through. 

You're in a good position to keep pushing for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $1,125,000 is only $125,000 lower than your previous counteroffer. She's not budging significantly.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to succeed:**  You've already made several counteroffers, and Alice keeps coming down by small amounts.  It seems she's unwilling to meet your price. 
* **John's offer is the best option:** You're closer to your goal price by buying from John, saving you a significant amount of money compared to Alice's current offer.  

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a reasonable price."
