(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to split the difference between Alice's initial price and his ideal price.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still setting a clear target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more conservative approach this time, only lowering the price by $500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $11,000. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Savings:**  $11,250 is a significant saving compared to John's price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the difference between his current offer ($11,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($11,250) is small.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small concessions.
* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away from the deal or losing interest, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.

Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of a broken negotiation."
