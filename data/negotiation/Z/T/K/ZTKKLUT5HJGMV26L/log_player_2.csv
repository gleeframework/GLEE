"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's no reason to immediately buy from John, as you have 10 rounds to reach a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate. This gives you room to compromise and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within your budget and a good price. It's not the absolute lowest price, but continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away or you reaching the 10-round limit and having to buy from John. Accepting the offer is the most efficient and cost-effective decision at this point."
