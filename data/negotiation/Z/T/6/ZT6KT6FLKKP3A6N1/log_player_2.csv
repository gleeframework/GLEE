"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial value of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still above your budget. You're still better off trying to negotiate further or buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair deal for both of us and avoids the hassle of negotiating any further."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $11,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still above your budget of $10,000. While she's clearly willing to negotiate, it seems like the gap between your desired price and her minimum is not going to close easily.  Given that you have a reliable alternative with John selling the product for $10,000, it's the best choice to go with John and avoid further negotiation."
