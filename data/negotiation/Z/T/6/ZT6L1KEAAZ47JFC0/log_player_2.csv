"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** To save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $15,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget.
* **Best Option:** Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear limit of $12,000.  Alice's opening offer is too high, and there are still rounds to negotiate. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** To save as much money as possible.
* **Initial Offer:**  Alice's offer of $15,000 was too high.
* **Counteroffer:** By offering $10,000, Bob is starting the negotiation with a significant discount.  This shows he's serious about buying but is willing to walk away if the price is too high.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a bold move, but it could be effective.  It establishes a firm position for Bob and leaves room for some give-and-take in the negotiations. If Alice is flexible, she may accept or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** To save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000, still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Best Option:**  Reject and continue negotiating.

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still more than Bob's budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to keep pushing for a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and Bob might be able to secure a more favorable deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  To save as much money as possible, ideally getting the product for $12,000 or less.
* **Previous Round:** Alice lowered her offer to $14,000, but it's still above Bob's budget.
* **Counteroffer:** By offering $11,000, Bob is showing that he's willing to pay more than his initial offer but still wants a discount. This keeps the negotiation moving.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that Bob is flexible and willing to compromise.  It's a good strategy to bridge the gap between Bob's budget and Alice's current offer. This might encourage Alice to come down further or accept the offer.  If she rejects, there are still rounds left to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,000, still above Bob's ideal price.
* **Best Option:** Reject and continue negotiating.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer again, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has already rejected a higher offer, showing his determination to get a better deal.  Rejecting again keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to continue pressing for a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and Bob might be able to get the product closer to his budget."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Get the product for his maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Previous Round:** Alice offered $13,000, which is still above Bob's budget.
* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is Bob's final offer, directly at his budget.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, starting at a low offer and gradually moving closer to his budget. This final offer demonstrates a serious intent to purchase the product. 
* **Time Pressure:** There are only a few rounds left, so Bob needs to be assertive and show that he's willing to walk away if he doesn't get a good deal. 
* **Alternative:**  Bob has the option of buying from John for $12,000. This acts as a safety net, giving him leverage during the negotiation.

If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can buy from John in the next round."
