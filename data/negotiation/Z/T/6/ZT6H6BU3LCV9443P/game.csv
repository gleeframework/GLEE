"Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,200,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which would be a fair compromise. This offer considers your position and allows for a successful transaction.  Let's work together to find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
