"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable cost compared to its market value of $150. I hope you find this offer appealing and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $80 from John, which is significantly cheaper than Alice's $120 offer."
