Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at a starting price of $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't commit to such a high price. Would it be possible for you to consider $17,000 as a fair price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18,500?"", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we discuss a price closer to $16,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and it's better to secure a $16,500 deal than risk him walking away and getting only $15,000 from John.
