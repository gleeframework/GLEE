"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $119 is close to your limit, you can try to get a better price. You're willing to buy from John for $120, so rejecting this offer might push Alice to lower her price."
