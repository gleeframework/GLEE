"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$5,000 is a good price**, but you want to see if you can get it for even less.  
* You have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice, so there's time to try and lower the price. 
* **Buying from John for $10,000 is a fallback option**, but you're aiming to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  A $1,000 reduction shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  You're not aiming for a deal at the absolute lowest price right away, but rather to see how Alice responds. 
* **Still within your budget:**  $4,000 is well within your $10,000 limit, giving you flexibility if Alice needs to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing willingness to negotiate:** Her counteroffer is closer to your initial offer. 
* **You want to push for a lower price:** You still have 7 rounds left to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option:** You're not desperate, and you have time to see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Alice halfway:** This shows you are willing to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Moderate increase:**  $4,250 is a reasonable increase from your previous offer.
* **Still a significant saving:**  You're aiming to get the product for less than your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is becoming less flexible:** Her counteroffer is only $100 lower than her previous offer. 
* **You're getting a good deal:** $4,600 is still a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** You only have 5 rounds left, and further negotiation might risk Alice deciding to walk away or John raising his price. 

It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
