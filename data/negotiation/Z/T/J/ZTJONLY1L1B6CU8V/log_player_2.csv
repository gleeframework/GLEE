Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay a little more than my absolute maximum, but $13,000 is still pushing it. I'll try one more counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm confident that the product is worth this price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

Alice has come down a bit, but $12,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and save some money."
