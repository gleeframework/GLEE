,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget at $90. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I see that you're really interested in the product. Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to come down to $89. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",89.0,Alice,5,
