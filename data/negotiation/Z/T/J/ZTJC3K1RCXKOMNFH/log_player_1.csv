Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, giving you a solid profit margin.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It shows confidence:**  Starting high demonstrates that you believe in the value of your product.

**Remember:**  This is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate, counteroffer, and potentially walk away if Bob doesn't meet your expectations. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is still a good amount of money, it's not the best possible outcome.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.  The next offer should be closer to your desired range, and you can always walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900,000. This would still be a great deal for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:** By staying above $850,000, you demonstrate that you're serious about getting a good price. 
* **Show flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, you're showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:** This offer encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and hopefully agree on a price that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Can we try $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's wise to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your minimum:** $875,000 is only $75,000 below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions from your side, potentially lowering the price even further.
* **Time is a factor:**  Every round of negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting this offer allows you to move on and secure a good profit. 

While you might prefer a higher price, it's important to consider the potential risks and benefits of continuing to negotiate. In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice."
