,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is tempting, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $8,250. How about we meet at $7,800? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,800 just doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference again. How about $8,000?  I'm willing to meet you there to make this deal happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $7,900? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my limits.",7900.0,Bob,6,
