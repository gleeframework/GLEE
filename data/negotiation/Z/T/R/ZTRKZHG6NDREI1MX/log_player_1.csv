I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this price will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but it also still leaves me with a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my initial counteroffer. While I'd love to get closer to my target price, accepting this offer is still a good deal. It's a fair compromise and a significant profit for me.  I'm not willing to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
