Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 tempts Bob with a price slightly above his perceived value while still leaving you a profit margin above your minimum.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is friendly and highlights the ""special price"" to entice Bob. 
 
This approach aims to secure the best possible outcome for you."
