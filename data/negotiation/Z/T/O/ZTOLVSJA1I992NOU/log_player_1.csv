Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly.  I'm asking for $1,600,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it implies significant value and confidently assumes Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The open-ended question at the end invites Bob to counter-offer, leaving room for negotiation if he finds the initial price too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  You don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only the product's objective value to him.  A very high offer could make him lose interest entirely. 
* **Alternative Tactics:** You could employ other negotiation tactics like a more gradual approach, emphasizing the product's unique benefits, or creating a sense of urgency."
