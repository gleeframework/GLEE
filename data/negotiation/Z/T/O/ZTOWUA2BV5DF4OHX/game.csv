"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
