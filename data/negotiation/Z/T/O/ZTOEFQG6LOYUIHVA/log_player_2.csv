"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that, hoping to find a middle ground. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and if Alice is motivated to sell, she might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than her initial offer.  Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  While buying from John is always an option, it's still more expensive than what Alice is offering. Continuing to negotiate gives Bob a chance to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still significantly below Alice's current offer.  This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is determined to get a good price.  Hopefully, this will lead to a more agreeable price point for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Even though the rounds are decreasing, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Buying from John is still the most expensive option. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a price closer to Bob's ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing willingness to compromise.  He's still well below Alice's current offer, but approaching a point where it might be more appealing to her than her current price. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about getting a deal, but still wants to save as much as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has lowered her offer again, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  There's still a chance for further negotiation, and Bob is determined to get the best deal possible.  While buying from John is an option, it's still more expensive than Alice's current offer.  There's still value in continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer once more, showing a continued willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is significantly closer to Alice's current price.  It's a considerable increase from his previous offer, and if Alice wants to sell, she may be more inclined to accept it. With only a few rounds left, Bob is getting closer to a deal while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price point, there's still room for negotiation. Buying from John is only $1,000 more expensive, so Bob can afford to be more aggressive in this last round.  A counteroffer could potentially get the price down further and still save money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to secure a deal with Alice.  He's increasing his offer to $13,000, which is still below Alice's current price of $14,000.  This offer demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise, but also leaves room for Alice to make a slight concession if she wants to close the deal.  This counteroffer is a strategic gamble:  if Alice accepts, Bob saves $2,000 compared to buying from John. If she rejects, Bob has to buy from John, which is a less desirable outcome but still within his budget."
