Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, Bob. In order to ensure a fair transaction, I would like to propose a price of $8,340 for the product. This proposal aims to provide a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but she's also holding firm on getting a price above $8,300. The difference between her offer of $8,340 and your desired price is getting quite small, and continuing to negotiate might not yield significant savings. It's better to secure the deal at a reasonable price rather than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John's full price."
