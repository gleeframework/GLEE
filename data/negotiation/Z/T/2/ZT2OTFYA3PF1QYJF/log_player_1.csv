"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit.  I'm also framing it positively, highlighting the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly below what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $8,500 is my lowest price. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I appreciate you coming down. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to accept less than $8,000. I will counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my minimum price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to budge a bit more. Would $8,000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if he'll continue to increase his offer. Rather than risk another round of negotiation with an uncertain outcome, I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
