Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer and offer $1,200,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit short of my target.
