Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $220 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $50 for the product. Would that work for you?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $80? That's the absolute most I can offer.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is already offering.  Cutting my losses now and selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
