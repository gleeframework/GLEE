"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. Please consider my offer carefully. If you choose not to accept, I have another buyer who is willing to pay full price, so I am confident in this deal.
