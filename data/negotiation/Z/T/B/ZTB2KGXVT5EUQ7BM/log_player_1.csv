Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear starting point and demonstrates that you're serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. It's becoming clear that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired value for the product and avoids further negotiations."
