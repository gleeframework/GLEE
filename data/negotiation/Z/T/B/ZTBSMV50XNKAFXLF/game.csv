"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below my minimum. To move this forward, I can come down to $925,000. This reflects the true value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $925,000 is still a tough sell for me.  Could we potentially meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle this right now. How about $850,000?  It's a very strong offer considering the value this product brings.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and land on $810,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",810000.0,Bob,6,
