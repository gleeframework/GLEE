Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below my minimum. To move this forward, I can come down to $925,000. This reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $925,000 is still a tough sell for me.  Could we potentially meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

We're getting closer, but we can still try to push for a bit more before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and land on $810,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000

Bob is very close to our fallback option with John. Accepting the $810,000 offer makes the most sense now to avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
