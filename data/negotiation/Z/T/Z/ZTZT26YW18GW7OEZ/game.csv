"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe this product would be a great addition to my collection, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it would bring you even more than $15,000 worth of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
