"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which represents a significant investment for me and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $975,000.  This offer reflects the product's true worth.  I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
