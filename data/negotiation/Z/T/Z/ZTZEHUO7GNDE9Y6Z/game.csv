"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800000 is a significant amount, it falls short of the value I place on this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $900000. This reflects the unique qualities and potential benefits you'll gain from acquiring it. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still evaluating the value of this product for you, and while I appreciate your offer, it's slightly lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $875000? This would be a fair price considering its value and your potential for a return on investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $875000. I'm willing to go up to $860000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",860000.0,Bob,6,
