"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12000? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11000? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good value for this product. ",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without losing too much.",10500.0,Alice,7,
