"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. I am willing to extend this exclusive offer at a price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $950,000 is above your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option:** You can always choose to buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Demonstrates commitment:** It shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but you also have a clear price limit. 
* **Sets the tone for negotiation:** This counteroffer establishes a lower starting point for the negotiation, which could encourage Alice to be more flexible in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your budget constraints, I'd like to present an alternative. How about considering a price of $825,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** $825,000 is closer to your budget, but still above your limit.
* **More negotiation room:**  There are still 7 rounds left, so you can continue to try and get a lower price.
* **John's offer is still a better option:** If you can't get a price lower than $800,000, you can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $780,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:** This offer is only $45,000 higher than your maximum budget, showing you're serious.
* **Fair compromise:**  It's a good middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's last one.
* **Urgency:** By emphasizing ""Let's make a deal"", you're implying a time-sensitive negotiation, potentially pushing Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and would like to offer a compromise. Considering the value of the product and your budget, how about a price of $800,000? This aligns closely with your offer while ensuring a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer meets your budget:**  $800,000 is exactly your maximum limit.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal. 
* **Same price as John:** You can buy the product from Alice for the same price as John, so there's no advantage to going with John.

It's a good deal for you, and there's no point in pushing for a lower price when you've already reached your limit."
