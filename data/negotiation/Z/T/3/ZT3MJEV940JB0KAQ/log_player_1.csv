"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,520,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I had hoped for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,560,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but $1,560,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,480,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While a higher price would be ideal, Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher than $1,480,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above John's offer, and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
