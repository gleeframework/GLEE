"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can still try to save more money.  Since Bob's maximum price is $15,000, he should reject the offer and try to get a better deal from Alice.  There's a chance Alice will be willing to lower the price to get a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to my original asking price. Would you consider $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and is a good deal.  It's closer to Alice's desired price, making it more likely she'll accept.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a longer process and potentially a higher price if Alice rejects further counteroffers.  It's better to take this offer and avoid the risk of ending up paying more."
