Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still significantly less than what John is charging. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500 by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and a good compromise. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

While $10,750 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit more before settling."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10900}
