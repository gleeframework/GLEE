"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still significantly less than what John is charging. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and a good compromise. Let's work together to make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal!",10900.0,Alice,5,
