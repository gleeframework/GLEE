{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $10500 for the product. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my limit, I can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's a better deal and saves me $500."
