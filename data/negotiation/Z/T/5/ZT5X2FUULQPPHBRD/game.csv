"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. While $110 is a bit higher than I hoped for, I still believe it's a reasonable price given the value of the product. However, I would like to suggest $105 as a compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",107.5,Alice,5,
