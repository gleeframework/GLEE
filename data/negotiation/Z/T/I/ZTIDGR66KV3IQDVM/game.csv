"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000, which is still a great deal for the product. It's a unique opportunity that I think you won't find elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However,  $9,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you consider $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $8,200, which is my lowest price for this product. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
