"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,000,000 is still too high.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, but needs to be realistic. He knows Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so he's offering a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  This price is also close to John's offer, so Bob has a backup plan if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get the price even lower.  He's also aware of John's offer as a safety net if things don't work out with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but still maintaining some leverage. Offering $900,000 shows he's willing to compromise, but he's not giving in entirely.  This price is also strategically positioned to potentially encourage Alice to accept, as it's a reasonable midpoint between their previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and Bob is getting closer to his desired price point. Accepting the offer at $925,000 means Bob saves $75,000 compared to John's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the possibility of running out of rounds makes accepting the current offer the most logical choice."
