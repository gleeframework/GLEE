I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,200,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm happy with $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to sell to John and move on."
