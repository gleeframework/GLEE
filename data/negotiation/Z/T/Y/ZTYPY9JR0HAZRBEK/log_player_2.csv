"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. If you're not interested, I've got another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the chance to either negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
