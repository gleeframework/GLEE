Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but I can't go over $12,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is offering the absolute lowest price he's willing to pay. There's room to negotiate, but it's unlikely we'll reach $20,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $20,000 is a significant investment, but the value this product provides is truly worth it.
