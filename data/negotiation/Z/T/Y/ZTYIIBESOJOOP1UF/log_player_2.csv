Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it to you at $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to a counteroffer is the best strategy."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
