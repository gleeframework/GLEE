{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested given the value to him, and this gives us a starting point to discuss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $115? I really think that's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is only $5 below my counteroffer and is very close to my minimum value.  At this point, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
