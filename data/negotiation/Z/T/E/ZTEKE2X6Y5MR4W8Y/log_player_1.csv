Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer gives you a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price. You can counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit from my previous offer. I'd accept $875,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to pay $825,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While a little lower than hoped for, $825,000 is still a decent price and significantly higher than selling to John.  It's better to take the sure thing and close the deal with Bob."
