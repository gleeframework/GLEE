"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering my research and the current market value. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
