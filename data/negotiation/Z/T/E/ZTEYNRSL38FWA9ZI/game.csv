"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we settle at $1,375,000? This would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, and I'm confident you'd find it to be a good investment.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I truly value your interest in this product.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, I need to make a bit more for it to be worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference again and settle at $1,362,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment.",1362500.0,Alice,7,
