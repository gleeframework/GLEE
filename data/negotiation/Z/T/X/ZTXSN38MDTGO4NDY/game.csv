"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind for this product.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle somewhat. How about we consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  However,  the value I place on it is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000  - it's my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
