# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind for this product.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle somewhat. How about we consider $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. You are willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I believe that's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  However,  the value I place on it is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000  - it's my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
