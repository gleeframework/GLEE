I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop it a bit and sell for $13,000. This is a fair price given the quality and value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,500. I hope this is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get even closer to my initial asking price, $12,500 is still a good deal, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get more from him in the next few rounds.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing the deal altogether."
