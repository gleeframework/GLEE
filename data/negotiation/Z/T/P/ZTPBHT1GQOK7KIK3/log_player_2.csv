Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,250,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also still firm on my desire to stay within a reasonable price range.  It's a good tactic to avoid jumping straight to my maximum budget, leaving some room for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I'll continue to negotiate for a lower price, but I'm getting closer to my limit. I'll be more careful with my counteroffers from now on, but for now, I'll reject the offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still below Alice's latest offer. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'm very close to buying from John."
