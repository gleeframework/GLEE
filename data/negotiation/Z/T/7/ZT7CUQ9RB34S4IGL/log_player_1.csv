Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your $8,000 minimum, so you're already securing a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $500 of wiggle room between your offer and Bob's perceived value, which allows for negotiation if he counteroffers.
* **It shows confidence:** By not immediately accepting the $8,000 offer from John, you show Bob that you believe the product is worth more and are not desperate to sell. 

Remember, the negotiation is dynamic!  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating with him, potentially getting closer to your desired price point.  

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than your initial offer. Aim for something like $9,000.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still gives you a great deal considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle again at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $8,000 meets your minimum acceptable price.  While you might be tempted to try and squeeze out a bit more, there's no guarantee that he will budge further.  Accepting this offer secures your minimum profit, and you can always focus on maximizing your profits with future sales."
