"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum of $150, you can likely get a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is worth trying:** You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price, and there's no guarantee John will still have the product if you wait."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While she's lowered the price, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You're trying to save as much money as possible.
* **Further negotiation is possible:**  You have several rounds left and can likely get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really committed to getting this product, but I can't go above $105.  Is there any wiggle room on your end?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:** $108 is only $3 more than your last offer of $105, and getting a deal is important.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you keep rejecting offers, Alice may get frustrated or you might run out of rounds before you can get a better price. 
* **Value is still good:** Even at $108, you're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
