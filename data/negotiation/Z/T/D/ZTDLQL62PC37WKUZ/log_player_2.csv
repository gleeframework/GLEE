Bob should reject the offer.  The product is only worth $8,000 to him, and Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is the lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product from John for $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
