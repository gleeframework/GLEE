"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $10,000.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit over budget at $10,800.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,600?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,700. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",10700.0,Alice,5,
