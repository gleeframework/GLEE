Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a one-time opportunity and I'm confident it will be worth much more than that for you in the long run. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a reasonable starting point, leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Risk:** I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a higher price than John's offer. This is a gamble, hoping Bob values the product enough to pay more. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, I've successfully sold the product for a higher price.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can fall back on John's $10,000 offer, guaranteeing a sale and a decent profit."
