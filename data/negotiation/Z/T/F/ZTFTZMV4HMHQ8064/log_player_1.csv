"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more,  how about $10,500? It's a fair compromise and still allows you a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $10,000, which is a better deal than Bob's current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,200, which is a very fair compromise. This allows you a good profit margin, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10200}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  I've now gone through 6 rounds of negotiation with Bob, and he's unwilling to meet me at a price that's close to my minimum.  I've already lost a significant amount of time and I'm not confident I can get a better price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower price or prolonging the negotiation further."
