"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,200,000. Can you meet me halfway?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're persistent and I appreciate that. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
