"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $900,000? I think that's a fair deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you consider $975,000? That's a significant move on my part, showing I'm serious about making this deal work.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,037,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve a good outcome. Let's make this deal happen.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair outcome.  To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
