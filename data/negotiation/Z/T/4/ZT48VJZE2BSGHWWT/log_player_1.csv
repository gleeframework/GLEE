Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, it's clear the negotiations are going to be incremental.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a significant amount and eliminates further negotiation risk with Bob.  It makes the most financial sense to take the sure thing at this point."
