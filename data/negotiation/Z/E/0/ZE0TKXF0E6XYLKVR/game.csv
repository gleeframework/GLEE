"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but still a little high for me. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to move a little higher to meet you. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move up, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $10,250. I'm thinking of a price of $10,750. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"This is a fair offer Alice, but it's more than I'd like to spend.  My final offer is $10,300.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different seller.",10300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,300 is a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $10,600. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. This is my final offer.",10600.0,Alice,9,
