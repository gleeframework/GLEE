{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has the same potential value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable deal for me. I've also included a friendly message to establish a positive rapport and highlight the potential value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to take on the risk of purchasing it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, but I need to hold firm on getting closer to my target price."

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $925,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to take on the risk and invest in this opportunity, but I need to be comfortable with the price.

Bob's offer of $935,000 is very close to my desired price and represents a significant profit for me. While I would love to push for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of a sale with John at $1,000,000 makes it sensible to accept Bob's offer."
