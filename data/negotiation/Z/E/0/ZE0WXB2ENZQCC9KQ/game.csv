"Bob, I have a very unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has the same potential value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to take on the risk of purchasing it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $950,000. This price reflects the value we both recognize in this opportunity.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
