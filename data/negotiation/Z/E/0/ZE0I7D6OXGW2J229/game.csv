"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I understand you see the value in this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
