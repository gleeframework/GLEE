"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's worth significantly more than that to you. Let's make this deal happen!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to the value of the product to both parties. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $1,100,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  However, $1,075,000 is still too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,087,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're getting closer. I'd like to counter with $1,080,000 for the product. This seems like a reasonable compromise between our positions.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
