"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  $9,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,750. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than my target price. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,625? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",8625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,800. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,775. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once more.",8775.0,Alice,5,
