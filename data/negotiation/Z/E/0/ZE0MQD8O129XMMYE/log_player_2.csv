"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  $9,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,750. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, there's still some room for negotiation. I'll try to counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than my target price. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,625? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,800. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,775. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,775. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,775
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,775 is very close to my target price of $8,500. While I'd prefer to get it lower, there's a good chance I won't be able to negotiate further.  It's better to secure the product for a slightly higher price than risk losing it and having to buy from John at $10,000."
