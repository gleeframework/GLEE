"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that starting price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product to you is significant, and $900,000 is simply too low.  To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,025,000. This offer reflects its true worth while leaving room for a beneficial deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under a million.  How about $960,000?",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price point under a million, but I need to be fair to the value of what I'm offering. Let's settle this now - $990,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for what you're getting.",990000.0,Alice,5,
