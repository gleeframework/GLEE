"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $10,500. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
