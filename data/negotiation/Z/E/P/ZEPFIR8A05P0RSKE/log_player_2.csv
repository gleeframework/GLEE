"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's only fair to propose a price of $1300000 for this valuable item. This offer is exclusive to you and comes with a special bonus package included. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than her value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting her offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the bonus package, but I'm looking to come in a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, while still leaving a profit margin for her. It's a strong opening counteroffer, but also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice isn't immediately receptive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I would like to propose a price of $1250000 for the product. This includes all the benefits you're interested in, plus an additional customization option that I think would be of great value to you. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still higher than her value of $1,200,000, indicating there is still room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows us to continue pushing for a lower price, aiming to close the deal below our maximum budget of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant improvement over our previous one,  but still offers Alice a profit.  By emphasizing the fairness of this price and our budget constraints, we aim to encourage Alice to accept and finalize the deal."
