"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.  This price is still significantly below what I could get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
