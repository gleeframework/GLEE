Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your current budget, I believe the true value of this product justifies a higher price. I would like to counter your offer with $700,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's actual value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility. To move forward, I propose a price of $690,000. It's a step closer to your offer but still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $690,000, which is only $20,000 higher than Bob's last offer.  Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or the negotiations will drag on.  Since Bob's goal is to save money and he has a backup option with John, accepting the offer at $690,000 is a reasonable choice."
