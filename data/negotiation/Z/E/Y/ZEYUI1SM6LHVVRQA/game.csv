"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product. However, given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'm only able to offer $650,000 at this time.  Let me know your thoughts.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your current budget, I believe the true value of this product justifies a higher price. I would like to counter your offer with $700,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's actual value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than my current budget allows. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $675,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility. To move forward, I propose a price of $690,000. It's a step closer to your offer but still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable.",690000.0,Alice,5,
