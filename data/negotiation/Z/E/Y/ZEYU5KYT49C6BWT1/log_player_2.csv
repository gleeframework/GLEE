Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid I need to make a bit more profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While $1,050,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired budget. He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for both parties to come to a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, which is $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his ideal price, $1,000,000 is still above his budget.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further, especially since she's already lowered her price significantly."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has made concessions and is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $1,012,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a price that Bob can afford, and he has a reliable alternative with John."
