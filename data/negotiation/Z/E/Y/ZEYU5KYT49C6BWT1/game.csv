"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the lower price, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, considering my maximum budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid I need to make a bit more profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal and allows both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, which is $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still slightly more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $975,000. This is a small compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.  I'm hoping we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,012,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
