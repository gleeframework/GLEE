Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,300,000.  This is too high, and Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try to get a lower price, but keep John as a backup option."
