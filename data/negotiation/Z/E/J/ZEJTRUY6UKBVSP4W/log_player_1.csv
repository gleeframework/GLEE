{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:**  I highlight the potential value of the product to Bob, suggesting he would be getting a good deal at this price.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I use the phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" to signal that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while keeping my options open."
