"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product higher. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better. While $1,200,000 is a good deal, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still holding out for a price closer to my desired range. This counteroffer should encourage Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  It's higher than what John is offering, and it's likely we won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
