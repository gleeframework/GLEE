Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this. How about $1,075,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

We still have room to negotiate and Bob is clearly interested. We're aiming for the best possible deal."
