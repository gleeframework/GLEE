"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this. How about $1,075,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, splitting the difference is a fair approach.  However, to make it worthwhile on my end, I'd need to settle at $1,090,000.  This offer reflects my final position.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
