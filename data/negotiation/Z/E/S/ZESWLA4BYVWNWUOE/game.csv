"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to buy it for $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $137.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  Let's try to reach a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still below what I need to get. How about we meet in the middle again, at $126.25? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",126.25,Alice,5,
