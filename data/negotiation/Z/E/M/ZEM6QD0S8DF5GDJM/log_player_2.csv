"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $135. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  It's worth rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:** $130 is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $150 than Alice's previous offer of $135.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice getting frustrated and refusing to sell altogether. 
* **John's offer:** While John offers a guaranteed price, it's higher than Alice's current offer. 

It's a good strategy for Bob to accept Alice's offer, as he's saving $20 compared to John's price and getting a fair deal."
