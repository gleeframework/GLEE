"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,800. Let's try to find a middle ground here. ",13800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500 again, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,700, but I can't go lower. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. ",13700.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $13,700 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,600. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",13600.0,Bob,6,
