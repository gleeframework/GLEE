Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Alice is almost there, but I know I can get it for $120 from John. One more counter offer should do it."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close! I can do $115, and that's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to her price, indicating I'm serious about buying.
* **Sets a Firm Boundary:** By stating ""final offer,"" I'm signaling that I won't go any higher.
* **Still Leaves Room for Profit:** Alice is still making some profit, which might be enough to close the deal. 

If Alice rejects this, I'll buy from John at $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'll meet you at $120, which is my minimum price. If you're really interested, this is my last offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice finally came down to her lowest price, which matches John's price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation."
