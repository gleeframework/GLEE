Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 9500?**  This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but still lower than the price you'd get from John. 
* **The Logic:**  There's a chance Bob might accept, giving you a higher profit than selling to John.  If he rejects, you're still guaranteed to sell to John for your minimum value.
* **Risk vs Reward:** This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for higher earnings."
