Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is designed to maximize my potential profit while still leaving some room for negotiation with Bob. Here's why:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I value the product at $1,000,000, so anything below that is not a good deal for me.
* **Bob's maximum value:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,000,000, which gives me some leverage.

By offering $950,000, I'm:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might be willing to go a bit higher than his initial value.
* **Maximizing potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I make a good profit.
* **Protecting my downside:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and get my desired price. 

This approach balances the need to make a good profit with the risk of losing the deal."
