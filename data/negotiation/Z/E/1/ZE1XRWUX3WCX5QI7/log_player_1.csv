"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's good for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than what I initially offered, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price of $105, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. This should be attractive enough for Bob to consider, especially as he's already shown interest by making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John. Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than risk a further drop in price from Bob."
