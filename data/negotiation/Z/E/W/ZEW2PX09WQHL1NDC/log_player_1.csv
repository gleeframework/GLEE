{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and offers you a significant return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Securing the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of him accepting, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
