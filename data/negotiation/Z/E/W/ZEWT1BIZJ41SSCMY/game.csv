"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $130.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $155? This would still be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a deal, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for around $140. Let me know if you're willing to come down a little bit.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $140 is definitely closer, but I'm still a bit too high at that price. Would you be willing to come up to $145? It's a small step closer to your target, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $142? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to make this happen.",142.0,Bob,6,
