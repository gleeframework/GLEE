"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a reasonable compromise, and I'm ready to make the deal at that price.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as high as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
