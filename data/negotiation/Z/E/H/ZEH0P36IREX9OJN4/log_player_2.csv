"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than her product's value to her ($8,000). There's a lot of room for negotiation. It makes sense to reject this initial offer and propose a counteroffer that's more beneficial to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Alice's offer:** It's always good to maintain a positive tone in negotiations.
* **Expresses interest but at a lower price:** This shows you're serious about buying but want a better deal.
* **Offers a significant but not unrealistic reduction:** A $3,000 drop is substantial but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate. 
* **Provides a reason for the counteroffer:** By mentioning your budget, you give Alice a reason to consider your proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Alice is negotiating, but we can still aim for a better price.  She's moved $1,500, indicating there's room for further compromise. Let's see if we can get closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a reasonable compromise, and I'm ready to make the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Positive Tone:** We continue to be appreciative of Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is directly in between the last two offers, signaling a strong desire to find a compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying you're ""ready to make the deal,"" you imply this is a firm offer, potentially motivating Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as high as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to signal this is her final offer. While we could try to push further, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice will walk away. Accepting $10,200 gets us a decent deal and avoids the risk of paying John's higher price."
