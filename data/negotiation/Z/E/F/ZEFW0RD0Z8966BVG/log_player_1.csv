Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but it's not so high that he'll immediately reject it.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a round number:** This makes the offer seem more concrete and professional.

Remember, the key is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still being attractive to Bob. Be prepared to negotiate and make counteroffers if needed, but don't be afraid to walk away if you don't feel like you're getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like to earn.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  It allows you to acquire the product for less than my asking price and still gives me a profit that's closer to what I need. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,225,000 for the product. This price still allows me to save some money compared to your original asking price and provides a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still significantly less than what you could get from John.  Since your goal is to maximize profit, selling to John at $1,500,000 is the best decision in this situation. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a lower price."
