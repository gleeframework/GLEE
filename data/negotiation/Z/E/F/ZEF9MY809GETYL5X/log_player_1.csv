Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $10,000, so $14,000 is a strong starting position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows it's worth $15,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more, leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting too low, which could make you seem desperate and lead to a lower final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the initial offer of $14,000 and leaves room for further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, you can attempt to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Compromise:**  It's a middle ground between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.
* **Maintain a high value:**  $13,250 is still significantly above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you get a good price.
* **Show flexibility:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It's not a drastic concession, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750.
