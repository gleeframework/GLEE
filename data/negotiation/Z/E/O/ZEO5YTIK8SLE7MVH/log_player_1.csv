Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is significantly less than the value to Bob ($1,500,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and counteroffers.
* I'll be aware of the 10-round limit and the possibility of selling to John for $800,000. 
* My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum value as possible without risking him walking away or needing to accept John's offer."
