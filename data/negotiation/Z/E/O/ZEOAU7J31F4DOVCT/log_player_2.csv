"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $100 is cheaper than John's $80, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high, and we know we can get it for less. It's time to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
 ""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay as little as possible, so we start with a significantly lower offer than $100. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite & Direct:**  We want to keep the tone positive and respectful while clearly stating our desired price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will gauge Alice's flexibility and help us understand how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However, $85 is still more expensive than John's offer of $80. We need to push Alice a bit further down or take John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $75? That's the most I can offer."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're moving closer to a potential agreement by suggesting a price between her $85 and our previous $65.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message conveys that we're willing to negotiate but also have a limit in mind.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $75 puts us in a strong position.  It's a reasonable compromise, and Alice might be more willing to accept since it's significantly closer to her desired price than John's $80 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $80? This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $80, which matches John's offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation since we can't get a better price elsewhere.  We've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
