"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, so it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal."
