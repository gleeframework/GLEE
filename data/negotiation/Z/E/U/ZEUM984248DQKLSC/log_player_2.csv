"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is close to our limit, but there's still room for saving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay as little as possible, so starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($110) creates room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while explaining our budget constraints. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $130 is better than the initial offer, it's still above our ideal price. Alice moving from $140 to $130 indicates she's open to negotiation.
* **Approaching Our Limit:** We don't want to drag the negotiation on for too long and risk Alice losing interest. We'll make one more counteroffer closer to our limit to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $120? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is at our absolute limit and matches Alice's value for the product.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating this is the highest we can go, we're signaling to Alice that this is our final offer and encouraging a decision.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer as it allows her to sell the product at her desired price."
