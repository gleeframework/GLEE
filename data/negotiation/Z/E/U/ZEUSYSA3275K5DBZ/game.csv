"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, and I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the unique features and potential of this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
