"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). I'll also use a positive and encouraging tone to incentivize Bob to accept.  We have 10 rounds, so I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $10,000, I'm confident I can get more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap. I'm not desperate, and I know John is waiting in the wings with a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves me some room to negotiate. I'm aiming to find a middle ground and keep the deal moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a firm budget. How about $12,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I believe there's more room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  John is always an option, but I'm going to keep trying with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise that gets closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me a significant profit.  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to emphasize that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on your price, but I have to stick to my budget. How about $12,500? That's a compromise I'm willing to make to get this deal done today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate. I still have four rounds left, so I'm going to keep trying with Bob for now. John is always an option if the negotiation stalls, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about $13,500? This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this today!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  I'm trying to close the gap while still ensuring a decent profit for myself.  I'm emphasizing that this is a fair compromise and that we can close the deal today, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $12,750. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my own budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm at his final offer of $12,750, which is still below my minimum target price of $15,000.  I've already made several concessions, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether.  I'm going to take John's offer of $15,000, which guarantees me my minimum desired profit. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than risk further negotiation and end up with less."
