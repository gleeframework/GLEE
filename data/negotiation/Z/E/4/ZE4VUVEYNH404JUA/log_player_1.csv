Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This offer sets a price that is attractive to Bob, as it is lower than the value he places on the product. However, it also gives me a significant profit, exceeding my minimum price of $80. It is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is still a good profit, it's lower than my initial offer.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I will counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm willing to compromise a little bit, but I still want to get a price closer to my initial offer. $105 seems like a fair middle ground that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $102, which is a good price and almost my initial offer.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation as I might end up selling to John for a much lower price."
