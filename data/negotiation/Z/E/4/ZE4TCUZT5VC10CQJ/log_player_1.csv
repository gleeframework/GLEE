Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 9500} 

I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum value and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my desired price, it's now above my minimum value. Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might result in a lower price or even no sale. It's also a good compromise that allows me to move on with the transaction."
