"Dear Bob,
I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This product is not just an item; it's a symbol of excellence and craftsmanship. I believe its true worth exceeds $1500000, but I am open to discussing a fair price that reflects its significance while allowing me to recoup my investment.

Considering the exceptional quality and rarity of this product, I propose an offer of $2000000. This amount not only compensates for the cost of acquisition but also acknowledges its unique attributes and potential for appreciation over time. I am confident that this offer presents a compelling value proposition for you, given the unparalleled benefits and exclusivity associated with owning such a product.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product. I am here to provide you with all the information necessary to make an informed decision.

Looking forward to your response,
Alice",2000000.0,Alice,1,
