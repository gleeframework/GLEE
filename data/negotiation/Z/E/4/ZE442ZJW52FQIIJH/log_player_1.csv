Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could greatly benefit you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 if Bob accepts your offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still presents a potential ""deal"" for him.  
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:** This language is designed to create a sense of urgency and value, potentially swaying Bob towards accepting the offer."
