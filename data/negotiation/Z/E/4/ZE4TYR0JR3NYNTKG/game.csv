"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still leaves room for a profit for you, while ensuring I can meet my own needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
