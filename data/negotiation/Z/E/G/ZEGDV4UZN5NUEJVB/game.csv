"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000? That's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get closer to my target price.  Let's split the difference again and go with $1,175,000. This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a profit.  What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
