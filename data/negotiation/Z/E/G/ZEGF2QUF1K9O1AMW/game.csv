"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value it holds for me and provides a fair profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
