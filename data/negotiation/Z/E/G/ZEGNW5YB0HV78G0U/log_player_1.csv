{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $12,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000, leaving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:**  This offer shows that you're serious about selling, but you're also not giving away the farm.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little further."
