Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this item that I think you'd really find valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $19,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to see if you can get a better deal. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $19,000 represents a significant markup from your minimum acceptable price but isn't so high that it's likely to scare Bob away immediately. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Highlighting:**  The message focuses on the value to Bob, potentially making him more willing to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always go down, but you can't go up from your initial offer."
