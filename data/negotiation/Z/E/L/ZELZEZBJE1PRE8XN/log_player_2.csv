"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.

* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a lower price.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to formulate a counteroffer that Alice might be willing to accept."
