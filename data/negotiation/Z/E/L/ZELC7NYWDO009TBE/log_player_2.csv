**Explanation:**

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but it seems like Alice is not willing to go much lower.  At this point,  $990,000 is a decent price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000.  It's still a saving of $210,000 compared to buying from John. Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $990,000."
