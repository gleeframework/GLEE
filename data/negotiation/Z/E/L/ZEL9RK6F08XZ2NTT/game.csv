"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $10,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. While $8,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $7,750? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to walk away happy.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
