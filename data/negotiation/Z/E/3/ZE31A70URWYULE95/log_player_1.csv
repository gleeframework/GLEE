"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John if I decide to sell to him.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,520,000? That's still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,520,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's also above the guaranteed $1,500,000 I can get from John.  There's a good chance that further negotiation won't get me a much better price, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
