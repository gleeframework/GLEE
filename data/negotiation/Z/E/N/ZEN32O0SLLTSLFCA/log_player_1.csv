Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is still below my minimum of $100, and I have 8 rounds left to see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great price for a product that's worth a lot more.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I still have 6 rounds to try and get a price closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for a product that's worth more.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob has shown a pattern of only offering amounts below my minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll come up to my minimum.  Selling to John at $100 is the best option at this point."
