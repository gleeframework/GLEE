{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win situation.  I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. It's not a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that he is willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I believe my offer of $1,200,000 was more than fair.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While he has increased his offer, it's not yet a fair price considering the value of the product. I will counteroffer again and try to reach a mutually acceptable price."
