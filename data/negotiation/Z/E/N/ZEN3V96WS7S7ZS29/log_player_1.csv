Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable margin:**  $1,250,000 is a good starting point, leaving a significant margin for potential counteroffers while still being well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to discussion:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price. 
* **Plan B:**  I am aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and doesn't even come close to my initial offer of $1,250,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can likely negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always fall back on John's offer if I'm unable to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Fairness:**  $1,000,000 represents a fair value for both of us, considering Bob's estimated worth and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm keeping the message positive and focused on finding a solution that works for both parties.
* **John's offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer, providing a safety net if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
