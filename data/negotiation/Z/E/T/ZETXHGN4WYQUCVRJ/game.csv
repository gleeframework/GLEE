"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the product's worth to me.  I'm confident this offer represents a reasonable compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
