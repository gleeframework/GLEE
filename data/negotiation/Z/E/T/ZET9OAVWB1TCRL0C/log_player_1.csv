Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($80), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential ""good deal"" for Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm open to negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If it gets too low, I'll switch to John, securing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price ($100).  It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking a lower price or having to sell to John.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiations."
