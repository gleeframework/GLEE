Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. If he rejects, I'll see how high he's willing to go, but I'll always have John as a backup at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $135. It's still a decent profit for me and shows a willingness to compromise, while also leaving room for further negotiation.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. He's stuck at $120, and while it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $100.  I'm willing to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
