"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? That's a significant discount from my initial asking price and still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500, which would be $11,750. Would you be willing to accept that price?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,750 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,125? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",12125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $12,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the price I was initially considering buying the product from John for. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
