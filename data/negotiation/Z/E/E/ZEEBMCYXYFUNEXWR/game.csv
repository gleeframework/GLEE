"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're motivated to sell, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, which would be $14,500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
