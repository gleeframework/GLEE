Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below $12,000 might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By stating ""this opportunity,"" Alice subtly implies the product might not be available indefinitely, encouraging Bob to act.

**Important Note:** While this offer has a high chance of being rejected, it's the most strategically sound opening move for Alice. If Bob rejects it, she loses nothing and can proceed with John."
