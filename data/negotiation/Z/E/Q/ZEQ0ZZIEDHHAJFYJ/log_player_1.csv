"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value ($120) while still being above my minimum ($80). 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. I'm also stating my perceived value for the product (although it's slightly inflated) to make it clear I'm not giving it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $95, which is closer to my ideal price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the potential benefits for both of us. I'm also reiterating the value of the product and stressing the importance of finalizing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $95. I can do $92, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is a decent price, it's still below my preferred price point. I'm willing to push a little further to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want to stay at $92, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I can accept $93.50. This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 93.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $93.50, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the idea of a compromise and a mutually beneficial outcome.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting a final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $93.50 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $91, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $91 is a bit lower than my preferred price, it's still a significant profit compared to selling to John. With only 4 rounds left, it's better to secure the sale now rather than risk further negotiation and possibly losing Bob as a buyer.  The risk of going through more rounds is not worth the potential gain of a few extra dollars."
