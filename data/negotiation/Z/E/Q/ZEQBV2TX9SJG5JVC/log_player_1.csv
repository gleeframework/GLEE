{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value to you, I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, so I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value our potential partnership, I can't go as low as $1,500,000.  Let's meet in the middle.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1625000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's a good compromise and allows me to close the deal quickly.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I might not be able to secure a better offer within the remaining rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and gets me closer to my desired profit."
