``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and my belief that it's worth more to Bob than the asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $15,000. I want to see if I can get a better deal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a better price, but $13,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop to $15,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a slightly higher price, I'm concerned that the negotiation is dragging on and I might not be able to get a better offer from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum acceptable price."
