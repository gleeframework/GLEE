Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to you is significant, and I can't go below $17,000. It's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and call it $14,500? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,500, and that's still significantly more than John's $8,000 offer.  You've done well negotiating, but accepting John's deal ensures you stay within budget."
