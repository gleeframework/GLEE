"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target price.  Let's try $1,350,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your latest offer. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,325,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, which is closer to my original target. Can we compromise on that price?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
