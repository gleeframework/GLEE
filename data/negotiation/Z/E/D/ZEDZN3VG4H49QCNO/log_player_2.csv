"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product you might be interested in. It's something I know you've been looking for, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price. How does $110 sound? It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
