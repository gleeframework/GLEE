Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This would represent a significant discount for you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $12,000 is a fair price given the product's value. I'm not willing to go above that amount. If you can meet me there, we can close the deal. Thank you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firmly set at $12,000.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
