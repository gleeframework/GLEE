"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is still too high. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within your budget and represents a significant price drop from her initial offer.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars through continued negotiation, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John for $120 outweighs the potential savings."
