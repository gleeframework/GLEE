Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  I'm also confident that I can get at least $80 from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than my desired profit margin.  I will reject his offer and attempt to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a compromise price of $105. This is still a good deal for me, and it might be enough to entice Bob to accept, avoiding further negotiation."
