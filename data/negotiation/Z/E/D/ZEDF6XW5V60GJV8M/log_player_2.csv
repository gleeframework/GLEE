"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to get the product for as low as possible, and Alice's initial offer of $90 is higher than your target price of $100.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $87.50 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87.50 is still a bit higher than your ideal price, but it's within your budget and closer to your target.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting now ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
