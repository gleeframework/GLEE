"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
