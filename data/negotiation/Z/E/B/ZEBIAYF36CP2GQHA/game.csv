"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original offer. How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great product at a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
