"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but that's still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I have to make a living on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to offer $950,000. This represents a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close this transaction efficiently. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. That's my final offer on this product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
