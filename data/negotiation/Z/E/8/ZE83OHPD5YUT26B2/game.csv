"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can agree on this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
