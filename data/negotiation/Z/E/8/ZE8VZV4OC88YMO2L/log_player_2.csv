(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  You have a strong alternative with John, so there's no need to settle for a price this high. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure the product within your budget."
