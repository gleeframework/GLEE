"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  My initial price is $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and slightly above what the product is worth to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate to show good faith and encourage Bob to counter.
* **Building Rapport:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to try and establish a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price ($150). Accepting it ensures I get my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a deal falling through. While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away isn't worth it at this point."
