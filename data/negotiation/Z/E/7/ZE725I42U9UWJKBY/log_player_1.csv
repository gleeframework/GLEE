**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very reluctant to approach the product's true value to me.  At this point, the potential profit from continuing to haggle with Bob is outweighed by the guaranteed sale to John at my desired price. It's time to move on and secure the best possible deal."
