"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Framing the Offer:** I'm trying to make the offer appealing by highlighting the product's value and potential. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,500,000, I leave room for Bob to counter without feeling like I'm immediately cutting him off.

**Remember:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,200,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my starting offer and doesn't reflect the potential value I see in the product.
* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm still early in the negotiation process, and there are more rounds available. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Opportunity to Counter:** Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price that's more in line with my desired outcome. 

**Next Round:** I will counter with a price between Bob's offer and my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your interest, $1,300,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, considering the product's potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's potential to encourage Bob to see the value in a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I end with a question to keep the conversation open and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1400000, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** While closer to my minimum, $1,350,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation Continues:** We're only four rounds in, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob.
* **Counter Offer is Likely:**  I'll use the next round to counter with a price that's closer to my desired outcome.  I'll likely aim for a compromise between my last offer and Bob's current offer.

**Next Round:** I'll counter with a price between $1,350,000 and $1,400,000, aiming to find a compromise that is fair to both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1,375,000. This reflects both our needs and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finding a Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,350,000).  It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's value, hoping he sees the merit in a slightly higher price.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language like ""compromise"" and ""agreement"" to create a sense of collaboration and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:** 

* **Waiting for Bob's Response:** I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my offer. 
* **Counteroffer Preparation:**  If Bob rejects, I'll need to be prepared with a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price that's slightly higher than $1,375,000 but still lower than my initial offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Consider Backup Option:** If the negotiation stalls, I'll be ready to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  However, I'm still hopeful that I can close a deal with Bob at a higher price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Continues:**  We are nearing the halfway point, and I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet.
* **Counter Offer Strategy:**  I'll counter with a price between $1,325,000 and my last offer of $1,375,000.  This shows flexibility while trying to inch closer to my desired outcome.

**Next Round:**  I'll counter with a price like $1,350,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,325,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $1,350,000.

```

**Explanation:**

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Not Ideal:**  While $1,320,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a satisfactory price. I believe there's still room to push for a slightly higher price. 
* **Negotiation Time is Running Out:** We have two rounds left, so I need to consider the potential risk of reaching a stalemate. However, selling to John at $1,200,000 is not ideal, either. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll counter with a price that's a compromise between my last offer ($1,350,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,320,000).  This shows flexibility while trying to close the deal at a higher price.

**Next Round:**  I'll counter with a price like $1,335,000."

Round 10
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last opportunity to secure a deal with Bob.
* **Close to Minimum:** While $1,320,000 is not ideal, it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of No Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, I'll have to sell to John for $1,200,000, resulting in a lower profit.
* **Securing a Sale:**  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale than to risk ending up with no deal and losing the chance to earn any profit at all.

**Conclusion:**  By accepting Bob's offer in this final round, I am able to secure a sale and earn a profit. While the price is not ideal, it's better than selling to John for a lower price or walking away with no deal at all."
