"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for this product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $13,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $14,500. This is as low as I can go.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $13,750? ",13750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, but that's as close as I can get to $13,750 without losing money on the deal.",14250.0,Alice,9,
