"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low.  Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope it's a good starting point for us to find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $700,000. If you're willing to meet me somewhere near there, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but  $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000, which is a substantial compromise.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",750000.0,Alice,5,
