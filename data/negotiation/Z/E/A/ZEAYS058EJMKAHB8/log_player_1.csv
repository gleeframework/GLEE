``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum while still maintaining a good relationship with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiation,  his offer is too low at this point. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low.  Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope it's a good starting point for us to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $700,000. If you're willing to meet me somewhere near there, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $700,000 is still too low.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
