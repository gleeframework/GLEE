{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my price downwards in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I believe it's a fair price that might be acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low for me. I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John."
