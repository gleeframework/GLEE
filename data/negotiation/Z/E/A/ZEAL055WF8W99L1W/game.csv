"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm!  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, especially since I know the product is worth $10,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer you $9,500 for it, which is still a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a good price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,800 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm going to offer you $10,200.  This is a good price for you considering your value for the product, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's close this deal!",10200.0,Bob,6,
