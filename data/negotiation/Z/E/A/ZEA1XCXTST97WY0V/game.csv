"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. That's the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
