Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for some back-and-forth without immediately reaching my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer for $1,000,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a significant price difference, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his willingness to negotiate. This opens the door for me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while acknowledging his perspective."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** My counter-offer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while staying closer to my desired range.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive.
* **Positive Language:** The tone remains friendly and encourages continued negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to work with Bob, which can increase his likelihood of accepting.

Let's see if Bob is willing to budge!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. That's the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $825,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer keeps Bob as a potential buyer for future transactions.
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation could take time and effort, and I might not be able to secure a significantly better price. 

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $900,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale. The potential for future business with Bob also weighs in favor of accepting."
