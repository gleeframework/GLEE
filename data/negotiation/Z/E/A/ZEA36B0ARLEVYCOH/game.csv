"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and I can't go as low as $1,250,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? I believe this reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,325,000. How about we try $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,280,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,280,000. How about we try $1,240,000?",1240000.0,Bob,6,
