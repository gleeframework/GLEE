"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer, and we're getting closer to my desired price. While I could try for a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $1,250,000 is a good profit for me, and I don't want to push my luck."
