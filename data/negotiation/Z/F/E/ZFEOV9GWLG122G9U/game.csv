"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to reaching your target price, but I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll lower the price to $1,275,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me here, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
