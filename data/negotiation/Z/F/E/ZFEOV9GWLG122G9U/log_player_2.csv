"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to reaching your target price, but I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll lower the price to $1,275,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me here, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** $1,275,000 is significantly less than John's $1,500,000 price and a decent compromise from your target of $1,200,000.
* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks her walking away from the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures the product and avoids potential delays."
