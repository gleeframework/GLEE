,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the introductory price, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? ",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
