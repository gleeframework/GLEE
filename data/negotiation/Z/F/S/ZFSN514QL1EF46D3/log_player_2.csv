"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $450,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $500,000, and I'm willing to get closer to that. However, I'm still not comfortable with $510,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $520,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while it's not ideal, getting the product for $520,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $800,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice walking away, leaving me to purchase from John at a much higher price."
