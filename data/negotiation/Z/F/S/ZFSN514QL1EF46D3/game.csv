"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $600,000 is a little high. Would you consider $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $450,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $550,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $500,000. Would you be willing to settle at $510,000?",510000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $500,000, and I'm willing to get closer to that. However, I'm still not comfortable with $510,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $520,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",520000.0,Alice,5,
