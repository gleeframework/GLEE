"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. Let's make this happen. ",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not getting any younger, and I really need this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
