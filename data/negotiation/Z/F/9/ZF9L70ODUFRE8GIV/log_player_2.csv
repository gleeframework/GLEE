(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's a significant improvement from her previous offer and is well within his budget. There's not much more room to negotiate at this point, and accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids potentially going through more rounds of negotiation or ending up buying from John at a higher price."
