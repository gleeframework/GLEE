"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This leaves a decent amount of room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, knowing he values it at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $11,000 offer.  It's still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit higher and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. There are still several rounds left, and I believe Bob is willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm offering $10,250. This is another compromise, coming down just a bit from my last offer.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while still leaving some room for him to potentially counter-offer if needed."
