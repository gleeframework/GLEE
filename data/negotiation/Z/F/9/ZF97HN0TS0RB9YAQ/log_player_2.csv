"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice's offer is above your maximum, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."

Let's start with the maximum I'm willing to pay. If Alice isn't willing to go that low, I'll go with John's offer."

While $1,200,000 is closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to pay that much.  I'll try one more counteroffer before going with John."

I'm willing to go a little higher, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than $1,200,000."

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,300,000, which is still above my budget. It's time to take the sure thing with John and buy for $1,000,000."
