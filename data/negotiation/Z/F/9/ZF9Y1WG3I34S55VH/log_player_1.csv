{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product description] that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum value. It's also important to give Bob a reason to buy the product and make it clear that you're open to negotiation. This will encourage Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a better price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product description and believe it could be useful. However, I am looking to keep my investment within $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try and get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if we can find a middle ground.  How about $12,500? That would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still making this a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $11500 as the price for the product. This allows us both to reach an agreement that is fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum, but it's also within a range I'm comfortable with.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is only offering $10,000."
