"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Since we have 10 rounds and know the maximum we're willing to pay is $1,200,000, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am not just playing games.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to come down a bit from her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer. While $820,000 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I want to keep the pressure on Alice to see if she's willing to come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway. By offering $780,000, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about getting this deal done, but I'm still aiming for a price that's favorable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I'd still prefer a lower price, $800,000 is a reasonable price given the potential to get a better deal with John. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the product,  as further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
