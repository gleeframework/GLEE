"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I agree the product is good, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
