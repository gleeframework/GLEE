"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little more to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  This seems like a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a little more. How about we settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
