"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also framing it as a ""great deal"" to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product to me, but I would like to propose a price of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $825,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and your desired profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I want to close the deal before we run out of rounds.  $825,000 is a good compromise."
