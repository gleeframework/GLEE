"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize this deal.  I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
