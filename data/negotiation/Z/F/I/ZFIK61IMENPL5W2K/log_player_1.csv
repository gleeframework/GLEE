{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** The price is not my absolute minimum, allowing me to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm using John's offer as a safety net and a way to potentially incentivize Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low yet.
* **I'm using John's offer as leverage.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell and have other options. This can incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **I'm confident that I can get a better price through further negotiation.**  I believe I can convince Bob to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair solution for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** By stating that this price allows us to ""close the deal,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While offering a lower price, I'm still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, so I'm in a strong position.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still push for a higher price.  Bob is clearly interested, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could accept Bob's offer, the risk of getting a better price from him is worth it.  

**Next Move:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly above $1,250,000, aiming for a final deal closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize this deal.  I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:** I'm raising my offer slightly, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Framing as a Final Deal:** By emphasizing that this price will allow us to ""finalize this deal,"" I'm subtly pushing Bob towards making a decision and avoiding further back-and-forth. 
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm reiterating that the price is fair and will benefit both parties, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Continued Leverage:**  My offer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, highlighting that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a price point that Bob is willing to accept, while still maximizing my own profits. By continuing to negotiate strategically, I believe I can reach a deal that satisfies both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unwavering on Price:** Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge much from his initial offer, which is far below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which is significantly better than anything Bob has offered. 
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be unproductive and time-consuming.  I don't want to risk losing out on a much better deal with John.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale with John.  While I would have liked to get a better price from Bob, I cannot afford to wait around for him to change his mind."
