This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $9,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9750}

# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose $9500 as the price for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
