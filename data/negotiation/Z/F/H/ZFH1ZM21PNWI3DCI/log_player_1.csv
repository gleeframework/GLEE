Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a decent starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm curious to see if Bob is interested at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, and I hope it will be appealing enough to him while still leaving some profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,500.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's a reasonable compromise and ensures a sale above my minimum value.  I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John."
