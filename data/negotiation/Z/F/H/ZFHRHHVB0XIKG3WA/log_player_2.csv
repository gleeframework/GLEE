"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. We can try a counteroffer significantly lower than $120 to see how much Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to establish a lower baseline for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's starting point, but still leaves room for us to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're still a bit away from our target price. Let's see if we can push a bit further before potentially accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're moving closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer splits the difference between her previous offer and our last one, showing we're willing to compromise but still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to a decision, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $95. How about we meet at $105? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $105 is a reasonable price, well within our $150 budget. Further haggling might risk losing the deal altogether."
