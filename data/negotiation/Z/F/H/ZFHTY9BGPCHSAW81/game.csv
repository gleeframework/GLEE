"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer. While $9,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both place on the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me. This product is worth significantly more than that, and I've already made a substantial concession.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. If you're truly interested in acquiring this product, I suggest you reconsider. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. I've been very open to negotiating, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. I'm not going to be able to go any higher. If you're not willing to consider this, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still too far below my minimum.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm at a point where I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $10,250.  This reflects the market value and acknowledges your interest in acquiring this unique product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,250 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $9,875.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  I'm confident that this is the best deal we can reach, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",9875.0,Bob,8,
