"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to me reinforces its value and sets a baseline for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I have several rounds left to negotiate, and I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price.  
* **Avoiding a quick sell:** Selling to John now would be the most convenient option, but it's not the most financially beneficial. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer. While $9,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of a deal for both of us, focusing on a ""win-win"" scenario.
* **Continued Negotiation:** I'm still trying to reach a deal with Bob, but I'm also raising the price to get closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both place on the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is being stubborn:** Bob is insistent on his $9,000 offer, even though it's significantly below my minimum.
* **Time is running out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I need to be cautious and not lose too much time with this stalemate.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm still confident I can get a better price, even if it means pushing Bob a bit further.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, but I will be more assertive in getting closer to my desired price. I need to find a balance between being flexible and not giving away too much."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me. This product is worth significantly more than that, and I've already made a substantial concession.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. If you're truly interested in acquiring this product, I suggest you reconsider. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm taking a firmer stance, clearly stating that $9,000 is unacceptable. 
* **Final Offer:** I'm setting a clear deadline by declaring this my ""final offer."" This creates pressure on Bob to act.
* **Threat of Moving On:**  I'm subtly threatening to walk away from the deal, emphasizing the risk of losing the opportunity.
* **Slight Compromise:** I've lowered my price again, but only by a small amount, to show I'm still willing to negotiate but not give in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. I've been very open to negotiating, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. I'm not going to be able to go any higher. If you're not willing to consider this, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't benefit me enough.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm determined to get a price that's closer to my desired value. 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, but I'll need to be more strategic and persuasive to convince him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still too far below my minimum.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm at a point where I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $10,250.  This reflects the market value and acknowledges your interest in acquiring this unique product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise, increasing my offer by $250, but still maintaining a price that's significantly higher than Bob's.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm emphasizing the market value of the product and acknowledging Bob's interest to make him feel valued and appreciated.
* **Finality:** While not declaring it as my ""final"" offer, the language suggests that I'm not willing to go much lower, building pressure on Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, suggesting a win-win scenario for both parties.

This approach aims to subtly push Bob towards a higher price while keeping the negotiation open and friendly. With limited rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between flexibility and assertiveness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,250 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $9,875.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  I'm confident that this is the best deal we can reach, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to two rounds left, and Bob's offer is still well below my minimum.
* **Limited Potential:** While Bob's offer is closer than before, I'm not confident I can push him much further in just two rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly higher than anything Bob is offering.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I need to prioritize my financial goals and secure the best possible outcome for myself. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoid risking further negotiation with Bob."
