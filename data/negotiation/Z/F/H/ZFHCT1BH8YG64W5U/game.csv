"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still higher than my budget. Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $95.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $98.  That's a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $100. I'll meet you halfway between $105 and $98, and sell the product to you for $101.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",101.5,Alice,7,
