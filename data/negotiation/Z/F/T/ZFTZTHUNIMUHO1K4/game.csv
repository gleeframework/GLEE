"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $92. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $88? I'm serious about buying the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $90. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
