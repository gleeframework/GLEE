"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the price is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still lower than your maximum budget and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
