Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $12,000 (your deal with John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 saving compared to his valuation, making it likely he'll accept. This price also earns you a $2,000 profit over your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or willingness to pay closer to his maximum valuation."
