{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little extra."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is better than what he initially offered, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $95 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? This way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to lower your price to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on staying at $95, and while that's a decent price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  John is a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum. I'll sell to John."
