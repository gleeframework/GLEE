Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, potentially even exceeding $1,000,000. To be fair, I'm offering it to you at the price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Emphasis on value to Bob:** By highlighting the product's potential worth to Bob, you're justifying the high price and appealing to his potential gain. 
* **Sense of urgency and scarcity:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by leveraging your strong position while still leaving a possibility for Bob to accept a price that's beneficial to both of you."
