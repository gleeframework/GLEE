Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. I can do $120, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value from this product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $80? That feels like a fair price to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and my previous offer of $120, so I'll counter with $100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to negotiate, her ""final offer"" of $100 is still above your maximum budget of $80. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs, so it makes more sense to buy from him at this point.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds."
