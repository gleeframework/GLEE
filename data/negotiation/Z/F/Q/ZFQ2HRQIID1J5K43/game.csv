"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $13000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $10250. Can we meet at this price?",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm not willing to go lower than that, as it's my minimum price. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11500. Can we make a deal at this price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
