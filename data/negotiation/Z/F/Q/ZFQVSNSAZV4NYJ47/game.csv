"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you really want the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $120? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy it now.",120.0,Bob,4,
