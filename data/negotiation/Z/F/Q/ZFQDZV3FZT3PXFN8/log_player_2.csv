# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
