"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way above my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I can only offer $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above his budget and he has more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still too high, and he's already made his final counteroffer. There's no guarantee Alice will accept it in the next round. It's better to secure the product at a lower price from John rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price."
