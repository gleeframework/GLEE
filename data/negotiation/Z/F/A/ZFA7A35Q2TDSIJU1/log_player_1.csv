"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $120 and leaves some room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it is still less than the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a price that Bob will find acceptable while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $132 is a good compromise and allows me to earn more than selling to John.  The negotiation has progressed well and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to counteroffer."
