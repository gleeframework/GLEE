Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your worth:** The product is worth $10,000 to you, and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. You should aim to get at least that amount.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at your desired price doesn't mean Bob won't try to negotiate.  If he's highly interested, he might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Time is money:**  While Bob considers the offer, you aren't wasting time trying to lowball him and risk losing both potential buyers. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
