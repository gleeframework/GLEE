"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. This product is attractive, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to stand firm at this point. If you're willing to meet me at $850,000, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,7,
