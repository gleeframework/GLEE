"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $10500 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer you the product for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, and I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $10000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9000, and I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price. $9000 is my absolute limit.",9000.0,Bob,8,
