Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, but I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it holds. I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Message:** I've included a friendly message that acknowledges Bob's potential value and emphasizes the fairness of the offer. This helps build a positive rapport and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizes chances of acceptance:** The price is attractive to Bob while still being profitable for me.
* **Secure fallback option:**  John's offer provides a safety net if Bob rejects, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message suggests flexibility, allowing for further discussion if needed."
