,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  This offer stands until the end of the next round.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
