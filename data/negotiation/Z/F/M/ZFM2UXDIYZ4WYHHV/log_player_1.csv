Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum value of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $14,000 is less than Bob's maximum value of $15,000, meaning he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, which could lead to a higher final price for you.

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you have the option to counteroffer or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still less than your initial offer. This means you have room to negotiate. It's best to try and get a higher price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down to $12,500. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,250. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal for you. It's above your minimum of $12,000 and also quite close to your counteroffer of $13,250.  It's best to accept this offer to secure a good profit."
