"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above our minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The language is positive and emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, we invite him to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy seeks to maximize our potential profit while acknowledging Bob's side and keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our absolute minimum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. There's room to maneuver and potentially secure a better deal. We started high, and Bob countered with a more reasonable offer, but one that still leaves a significant gap. By rejecting and countering, we demonstrate our willingness to negotiate but also hold firm on achieving a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your position.  However,  $1,050,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and his constraints while emphasizing our understanding of his perspective.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between our last offer ($1,150,000) and his counteroffer ($1,050,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly remind Bob of the product's value and potential profitability, subtly nudging him towards accepting a higher price.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob within a reasonable timeframe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential.  While I'm eager to acquire it, $1,100,000 remains a stretch for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,075,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, we still have negotiation rounds left and are currently beating John's offer. It's worth seeing if we can push Bob a little further before considering accepting.  The risk of Bob walking away is mitigated by John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I respect your approach. Let's make this happen.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for both of us.  "",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. It's time to apply a bit more pressure and signal that we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Slight Concession:**  We're making a smaller concession this round ($10,000) compared to the previous round ($25,000). This shows that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to seriously consider the proposal rather than continuing to counter back and forth. 
* **Still Above John:**  It's important to remember that even at this price, we're still significantly above John's offer, making it a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  I'm still a bit above my target price. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,080,000. This represents a significant step toward a mutually beneficial agreement. I truly hope we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is clearly motivated and has steadily increased his offer.  $1,080,000 is a strong price, exceeding our minimum and John's offer by a comfortable margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we *might* be able to squeeze out a bit more in the remaining rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases if we push too hard. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Prolonged negotiations can be draining.  Accepting a good offer now allows us to move forward and potentially allocate our time and resources to other opportunities."
