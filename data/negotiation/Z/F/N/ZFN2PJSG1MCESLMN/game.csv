"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your position.  However,  $1,050,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential.  While I'm eager to acquire it, $1,100,000 remains a stretch for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,075,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I respect your approach. Let's make this happen.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for both of us.  ",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  I'm still a bit above my target price. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,080,000. This represents a significant step toward a mutually beneficial agreement. I truly hope we can finalize this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
