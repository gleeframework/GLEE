Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This is a high initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high, as Bob values the product less than you do. This sets the stage for a potential compromise later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. There's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer but is closer to the middle ground. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still below it. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher and meets your minimum price.  It's more advantageous to sell to John at this point."
