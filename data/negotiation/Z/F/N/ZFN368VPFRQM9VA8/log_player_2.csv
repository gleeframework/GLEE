"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a price of $12,000. It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on something that's worth a lot to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,750. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $11,750 is still a good deal for you.  It's lower than what John is selling it for, and it's closer to your desired price point.  Accepting the offer saves you money and avoids further negotiation."
