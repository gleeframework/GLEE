"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product holds for me, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your cost. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $860,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your cost. Let's try to close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $860,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $870,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
