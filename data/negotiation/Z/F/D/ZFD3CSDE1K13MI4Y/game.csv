"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $175. Is that something you'd be interested in?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. While $175 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think it's a little steep. How about $130? That would be a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $155 is close, but I have a strict budget. Would you consider $140? That's the highest I can go.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already gone lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $145, but that's as low as I can go. Is that a deal?",145.0,Alice,7,
