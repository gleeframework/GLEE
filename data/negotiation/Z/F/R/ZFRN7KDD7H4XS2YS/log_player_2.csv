# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your business. I'm confident this price reflects its worth.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to start the negotiation by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,050,000? That leaves some room for negotiation and ensures we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my target price.  Although it's closer to my maximum budget, I still have room for further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer will allow me to continue lowering the price.  If the price drops to my desired range or lower, I can always accept it.  If not, I can always buy the product from John at my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and will allow us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is now at my maximum budget.  This is a good deal for me since it matches my target price.  There's no need to continue negotiating, as I can secure the product at my desired price. It's also a good deal for Alice, as she's getting her minimum asking price."
