"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $13,500.  This product is worth a lot to the right buyer. My final offer is $16,000.  Take it or leave it.",16000.0,Alice,5,
