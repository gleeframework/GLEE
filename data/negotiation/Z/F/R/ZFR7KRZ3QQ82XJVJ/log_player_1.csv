"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a firm position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and potential ""ROI,"" I'm aiming to shift Bob's focus towards the potential benefits rather than solely the initial cost. 
* **Strategic Goal:** This first offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. It allows me to understand how aggressive he is willing to be in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $2,300,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own stated value for the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation. Accepting at this stage would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  I'll counter in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true capabilities and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer takes into account the value it offers but also shows my willingness to find a compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant, but Strategic, Reduction:** While I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, it keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals flexibility but maintains a strong position. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm continuing to reinforce the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits beyond the immediate cost.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The phrasing emphasizes my willingness to find a compromise,  encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,900,000 is still too far from what I have in mind. To be frank, I'm considering other options at this point. If you're able to come down to $1,200,000, I'm ready to make a deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting interesting. Bob's offer is now above his perceived value of the product, indicating a stronger interest than initially implied. However, it's still below my minimum. His mention of ""other options"" might be a negotiation tactic, but it's also a signal that I need to move carefully. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, but I'll need to make a significant concession in the next round to entice him while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to consider a significant price adjustment to close this deal today.  How about we settle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this done, but it's also my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial move by dropping to $1,450,000. This puts the price just below my guaranteed sale to John but significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Urgency and Finality:** By framing it as a ""final offer"" to close the deal ""today,"" I'm adding a sense of urgency, hoping to push Bob towards a decision.
* **Balance:** This offer balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might walk away, forcing me to accept John's offer. However, it also presents a strong chance of securing a significantly higher price than Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we should try and find a solution here. Your final offer is closer, but still above my budget.  I can go up to $1,100,000. If that works, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I appreciate your time, but I'll need to go with a different option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the crucial point. Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than my last, and he's signaled a firm walk-away point. While there are still rounds left, the gap feels too large to bridge without going significantly below my guaranteed offer from John. 

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation carries a high risk of Bob walking away, leaving me to accept the $1,500,000 from John anyway.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is now outweighed by the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 

Therefore, it makes the most strategic sense to cut my losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed price."
