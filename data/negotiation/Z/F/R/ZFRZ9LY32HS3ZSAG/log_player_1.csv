Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price and leaves room for negotiation if needed. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, considering the product is worth $12,000 to him.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but if he accepts, I'll have secured a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $10,500 and avoid further negotiations, I believe I can do better.  I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob, given the product's value to him. 

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to him. I'm hoping he'll accept, as it's closer to his offer than mine, and it would allow us to reach a deal."
