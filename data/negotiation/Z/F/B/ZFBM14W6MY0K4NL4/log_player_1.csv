Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth at least $10,000. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. It also reinforces the product's value in Bob's mind.
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything because I can sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
