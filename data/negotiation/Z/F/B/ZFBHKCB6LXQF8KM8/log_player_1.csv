"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.**  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can potentially negotiate a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to maximize my profit.** I'll only consider selling to John if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not going to get a better deal from Bob. 
* **Selling to John would give me the same amount.**  There's no financial advantage to waiting. 
* **Accepting Bob's offer is the best option.** It ensures a quick and satisfactory deal."
