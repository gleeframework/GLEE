Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the return you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have a fallback option with John, ensuring I won't be forced to accept anything below $1,200,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, encouraging Bob to accept."
