"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer. You can always fall back on buying from John for $150 if needed."
