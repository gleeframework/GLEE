"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider  $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
