"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  My asking price is $180, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but lower than what John would pay. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price. I'm also expressing willingness to negotiate, which might make Bob more likely to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value and would like to propose a price of $150. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I can still try to get a bit more.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $180."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $170?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 170}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to propose a price of $160 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and closer to my desired price of $180. I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
