"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000, a price that gives you a significant return on your investment. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John. While her message uses some sales tactics, the price itself is a good deal."
