Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,500,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the deal.  A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant portion of the profit margin while still leaving Bob with a feeling of getting a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It emphasizes exclusivity and value, subtly reminding Bob that this is a limited opportunity.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 allows you to capture $350,000 of the potential profit margin. This is a 70/30 split in your favor, but it still leaves Bob with a $150,000 gain compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiating style."
