"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value.  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested, but $105 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $101.25. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we try $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100, which is the price you originally mentioned was worth to you.",95.0,Bob,6,
