Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To move this forward, I can offer the product for $1,350,000. This represents a significant concession on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

While I could push for more, accepting $1,300,000 is a solid profit.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation stalling and ending up with John's offer."
