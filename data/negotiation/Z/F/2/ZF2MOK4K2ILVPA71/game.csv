"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $7,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,800. Would that work for you?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, but I need to let you know that I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer on that end.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. My absolute maximum is $7,000.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $7,200, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm not budging on that. I'm starting to think that we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make one final offer: $7,200, and that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",7200.0,Alice,7,
