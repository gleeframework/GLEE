"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $850,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about we agree on $825,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my last offer of $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",750000.0,Bob,6,
