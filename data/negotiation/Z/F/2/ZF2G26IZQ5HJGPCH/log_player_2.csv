You're still closer to your goal of $120 with John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

Round 5

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're very close to your target price with Alice, and it's likely John won't budge on his price. It's better to secure the product for $105 than risk losing it and paying $120 to John."
