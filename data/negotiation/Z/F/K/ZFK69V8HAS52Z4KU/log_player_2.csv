"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a very high initial price, and Bob should definitely reject it.  He has plenty of room to negotiate and can use the threat of buying from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should start by making a strong counteroffer that's close to his maximum budget. This establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation. He knows Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so he's leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's lowered. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. He can still potentially get a better deal from Alice or go with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly to show he is willing to negotiate but still maintain a strong position. This counteroffer is a good middle ground between his maximum budget and Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price. He's still got more rounds to go and the option of buying from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but Alice is still offering a price higher than his comfort zone.  He's increasing his offer again, showing he's willing to compromise but also demonstrating his willingness to walk away if necessary. This counteroffer is a good middle ground, leaving room for Alice to come down while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but Alice's offer is still above his ideal price point. He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get a better deal.  It's worth pushing for a better price, especially since he has the option of buying from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob has reached a point where he needs to consider his options carefully. He can either accept Alice's offer of $1,050,000 or push for a lower price. This offer of $1,000,000 is a good middle ground. It shows he's serious about buying but still willing to negotiate. He has to weigh the risk of Alice rejecting the offer against the potential of getting a better price or losing the deal altogether."
