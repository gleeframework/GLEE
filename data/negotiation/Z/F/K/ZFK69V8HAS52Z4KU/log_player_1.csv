"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This will give me room to negotiate down if needed.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  While I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I'd prefer to get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm serious about selling to him, but also that I won't go lower.  If he rejects this, I can confidently sell to John without losing out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for improvement. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value.  However, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, so I won't be overly aggressive with my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to offer a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, to try to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired value.  I still have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under any pressure to close this deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to my desired value, knowing that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer closer to my desired value. With only a few rounds left, I'm feeling a bit more pressure to close the deal, but I'm still confident I can secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I don't think Bob is going to offer anything higher.  Given that I only have a couple of rounds left and John is guaranteed to buy at $1,200,000, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a good deal and guarantees me a decent profit."
