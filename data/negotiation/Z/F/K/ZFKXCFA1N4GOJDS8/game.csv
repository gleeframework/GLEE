"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds tremendous value.  My initial price is $2000000. This is a fair reflection of its potential and the market value of similar products.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is significantly below my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'd be happy to accept $1750000 for the product.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1350000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1350000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1600000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's potential while also being within your reach. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm thinking $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
