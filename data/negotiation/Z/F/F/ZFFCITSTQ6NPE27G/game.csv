"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,450,000. This is a fair price that allows us to both move forward with the transaction.  I hope you'll reconsider.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,450,000 is close, I'm aiming for a final price of $1,350,000.  This offer reflects the value I place on the product and ensures it aligns with my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
