Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still exceeding my minimum price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and I can still accept a price that's profitable for me.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I know John will buy the product for $150, so I have a guaranteed minimum sale price. This gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
