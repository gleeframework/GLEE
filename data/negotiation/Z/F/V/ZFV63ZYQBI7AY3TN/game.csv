"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest in the product. However, $950000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and the potential for me to acquire it from another seller. I'm confident this price would be mutually beneficial. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you and the potential for you to acquire it from another seller, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $900000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is getting closer to where I'd like to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both our needs.  Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $875000. Considering the product's value to me and the potential for me to sell it to another buyer, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $887500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",887500.0,Alice,5,
