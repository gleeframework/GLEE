"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we meet at $1,120,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1120000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,135,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1135000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $1,115,000? I'm willing to make a small compromise, but I need to get as close to $1,100,000 as possible.",1115000.0,Bob,6,
