# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this one-of-a-kind product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $950,000. I believe this represents a fair price that acknowledges its significant worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, and I'm open to negotiation.  While $850,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this revised price still reflects the true value of the product.
