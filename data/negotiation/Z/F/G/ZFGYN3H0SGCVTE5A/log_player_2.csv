I'm offering $750,000. This is a fair price that leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

I'm offering $825,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, but still leaves some room for both of us to make a profit. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price."
