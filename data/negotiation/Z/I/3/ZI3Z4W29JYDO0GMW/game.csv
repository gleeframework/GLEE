"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $8,000. Considering its true worth to you at $15,000, let's aim for a fair compromise. How about we start at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'd like to suggest a price of $10,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount from the product's true value to you, while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.",10000.0,Alice,5,
