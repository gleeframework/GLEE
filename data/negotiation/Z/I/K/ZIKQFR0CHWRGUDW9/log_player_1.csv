"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product is worth quite a bit less to me than what you're asking. How about we bring the price down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to secure a price that reflects the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I understand this product has a different value to you, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,300,000. This leaves room for both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
