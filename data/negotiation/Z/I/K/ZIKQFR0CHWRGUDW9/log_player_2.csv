"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth $1,500,000. Let's start the conversation there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product is worth quite a bit less to me than what you're asking. How about we bring the price down to $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I understand this product has a different value to you, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,300,000. This leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's no longer worth the time and effort to negotiate with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000, and you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Cut your losses and buy from John."
