"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product is worth quite a bit less to me than what you're asking. How about we bring the price down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I understand this product has a different value to you, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,300,000. This leaves room for both of us to make a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
