"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $110?  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $120.  How about we split the difference at $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
