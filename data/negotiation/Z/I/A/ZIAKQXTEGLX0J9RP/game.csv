"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and you to still profit.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept the offer of $10,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a price of $11,000 for the product?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my target.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,750?  This would be a good compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,
