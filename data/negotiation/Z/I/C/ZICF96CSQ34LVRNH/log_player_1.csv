"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone helps build rapport and sets a friendly negotiating environment.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm inviting Bob to counter, showing flexibility and willingness to reach a deal. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** I'm keeping the price high enough that I can still accept John's offer if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's counteroffer suggests he's genuinely interested. By rejecting, I can potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Keeping John as an Option:** Selling to John is always an option, but I haven't exhausted my bargaining options with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. How about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to move closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming higher.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is only $250 away from my minimum, and I'm close to running out of negotiation rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting now guarantees a sale that's only slightly below my minimum. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John would be more profitable, but it risks losing out on the opportunity to negotiate with Bob."
