Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,500? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500 and it's a reasonable price compared to my $15,000 alternative. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
