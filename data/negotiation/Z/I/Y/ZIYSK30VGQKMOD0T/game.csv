"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To move things along, how about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
