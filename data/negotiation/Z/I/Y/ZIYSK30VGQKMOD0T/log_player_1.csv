"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. While I'd like to find a price that works for both of us, holding onto the product for now has more potential upside.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To move things along, how about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while it's higher than his initial offer, it's still too far from my minimum. I'll take the guaranteed profit.
