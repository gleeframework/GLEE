{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth starting the negotiation process to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have your limits, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement at this point. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but we're still too far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a final offer, and it reflects the value you'll gain from the product.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still too high.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $925,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I've already reached the point where I'm not sure we can close a deal. At this point, it's best to secure the product from John at $800,000.  It's a better price than Alice is willing to offer."
