"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be totally transparent, I can get the product elsewhere for $800,000.  If you'd be willing to match that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to pursue that other option.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to match the offer from the other party. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
