"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and the potential benefits it offers.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly starting the negotiation at a point that's advantageous to her.  While she may believe the product is worth $1,000,000 to both of you, her opening offer seeks a profit. You know John will sell the product for $1,000,000, giving you a better baseline. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price and open the door for further negotiation."
