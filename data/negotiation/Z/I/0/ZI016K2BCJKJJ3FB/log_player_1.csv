Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum price of $100, and it allows room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay that much.  I'll be ready to counter-offer if needed, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is significantly below my minimum value for the product, and I'm not willing to accept that price.  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering a lower price of $120 to Bob. This is a compromise from my original offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's a better offer than John's, and it's getting closer to my minimum value. To avoid the risk of losing out completely, I'm accepting Bob's offer."
