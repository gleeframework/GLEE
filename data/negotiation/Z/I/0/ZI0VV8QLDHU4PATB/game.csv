"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to at least receive $1,050,000 for this product.  This price still offers you a significant value compared to your alternative options.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
