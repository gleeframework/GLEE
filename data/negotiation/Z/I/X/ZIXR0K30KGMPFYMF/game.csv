"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am indeed interested, however, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. May I suggest a counteroffer of $8500? I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $8500 is a good price, I'm still a bit above that in my desired range.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9250.  This is a fair compromise, and I think we can make a deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
