{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Next Steps:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer:**  $13,000 is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than his maximum price point, and potentially profitable for Alice.
