"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the product sounds intriguing, $1100000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $900000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1050000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $950000?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $1030000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",1030000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1030000 is very close to what I'm willing to pay.  How about $1000000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm glad you're close to making a decision. I understand that $1000000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make one more concession and offer it to you for $1020000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider selling to you and explore other options.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
