# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product for a competitive price. I believe you'll find it's a great investment for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
