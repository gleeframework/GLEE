{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a fortune, and I know you'll appreciate its value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me to let this go.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $1,100,000 is my final offer.  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if Bob will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low. Let's split the difference.  $1,025,000 is my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $950,000, so I'll offer $975,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is still less than what I hoped for, it's getting close to my minimum. There's a risk Bob might walk away, and John's offer is only $800,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
