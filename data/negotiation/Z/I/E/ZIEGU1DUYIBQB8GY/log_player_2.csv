"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Below My Max:** My offer is well below my $100 maximum, increasing the chances of staying within budget even if Alice counteroffers.
* **Psychological Element:** Offering $90 instead of a round number like $100 might make Alice more receptive, as it seems like a more carefully considered price.

This strategy aims to quickly gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a very advantageous price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your range, $115 is still above your budget and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious and unlikely to go higher. This can encourage her to make a decision.
* **Reaching the Limit:** Offering $100 puts me at my absolute maximum budget.  I'm no longer willing to go over this amount.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Alice knows I have the option to buy from John at $100.  By matching that price, I'm making it clear that accepting my offer is her best chance to make a sale."
