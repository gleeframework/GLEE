I'm offering $17,500, which is halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want to make a decent profit."

Bob is getting too low for my liking.  Even though we only have a few rounds left, I'm not confident we'll reach a price I'm happy with.  It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
