"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to consider $125? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $130? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product considering its value.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to go down to $127? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",127.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go down to $127, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sacrifice too much profit. How about we meet at $129? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",129.0,Alice,7,
