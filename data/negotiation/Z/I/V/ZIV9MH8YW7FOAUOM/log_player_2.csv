"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it for $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,500 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's features, $12,500 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $8,500 represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range I'm willing to pay. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I won't overpay.  It leaves room for negotiation while also highlighting my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,000? I believe this price reflects the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has reduced her price, $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. There's still room for compromise, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also respecting my budget. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $9,500 represents a significant reduction from Alice's current price, but it's still within a reasonable range for both of us. It demonstrates my commitment to buying the product while showing that I won't go beyond my budget. This is a firm counteroffer, indicating that I'm reaching the limits of my negotiation."
