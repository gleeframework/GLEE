"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the value this product can bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $108. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Alice's offer for $108 is the best choice.  It's a lower price than John's offer, and you've already established a negotiation pattern with Alice.  While you could potentially continue negotiating and maybe get a slightly lower price, it's unlikely you'll get much lower than $108.  You also risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal entirely."
