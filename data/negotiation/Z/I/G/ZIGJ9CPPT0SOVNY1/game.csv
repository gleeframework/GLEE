"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,750. Let's see if we can make a deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250, which is a compromise from my previous offer. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's close this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However, $10,900 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,100, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal before we run out of time.",11100.0,Alice,7,
