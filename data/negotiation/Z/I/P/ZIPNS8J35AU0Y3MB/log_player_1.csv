Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's likely to negotiate, but it leaves room for compromise.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives you a cushion for negotiation and ensures you still make a profit.

**Remember:** You can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your desire to make a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think $10000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:**  You can propose a price closer to your desired range, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **Test Bob's commitment:** By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're not desperate for a sale, potentially increasing his willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from your previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:**  It still leaves you with a good profit margin above your minimum. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** This counteroffer avoids stalling the process and invites Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $9500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** While $9,000 is slightly below your desired profit margin, it's still significantly higher than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation rounds and potentially delays in selling the product. 
* **Potential for future business:**  Building a good relationship with Bob might lead to future opportunities. 

**In conclusion,**  accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 is a reasonable decision considering the current situation."
