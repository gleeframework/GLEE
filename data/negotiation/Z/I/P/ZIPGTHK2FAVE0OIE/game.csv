"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I understand your position.  However,  $875,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference and I'll come down to $925,000.  This reflects both the market value and the unique benefits this product offers to your business, ensuring it's a valuable investment for you. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product, especially considering the benefits it brings to your business.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both the market value and the unique potential this product offers you. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you.",900000.0,Alice,7,
