"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefits of the product for Bob, which might make him more inclined to consider my offer.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to start the negotiation with a strong initial position while leaving room for compromise.  It's important to remain flexible while also aiming for a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value.  

I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This provides me with a safety net and gives me leverage throughout the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can still get a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is still $300,000 below my minimum, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate.
* **Leverage:** I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher price, which gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 

By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price without risking selling the product for a much lower value."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by dropping my price, but I'm also justifying it by highlighting the product's benefits for Bob's business.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is the right price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Leverage:**  I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher price, which gives me strong leverage in the negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss compared to selling to John.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, as Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.

By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a price closer to my desired value without risking a significant loss."
