"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your top limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $160? It's still a good compromise for both of us.",160.0,Alice,5,
