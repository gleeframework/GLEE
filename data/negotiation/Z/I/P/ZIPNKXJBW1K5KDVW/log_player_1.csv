Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit. 
* **Anchoring:** Offering $120 first creates a high ""anchor"" price. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it might make your next offer (if he counters) seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can adjust your strategy knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
