Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the value for Bob while also showing confidence in the price.

**Strategy:**

* **Aim for a price as close to $12,000 as possible.** This maximizes your profit.
* **Be prepared to negotiate.**  Bob may counteroffer, and you'll need to decide whether to accept or counter.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away.**  If the negotiation drags on or Bob is unwilling to meet your price, you can always sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price.** While it's tempting to accept, it would be a major loss for you.
* **Rejection allows you to counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price.** You have room to negotiate and can aim for a higher price point.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but it's a last resort.** You'll get the full value, but it's better to try and maximize your earnings through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value for Bob:**  The message still highlights the deal's value to him.
* **Urgency:**  ""Close this deal quickly"" implies a limited time offer, potentially pushing Bob towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your desired price.**  While you'd prefer $9,250, a $9,000 sale is still a good outcome, especially considering the potential for further negotiation.
* **The deal is likely to be finalized quickly.**  Both parties are showing willingness to compromise, increasing the likelihood of a successful transaction.
* **Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but it's a risk.**  You could potentially lose out on a faster and smoother sale.

**It's important to consider the value of your time and effort.**  While a slightly lower price is less than ideal, the benefit of a quick deal might outweigh the potential for a few hundred dollars more."
