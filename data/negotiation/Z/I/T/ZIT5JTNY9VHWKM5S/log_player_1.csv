Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get the highest price possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, she starts by aiming slightly below that to entice Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer. If Bob is completely turned off by the price, Alice can always slightly reduce it before going to John. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $150 to Bob right away might make Alice appear desperate to sell quickly, potentially leading Bob to lowball her."
