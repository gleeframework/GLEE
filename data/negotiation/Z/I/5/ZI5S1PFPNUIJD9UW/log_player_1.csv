"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but also ensuring I get more than my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I leave room for Bob to counteroffer, encouraging him to continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged.  Starting high allows me to potentially secure a higher price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary.  I'll monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or at least secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **John is a Backup:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, I'm still optimistic about getting a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired range.  I'll use the remaining rounds to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach an agreement. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500?  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I'm counteroffering at $8,500, which is a significant drop from my initial $10,000 but still above my minimum price. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob that the product is worth a lot to him and that the price is still a good deal.
* **Setting a Clear Expectation:**  I'm making it clear that $8,500 is my final concession, encouraging Bob to seriously consider accepting.

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price close to my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** By moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm pushing Bob to either accept or make a more reasonable counteroffer.
* **Managing the Rounds:** With 7 rounds left, I want to move quickly and get closer to a deal without getting too caught up in small increments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit more than I had budgeted for. Would you consider $7,200? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, $7,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum by continuing negotiations.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but I still see potential for a better deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer with a Small Concessions:** I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value and Compromise:** I'll emphasize the value of the product for Bob and reiterate my desire to reach a fair compromise.
* **Managing the Rounds:** With 6 rounds remaining, I need to be mindful of time and work towards a deal without getting stuck in endless back-and-forth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7,800? This price reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm counteroffering at $7,800, which is the midpoint between Bob's last offer of $7,200 and my previous offer of $8,500. This shows a willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value and Compromise:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob and highlight this price as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  I'm trying to create a sense of urgency by implying that this might be my final offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Final Push:** I'm aiming to close the deal in this round by offering a price that's close to my minimum, making it difficult for Bob to reject.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  While I'm aiming for a deal, I'm still open to further negotiation if needed. 
* **Managing Rounds:**  With 5 rounds left, I want to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, to be completely transparent, I've also found a similar product for $8,000. To make a deal work for me, I'd need to be closer to $7,400.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,400 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Competition:**  Bob's mention of finding a similar product for $8,000 signals that he's not desperate and might be willing to walk away. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations with Bob risks him walking away and leaving me with a lower price than John's guaranteed offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob.
* **Time Management:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the time pressure increases.  
* **John's Offer is a Safe Option:** Given the uncertainty surrounding Bob's offer and his potential to walk away, accepting John's offer is the safest and most sensible choice."
