"Bob, I'm offering you something incredibly valuable. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and while I have a standing offer for $1,000,000, I'd rather see it go to someone who truly appreciates its potential. How about we settle on $900,000? It's a fair price considering its true worth.",900000.0,Alice,1,
