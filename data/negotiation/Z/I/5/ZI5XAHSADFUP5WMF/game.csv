"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90?  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to complete this transaction. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $102. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not comfortable going that high.  Let's split the difference at $98. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to complete this transaction. If you're not willing to go lower than $102, then I'll have to go with John's offer instead.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better than $98. How about $100.50? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",100.5,Alice,7,
