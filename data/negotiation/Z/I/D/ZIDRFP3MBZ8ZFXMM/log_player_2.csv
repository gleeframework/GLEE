# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth $10,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
