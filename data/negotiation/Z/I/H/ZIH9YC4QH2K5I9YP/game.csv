"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $80. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $85, which would be $82.50. Can you consider that?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $82.50. I can do $87.50, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $87.50, which would be $85. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $85. I can do $88, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I put into finding a buyer like you. What do you think?",88.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $88, which would be $85.25. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider that?",85.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you at $85.25. I can do $89, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I put into finding a buyer like you. What do you think?",89.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $89, which would be $85.75. This is my final offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",85.75,Bob,10,
