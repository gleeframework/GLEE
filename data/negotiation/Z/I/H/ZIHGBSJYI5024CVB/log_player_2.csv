"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better deal than $15,000, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. Since the product is only worth $8,000 to her, there's room for both of you to benefit from a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000 but still higher than the product's worth to her.  This leaves room for negotiation, but also shows I'm serious about purchasing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but $13,000 is still too high.  I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price. There's still a gap between her offer and my counteroffer, and I believe she'll want to close that gap rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $10,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet her halfway. This might be enough to convince Alice to accept, given she's already lowered her price once."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While she's lowered her price, she's not budging much. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm getting close to my limit, but I want to see if we can get to a price closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet her halfway. This is my final offer, and if Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John.  I believe she'll be willing to accept it, as it's closer to her desired price than mine, and she might risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge further, and her latest offer of $13,500 is too high for me. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $15,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation with Alice."
