"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* You have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within your budget and saves you $250,000.

It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to get the best possible price."
