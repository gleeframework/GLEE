Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage. The goal is to see if you can get Bob to pay a price closer to his perceived value without going below your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening, leaving room for negotiation while staying above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:**  By presenting it as a ""fair deal,"" you aim to anchor the negotiation closer to your asking price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be strategic. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have the security of John's offer, so don't feel pressured to accept anything below your minimum!"
