"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $12,500. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $14,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
