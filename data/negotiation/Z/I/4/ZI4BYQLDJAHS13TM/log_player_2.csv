"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $110 is above Bob's maximum budget of $100.
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, I'm only willing to pay $95 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to buy the product but needs to stay within his budget.
* He's making a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, hoping to start the negotiation process. 
* He's being polite but firm in his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his $100 limit. 
* There's still room for negotiation, and Bob is likely to find a better price if he rejects and counteroffers again.
* He can always buy from John for $100, which is his fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $100. I'm sure we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is sticking to his maximum budget of $100.
* He's emphasizing that he's willing to meet Alice halfway to show good faith. 
* He's expressing confidence that they can reach an agreement, hoping to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $102. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* While Alice's offer of $102 is very close to his budget, he can still get the product for $100 from John.
* There is no guarantee that Alice will accept any further counteroffers, and he risks wasting more time in negotiations.
* Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $100."
