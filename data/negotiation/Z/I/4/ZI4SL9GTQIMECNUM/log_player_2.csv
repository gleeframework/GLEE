"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $800,000 maximum and suggests there's room for negotiation. It's in your best interest to counter-offer and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I can offer you $600,000 for it."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's opening price, but it's important to create room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief explanation about your budget limitations makes your position more understandable (even if Alice knows you have more leeway). 
* **Testing the Waters:** This aggressive counter-offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the potential benefits it offers your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still far too high. By rejecting again, you signal that you're serious about a much lower price point. You're still well within your negotiation timeframe, and there's a chance Alice will move closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You're showing willingness to move, but not drastically. A $100,000 increase signals you're negotiating seriously but holding your ground.
* **Firm Limit:** By stating your ""absolute limit"" you're creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Alice to make a more significant move.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice that you have the fallback of John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  To be frank, I've already received significant interest from other buyers. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice is using a classic negotiation tactic by mentioning ""other buyers"" and a ""final offer"" to create pressure.  Don't let this sway you; it's often a bluff.
* **Still Too High:**  Even with her ""compromise,"" the price is still double your maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll come down to your level in one step, but there's room to negotiate further.
* **Leverage:** You still have John's offer as a backup plan, so you're not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $800,000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with another option I have lined up."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're now at the point where it's time to show your hand. By presenting this as your ""final offer"" you increase the pressure on Alice.
* **Walk Away Point:** You've reached your maximum budget.  Being willing to walk away is crucial in negotiation. 
* **Alternative Reinforced:**  Mentioning your ""other option"" again reminds Alice that you have a viable alternative if she doesn't budge. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. Alice might reject this offer, forcing you to either accept John's price or restart negotiations. However, given her previous concessions, there's a good chance she'll be willing to accept a price close to this to close the deal."
