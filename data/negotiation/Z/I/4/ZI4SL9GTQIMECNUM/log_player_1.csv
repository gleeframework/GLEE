"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for your business."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with $2,200,000, you set a high anchor. Even if this price is unrealistic, it influences Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" adds an air of exclusivity without revealing specific details.

This is just the opening move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I can offer you $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his perceived value of the product ($800,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's too early to settle for that. There's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the potential benefits it offers your business."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Firm:** We're lowering our price by $300,000, indicating flexibility, but not drastically. This keeps the price well above Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits to his business, subtly nudging him towards his higher perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to the middle ground. It's a strong signal that we're serious about selling, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $100,000. This suggests he's willing to negotiate but being very cautious.
* **Potential Upside:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000. There's still a chance to extract some of that value.
* **John as Backup:**  The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. We're not desperate to accept a low offer yet. 

We'll use the next counteroffer to try and close the gap significantly or gauge Bob's true willingness to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  To be frank, I've already received significant interest from other buyers. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. "", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other buyers"" (even if hypothetical) injects a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act.
* **Finality:** Framing this as your ""final offer"" adds weight to the proposal and signals that you're serious about moving on if it's rejected.
* **Substantial Drop:** The $300,000 reduction is significant and shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Strategic Price:** This price is slightly above your guaranteed sale to John ($1,500,000), creating an incentive for Bob to accept before potentially losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $800,000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with another option I have lined up. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Bob's Maximum:** Bob has now offered his true valuation of the product ($800,000). It's unlikely he'll go higher. 
* **Profitable Deal:** While not the ideal price, $800,000 is still a significant profit margin.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Bob mentioning ""another option"" implies he has alternatives. Pushing further might make him walk away, leaving you with John's lower offer. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with a lower price or a prolonged negotiation."
