"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for your business.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I can offer you $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the potential benefits it offers your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  To be frank, I've already received significant interest from other buyers. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $800,000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with another option I have lined up.",800000.0,Bob,6,
