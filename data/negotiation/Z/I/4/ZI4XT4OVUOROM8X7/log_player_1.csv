Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value of the product to me is $800,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied. I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for $1,500,000.  I have a feeling we can close this deal on my terms in the next few rounds."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,400,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's final offer is getting close, but it's not enough for me. I'm better off selling to John and getting my desired price. It's risky to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's a chance he might walk away."
