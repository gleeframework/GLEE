"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $14,000. I think this is a great compromise and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? This feels like a good compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,500? I think this is a fair compromise and I'm excited about the prospect of selling the product to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which I think is a fair price considering our previous discussions and your minimum price.  Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Bob,6,
