"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad to hear that you're willing to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
