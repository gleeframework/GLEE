Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm willing to accept.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  My message highlights the potential value for Bob (""great deal"") while also signaling that I'm firm on this price (""willing to accept""). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer is high enough that Bob might counteroffer, giving us the opportunity for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll only accept an offer from Bob if it's at least $1,200,000. 
* **Bob's potential counteroffers:** I need to be prepared for Bob to offer a lower price.  I'll need to consider if it's worth negotiating further or simply accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still $300,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's room for further negotiation. I can likely secure a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I don't need to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** This price is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language (""fair price"", ""compromise"") to encourage Bob to see this as a mutually beneficial solution.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob. 
* **Bob's potential response:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to decide if it's worth making another counteroffer or simply going with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is still $280,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Small Increment:** Bob's offer is only a $20,000 increase from his previous offer. This shows he's not willing to budge much.
* **John's offer is a strong alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price. I will likely offer a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer, but still significantly lower than my minimum. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will likely accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $930,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're willing to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer of $930,000 meets Bob halfway between his latest offer and my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still $270,000 below my minimum acceptable price, but it shows that I am willing to consider his budget constraints. 
* **Closing Language:** The message emphasizes this as my ""best offer,"" making it clear that further negotiation is unlikely. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  I am still prepared to accept John's offer if this counteroffer is rejected.
* **Bob's likely response:** This is likely to be the final offer before I accept John's deal. If Bob rejects this, it indicates that he is unwilling to meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $915,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Bob's final offer of $915,000 is still $285,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John's offer is the best option:** John has consistently been willing to pay my minimum price. Accepting his offer ensures I get the best possible price for my product.

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, his unwillingness to meet my minimum price means that accepting John's offer is the most financially responsible decision."
