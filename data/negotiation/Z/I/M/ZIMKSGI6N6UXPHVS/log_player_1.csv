"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for bargaining:** $120 gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Friendly tone:** Keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation sets a positive tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum of $80, there's still room to increase the price.
* **I have 10 rounds:**  I'm not under pressure to accept immediately, and I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup:**  While John is a safe option, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $95 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $105 is still above my minimum of $80, so I'm still getting a good price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm staying friendly and positive to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway.  $105 is still a little too high for me, though.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $100 is very close to my target price of $105 and is a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk getting a lower price or wasting time, especially with John as a backup option.
* **Closing the deal:** Accepting this offer ensures a successful transaction and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
