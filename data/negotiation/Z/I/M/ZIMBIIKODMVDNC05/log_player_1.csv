Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity. This could incentivize Bob to act quickly.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and open tone encourages a positive negotiation experience. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum is $15,000, so you have some wiggle room."
