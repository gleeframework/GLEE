"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I can meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell it to you for $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I've already made two concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $20000, so the effective price would be $1600000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
