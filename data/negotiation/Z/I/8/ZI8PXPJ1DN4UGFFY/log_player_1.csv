"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is closer to my minimum value, but I think I can still get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be agreeable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $92 is still a good deal and it's better than selling to John for $80. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, so it's better to secure the sale now."
