Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth millions. I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob, aiming to justify a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** The high initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing on a price well above $1,000,000.

**Important:** If Bob rejects this offer, you have the security of John's offer and can re-evaluate your strategy."
