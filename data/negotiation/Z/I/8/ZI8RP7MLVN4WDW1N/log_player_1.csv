Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** I'm still open to negotiation, but not willing to go below $1,000,000.
* **It's a ""round number"" that's easy to understand:**  This makes the offer seem fair and straightforward.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If I know Bob is a tough negotiator, I might start higher. If he's more agreeable, I might start lower.
* **My time constraints:**  If I need to sell the product quickly, I might be more willing to accept a lower price.
* **John's offer:**  I need to keep in mind that John is offering $1,000,000.  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, I might be more likely to accept John's offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to consider a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'd love to hear if you're open to negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering a price that's:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Lower than my original offer:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Closer to my minimum acceptable price:**  This gives me more room to negotiate in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable paying. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $810,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's also a good compromise, considering that we've both made concessions.  I'm happy to accept this deal."
