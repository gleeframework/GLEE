"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to consider a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'd love to hear if you're open to negotiating further.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable paying. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",810000.0,Bob,4,
