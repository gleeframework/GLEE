"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet halfway at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price based on the product's value to me. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
