"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is still significantly higher than your value for it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit.  I believe this price is fair, considering your value for the product and my maximum budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer and propose a price of $1,025,000, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
