"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  While it's lower than your maximum, you have room to negotiate and potentially save more money.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,025,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I believe I can push for a lower price, as my maximum is $1,500,000 and I still have room to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer and propose a price of $1,025,000, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,012,500, which is still within my budget and a good price considering my maximum was $1,500,000. While I could continue negotiating, it seems like Alice is firm on this price and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by rejecting her offer. This price offers a significant saving compared to buying from John and is likely the best deal I can get."
