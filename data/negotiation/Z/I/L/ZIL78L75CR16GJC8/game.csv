"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is considerably below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds significant value, and I'm willing to meet closer to your price.  How about $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, but we're still a ways apart. This product offers significant returns, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. How about $1,040,000? That reflects my desire to strike a deal while recognizing the product's true value.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm serious about purchasing this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
