Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $105 is getting closer but I'm still a bit away from where I want to be. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $102.50. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $108 is a fair price for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $108 is still within your price limit, and you're getting a decent deal compared to John's offer. It's a good idea to accept and avoid further negotiations."
