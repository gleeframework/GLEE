While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high for my budget. I need to keep negotiating to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 4

John's offer of $10,000 is within my budget and a much safer option. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more certain deal."
