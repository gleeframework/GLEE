Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, which might encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer creates an opening for Bob to counter, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects my offer, I have the option to go to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Plan B is still viable:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $12,000, which is a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to avoid losing too much. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is close to Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Justification for price:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and making a case for why $9,500 is fair.
* **Remaining above minimum:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm not sacrificing too much.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for Bob to make another counteroffer if he's not happy with this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price,  accepting Bob's offer leaves room for future negotiation. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time, and selling to John is a guaranteed outcome but at a lower price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer is a calculated risk that balances the potential for a higher price with the certainty of selling to John."
