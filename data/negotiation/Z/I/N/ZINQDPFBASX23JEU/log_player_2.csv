"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's above your maximum budget, and you can get the same product from John for significantly less. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product provides significant value, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay more than $800,000, but I'm not going to jump to her price yet.  I'll counteroffer again to try and reach a more favorable price."
