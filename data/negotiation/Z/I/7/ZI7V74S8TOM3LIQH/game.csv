"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a living, too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. How about we meet at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're a savvy negotiator, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, but I need to make a decision soon. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $15,500, or I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,7,
