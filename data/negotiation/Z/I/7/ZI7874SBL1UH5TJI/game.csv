"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I think your starting price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $550,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I still think $900,000 is too high. I'm willing to compromise and propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
