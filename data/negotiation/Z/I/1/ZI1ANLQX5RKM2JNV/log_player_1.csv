Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value.  I will counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations. However, I'm still firm on a price closer to my minimum value.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000.  It's better to secure this sale rather than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
