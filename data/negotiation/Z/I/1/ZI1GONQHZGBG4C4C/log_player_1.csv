"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly approach:** I'm keeping the message friendly to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price is still higher than my minimum ($80) so I can adjust it if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to negotiate further. 
* **Building value:** By continuing the negotiation, I have the opportunity to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, I'm looking for a bit closer to $100. How about $95?  This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make it worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counteroffering at $95, which is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that the price still offers Bob a good deal, reinforcing the product's value in his eyes.
* **Staying firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in completely. My counteroffer is still above my minimum price and leaves room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm still interested in the product and am willing to pay $92 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $92 is only $8 away from my initial offer of $100 and is significantly higher than my minimum of $80.
* **Limited time:** We're already in Round 4, and the risk of further negotiation is that Bob might lose interest or I might not be able to get a better offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling at $92 guarantees a good profit margin and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $80."
