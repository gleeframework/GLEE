"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $140 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let's make this work!",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $135 is still a bit high for me, though. How about $132?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",132.0,Bob,4,
