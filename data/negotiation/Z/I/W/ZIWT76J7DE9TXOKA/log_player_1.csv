Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm looking for a price around $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you provide a reason for the high price without explicitly stating your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Phrases like ""looking for a price around"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating a deal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him.  Offering a price significantly higher could make him walk away.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation.  
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your starting price to be slightly less aggressive."
