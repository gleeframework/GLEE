Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to give me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There is still room for me to lower the price a bit if needed, especially if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Staying above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $12,000.  I can always go to John as a backup if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product and your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so taking a slightly lower offer from Bob isn't a huge risk."
