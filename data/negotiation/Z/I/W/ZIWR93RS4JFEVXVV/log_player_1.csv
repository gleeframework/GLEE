"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant offer that shows I'm serious about selling, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's initial offer and the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is more than selling to John, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a further compromise on my part, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is too low. While $10,500 is more than selling to John,  the negotiations have gone on for several rounds, and I'm not confident we will reach a mutually acceptable price. It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
