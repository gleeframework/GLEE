Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to negotiate for a better deal.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing the negotiation. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 11750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  I'm still a little ways off from $11,750.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? This is a fair price that would allow us to both close this deal.  Let's see if we can make this work!
