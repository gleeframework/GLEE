"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing the negotiation. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  I'm still a little ways off from $11,750.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? This is a fair price that would allow us to both close this deal.  Let's see if we can make this work!",11000.0,Bob,6,
