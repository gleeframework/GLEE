Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point - it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better.  I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, and still a profitable sale for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his $100 offer. While I would prefer to earn more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation that could potentially lead to no sale at all.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so selling to John is the best option at this point."
