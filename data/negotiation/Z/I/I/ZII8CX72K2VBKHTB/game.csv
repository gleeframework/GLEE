"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, while also giving you a good deal on the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. How about we settle at $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us and avoids any further negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
