"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you'd like to pay $8,500, but I'm not sure that's enough for me to let go of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. How about we discuss $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $9,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $9,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit more for this product.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $9,000 is my absolute limit.  I'm ready to make this deal happen right now, but if we can't agree, I'll have to go with a different seller.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're eager to make a deal, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a better price for this product. I'm willing to make one last offer. How about we meet at $9,500? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's worth it for this product. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
