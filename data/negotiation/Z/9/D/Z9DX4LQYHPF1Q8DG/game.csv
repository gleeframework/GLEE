"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still above my limit. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,000,000.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still sticking with my offer of $1,000,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm not comfortable going any higher.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your profit and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
