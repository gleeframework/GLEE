# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.
