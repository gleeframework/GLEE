"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for potential concessions while aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting slightly below this gives the impression of a good deal without completely sacrificing potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $100,000 difference between my offer and Bob's perceived value provides space for negotiation and potential counteroffers over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than both my asking price and his own perceived value of the product. While I want to reach a deal, accepting this offer would leave a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. I'm confident that through further negotiation, we can arrive at a price that is more mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $1,300,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still maintains a strong profit margin for me while moving closer to Bob's initial offer. 
* **Encouraging Reciprocity:**  My concession may encourage Bob to make a counter-concession in the next round, moving us toward a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference and try $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but $1,250,000 is still a significant amount less than my ideal price. While Bob is suggesting compromises, his offer increments are getting smaller. This might imply he's reaching his upper limit.  I believe I can push for a slightly better outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $1,275,000?  It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my concession amount to signal that I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting we ""settle this right now,"" I'm introducing a touch of urgency, aiming to encourage Bob to accept before I reconsider my position.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This offer splits the difference between our previous offers, making it seem like a fair compromise. 
* **Above the ""Walk Away"" Point:**  Importantly, $1,275,000 is still a significant profit above my alternative sale to John."
