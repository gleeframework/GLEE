Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $1,200,000 to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob would rather walk away.  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer, so leaving some room for negotiation is wise.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a one-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Confident, emphasizing the product's value. The mention of ""other interested parties"" adds a subtle sense of urgency.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 gives Bob a potential gain ($50,000) while netting you a significant profit ($150,000). 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how Bob values things beyond the $1,200,000. He might be a tough negotiator or highly motivated to acquire the product. 
* **One-Time Offer?**  While stating it's a one-time offer can add pressure, be prepared to walk away if Bob tries to negotiate too low. You always have John as a backup."
