"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my willingness to purchase it immediately. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is considerably below the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit above my comfortable range.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,600,000. This is a fair price, allowing both of us to walk away satisfied.  I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
