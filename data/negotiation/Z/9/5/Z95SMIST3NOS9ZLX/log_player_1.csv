"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to frame the high price as justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message expresses openness to discussion and ""finding a mutually beneficial agreement,"" signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial high price, I significantly exceed my minimum.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By starting high, I set the initial anchor point for the negotiation, potentially leading Bob to propose counteroffers closer to my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my willingness to purchase it immediately. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have room to negotiate and try to bring him closer to my desired range. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I believe I can potentially secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is considerably below the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $300,000 from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  However, the concession is not too drastic, demonstrating that I'm still aiming for a strong price.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value, subtly countering Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground,"" encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my target range. 

This counteroffer balances firmness on price with a willingness to negotiate, aiming to move the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit above my comfortable range.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,600,000. This is a fair price, allowing both of us to walk away satisfied.  I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away or my counteroffer being significantly lower than his expectations isn't worth it. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
