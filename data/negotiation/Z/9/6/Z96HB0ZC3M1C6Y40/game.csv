"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it, given it's in good condition.  Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there at $155.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's fair for both of us, and I can get it from John for that price if we can't agree.",150.0,Bob,4,
