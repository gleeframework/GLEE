"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Can you consider my offer?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, due to the high demand and limited supply, I am unable to accept the offer at $60. I propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. This is a special discount considering our ongoing relationship. Please let me know if this works for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $80. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it offers. Can you consider my offer?",85.0,Bob,6,
