"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, considering the value I place on it. Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering both our perspectives on the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to come down to $1,325,000. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
