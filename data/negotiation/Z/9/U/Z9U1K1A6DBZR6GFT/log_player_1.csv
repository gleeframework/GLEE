Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It's also a price that I believe might be attractive to Bob, but I'm prepared to lower it if necessary. 

I'll be keeping an eye on the negotiation and will be ready to accept a lower price if it's closer to my minimum goal of $800,000, or to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum goal, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I believe I can still get a better price by negotiating further. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer.  It's a price I believe is still fair considering the value of the product to me. 

I'm hopeful this counteroffer will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is only slightly higher than my minimum goal of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further. It's not worth risking a prolonged negotiation that could result in him walking away entirely.  It's time to accept the offer and move forward with the sale."
