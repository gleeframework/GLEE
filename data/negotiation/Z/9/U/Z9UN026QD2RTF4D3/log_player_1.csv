``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for you. It also shows you are open to a deal, but are not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation and potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still far from the value you place on the product. Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation and potentially a higher price. There's still a significant gap between you and Bob's valuation."
