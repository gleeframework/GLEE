Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a decent amount, I'm holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,050,000 is the lowest I can go at this point. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1,025,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,025,000 is a good price, especially since I'm not sure how much more room for negotiation there is. It's also slightly better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
