"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's starting price of $14,000 is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $12,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but it's still above my ideal price and what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm getting close to the point where John's offer makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm splitting the difference between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below my maximum and John's offer."
