Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough that I make a decent profit, but it's also low enough that Bob might be willing to accept it, especially if he values the product at $12,000. This allows for room for negotiation, and if Bob rejects it, I can make a counteroffer based on his response."
