,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $10,500 is a bit high. I would like to propose $10,000 as a final offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,4,
