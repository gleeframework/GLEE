"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's aiming for a price below $1,200,000, and $1,400,000 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and hopefully get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I'm still paying a premium for the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum value.  I'm offering you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,350,000 is closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate further and potentially get closer to the $1,200,000 he's hoping for.  By rejecting, he keeps the negotiation open and maintains leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
