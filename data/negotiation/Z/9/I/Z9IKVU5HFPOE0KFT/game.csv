"Alice,  $15,000 is well above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant jump from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. Let's try $13,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",13000.0,Alice,5,
