"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. There is room for negotiation, and he should aim for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $15,000 is well above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $12,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price. He can still get a better deal, and it's worth exploring further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant jump from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. Let's try $13,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is being stubborn and refusing to come down further.  While the offer is slightly better than her initial price, it is still above Bob's budget.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice's counteroffers are not reasonable.  The best option for Bob at this point is to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further rounds of unproductive negotiation."
