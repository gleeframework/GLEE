Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with the highest possible price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept. This allows me to gauge his interest and establish a starting point for negotiation.  Since I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price, I can afford to be assertive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is close to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $925,000 is a decent offer, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation.  There's a chance Bob might eventually come up to my desired price, but there's also a risk of him walking away, and I'm not willing to take that chance.  Selling to John provides the most secure and profitable outcome at this point."
