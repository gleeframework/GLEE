Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Aiming for Maximum Profit:**  A price of $19,000 aims to maximize your profit while still being potentially appealing to Bob, considering it's worth $10,000 to him. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't have significant time constraints or that selling to John is guaranteed. If time is a major factor, you might offer a lower price to Bob to increase the likelihood of a quick sale."
