# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is selling for $1,100,000, while John is selling for $1,200,000. This means accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000.
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to maximize savings."
