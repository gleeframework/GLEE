"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $18,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about we try $13,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I'm motivated to sell, but I need to get a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about we settle at $16,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial asking price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $16,000 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to keep it under $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",14000.0,Bob,6,
