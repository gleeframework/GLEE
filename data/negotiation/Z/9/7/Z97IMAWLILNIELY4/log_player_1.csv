Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point, as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price but am also willing to potentially negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a lower price, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a compromise and be willing to meet me halfway.  If he doesn't accept, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price of $100.  While I would love to get closer to my desired price, it's clear that further negotiation with Bob will not be fruitful.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $100, which is my minimum."
