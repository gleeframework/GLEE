"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1200000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1150000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reviewing the market demand and the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1225000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1225000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the product's value to me and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm hopeful you'll consider this final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
