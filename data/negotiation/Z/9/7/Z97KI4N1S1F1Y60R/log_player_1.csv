Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. I know the product is worth $120 to me, so I'm not willing to sell it for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a price of $115, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my original asking price,  Bob's offer of $108 is significantly lower than my desired price. It's getting too close to the value the product has for Bob. I'd rather secure the guaranteed $120 from John."
