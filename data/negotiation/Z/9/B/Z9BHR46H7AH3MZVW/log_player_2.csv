(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with my maximum price, which is what John is willing to sell it for. This gives me the best chance to get a deal, while also staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,500,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm serious about buying, but still keeping it below her price. This should encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice to see if I can get her closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm willing to pay more but still keeping it below her price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, the negotiation has gone on for several rounds and Alice is not willing to come down significantly on her price. While $1,450,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Since I have a guaranteed purchase option with John at $1,000,000, it makes more sense to secure the product at that price and avoid further negotiation."
