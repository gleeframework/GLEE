"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",12500.0,Alice,3,
