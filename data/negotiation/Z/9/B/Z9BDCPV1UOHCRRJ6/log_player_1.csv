{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm offering it for $200.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a relatively high price, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $140 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $145.  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product, and this is the best price I can offer."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. I'll sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I at least cover my minimum price."
