"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than the $12,000 he'd pay John, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value the product holds for you. Let's find a compromise! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $11,000 is still more than his ideal price, it's lower than the $12,000 he'd pay John and a good compromise given Alice's counteroffer.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and needing to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
