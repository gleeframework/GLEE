Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's perceived value is $8,000, Alice possesses the advantage of a guaranteed sale at $15,000. Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying above her minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""unique value"" to nudge Bob away from his $8,000 valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Phrasing like ""proposing"" and ""what do you think?"" implies flexibility, potentially leading to a counter-offer within Alice's desired range.

**Important:** This strategy assumes Alice has some time before John's guaranteed purchase. If time is extremely limited, a slightly lower initial offer might be more practical to ensure a quicker sale."
