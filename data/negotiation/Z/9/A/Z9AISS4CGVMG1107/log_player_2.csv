Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  This is my best price, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, though. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000, which will bring the total value of the deal to $17,000. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiation is getting close to his maximum price. While Alice's offer is tempting with the added value, it's still slightly higher than Bob's ideal price. With 5 rounds remaining, there is a risk that the negotiation will continue to be drawn out. 

Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John at his set price of $15,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
