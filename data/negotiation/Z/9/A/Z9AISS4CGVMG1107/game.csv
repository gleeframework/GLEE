"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  This is my best price, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, though. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000, which will bring the total value of the deal to $17,000. This is my final counteroffer.",17000.0,Alice,5,
