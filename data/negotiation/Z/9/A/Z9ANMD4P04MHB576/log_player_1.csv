Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still ensures you're making a significant profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer, or to accept a counteroffer that's slightly lower.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher offer might make Bob feel like you're being unreasonable and could lead to a quick rejection. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum desired value.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product at a price that's still significantly below its true worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting very close to my minimum.  It's also a good compromise, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.  

I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
