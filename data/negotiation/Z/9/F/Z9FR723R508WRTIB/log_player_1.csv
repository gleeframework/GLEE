"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get a better price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $125. This is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to reach a compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
