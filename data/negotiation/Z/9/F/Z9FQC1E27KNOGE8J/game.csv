"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop the price to $9,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make some profit. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's get this deal done!",8500.0,Alice,5,
