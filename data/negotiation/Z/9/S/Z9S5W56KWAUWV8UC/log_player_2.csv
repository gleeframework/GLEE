"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,000,000.  He has a clear upper limit of $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount while still leaving room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential compromise and a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within Bob's acceptable range and is significantly lower than the price John is offering.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John."
