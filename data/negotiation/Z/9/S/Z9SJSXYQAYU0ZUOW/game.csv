"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $8,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
