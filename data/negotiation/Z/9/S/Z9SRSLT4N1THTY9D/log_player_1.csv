Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping to strike a deal that's fair to both of us, while still maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $9,750. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but still above what Bob is willing to pay. I believe this price is fair and gives both of us a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough. I've already been through two rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a sure thing and guarantees me a good profit."
