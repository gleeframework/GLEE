Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'd ideally want to pay less, but any price closer to this makes the deal more appealing to him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** The prices between $1,200,000 (Bob's value) and $1,500,000 (your minimum) represent the range where a deal can be made.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position with John as a backup. This allows you to start high with Bob, aiming for the upper end of the ZOPA. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  This price is just below your guaranteed price from John, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Justification:** While you don't need to explicitly state your reasons, the message implies the product's value justifies the price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you start high, a slightly lower offer from Bob could still be acceptable.

**Important Note:** Bob may counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but remember your walk-away point is $1,500,000."
