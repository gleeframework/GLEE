"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $13,500 is cheaper than buying from John.
* **It's a fair price for Bob:**  Bob is looking to save money, and getting the product for $13,500 is within his budget and saves him $1,500 compared to John. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice already indicated this is her lowest price. While another counteroffer is possible, it's likely that the price won't drop significantly."
