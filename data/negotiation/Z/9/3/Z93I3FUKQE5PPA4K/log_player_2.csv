{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While you could accept and make a profit, it's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and the opportunity to work together. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my budget of $1,200,000. While we've made some progress, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that works for me. To avoid further negotiations and ensure I get the product within my budget, I will choose to buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
