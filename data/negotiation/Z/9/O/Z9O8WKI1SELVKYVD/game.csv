"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. The value of this product is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'd like to counter with $1,300,000. This price reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to negotiate further, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make an offer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product.
