"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a game-changer in its field, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's too early in the negotiation to buy from John as I haven't explored Alice's willingness to lower her price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of this product,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. However, she is showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise.  I'm still holding out for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I can offer while still making it worth my while to sell the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my goal, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $10,200?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 10200}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget.  However, the fact that she's met me halfway shows she's willing to negotiate. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap and hopefully secure a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits both of us. How about $10,300? It's a fair price, and it would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10300}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer it to you for $10,400, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort you've put into negotiating with me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is down to $10,400, which is still above my budget. With only one round left, the odds of her going lower are slim.  Since John is offering the product at my target price of $10,000, it's more efficient to cut my losses and buy from him. I've already invested a significant amount of time in negotiating with Alice, and there's no guarantee we'll reach a deal."
