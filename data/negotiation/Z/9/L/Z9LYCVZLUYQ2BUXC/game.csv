"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a game-changer in its field, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of this product,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I can offer while still making it worth my while to sell the product to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my goal, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $10,200?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits both of us. How about $10,300? It's a fair price, and it would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer it to you for $10,400, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort you've put into negotiating with me.",10400.0,Alice,9,
