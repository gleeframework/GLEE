Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  

**Important:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to ensure a sale (even at a lower profit), a price closer to $1,000,000 would be more suitable."
