Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $20,000 gives you the potential to earn a $5,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested but finds the price a bit steep."
