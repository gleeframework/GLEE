"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $8,000, and her initial offer is $1,000 over that. 
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** You have 10 rounds to get a better price, and you're not obligated to buy from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.**  If negotiations fail, you can always get the product for your maximum price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. It's also still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** There's still room for Alice to counter with a price higher than $7,500, but hopefully closer to your maximum. 
* **Time is on your side:**  With 9 rounds remaining, you can afford to be patient and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your maximum, you're still $500 over your ideal price.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** You've shown your willingness to negotiate, and Alice has lowered her price.  It's likely you can reach a compromise.
* **John remains a viable option.** If negotiations break down, you can still purchase the product from John at your maximum price.

**Next Step:**  Counteroffer again.  Try lowering the price to $8,250. This should create further incentive for Alice to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise between Alice's previous offer and your ideal price. It demonstrates your willingness to meet her halfway.
* **Strategic Lowering:** The $250 decrease from the previous round shows a continued effort to negotiate, potentially leading to a quicker agreement. 
* **Pressure to Accept:** If Alice rejects this offer, she'll likely have to come down even further to avoid the risk of you accepting John's offer."
