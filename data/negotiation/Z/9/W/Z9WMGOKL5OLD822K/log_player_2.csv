"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. Would you like to purchase it from me for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the initial offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000 less than John's price.**  This is a significant savings for you.
* **The negotiation is going in your favor.**  You've already lowered the price from $12,000 to $11,500. It's likely you won't get it much lower.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could counteroffer again, there's a chance Alice will reject it and you'll end up paying John's higher price.  

It's a good compromise to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a good price."
