Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, exceeding her minimum price of $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the risk of waiting for other buyers and guarantees a sale above her minimum.

By setting a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases the likelihood of a quick and profitable sale."
