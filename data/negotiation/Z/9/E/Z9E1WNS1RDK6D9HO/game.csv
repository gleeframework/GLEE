"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about $175? That gives you a good price, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $150.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",150.0,Bob,4,
