"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $750000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $850000 is a bit steep. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I am prepared to offer $800000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,4,
