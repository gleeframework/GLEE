"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is my absolute maximum. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,6,
