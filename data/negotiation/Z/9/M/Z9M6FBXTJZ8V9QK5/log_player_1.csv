Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum price.
* **Strong but Encouraging Message:** The message highlights the product's value to both you and Bob, making it more enticing."
