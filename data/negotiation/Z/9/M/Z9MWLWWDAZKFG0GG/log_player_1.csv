Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting closer to a price that's still very profitable for us.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning the offer is exclusive and time-limited (before offering to John), we incentivize Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing the potential profit."
