"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant importance to me, reflecting its true worth of $15,000. However, considering your unique appreciation for this item, I am extending an exclusive offer to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This represents a substantial saving for you while allowing me to maintain a fair return on my investment. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. By rejecting her initial offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. There's a chance she'll be more willing to negotiate if she knows you have another option."
