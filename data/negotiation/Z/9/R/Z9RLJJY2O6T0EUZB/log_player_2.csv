"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're confident it will meet all your needs. Let's make this a win-win situation. Would you consider purchasing it for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's within your budget, you can likely get a better price by negotiating. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $95 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, reflecting its value to me and your desired profit margin.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay more than its perceived value. Considering our business goals and aiming to maintain a positive relationship, I would like to offer you the product for $90. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still not within your ideal price range. You want to pay as close to $80 as possible to maximize your savings. Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate will hopefully get you a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully, and I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. I am willing to sell the product for $88. This price reflects the product's value while allowing us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is now within your acceptable range. You're looking to pay as close to $80 as possible, and while $88 is not the ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to John's $100 offer.  Further negotiation might get you a better price, but you risk losing the deal with Alice altogether or running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you from potentially wasting more time."
