"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in acquiring the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly higher than your valuation and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration of your offer, I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To find a mutually beneficial solution, I propose the following counteroffer: the product price will be set at $1,100,000. This price reflects a compromise between our initial valuations, while still allowing you to acquire a high-quality product that will likely provide significant returns for your business. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you, and I look forward to your response.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and allows us to reach an agreement that is fair to both parties. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
