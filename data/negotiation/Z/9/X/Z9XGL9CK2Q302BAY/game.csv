"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a great starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but  $850,000 is still pushing it for me.  My final offer is $750,000. If you can't do that, I'll have to consider my other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
