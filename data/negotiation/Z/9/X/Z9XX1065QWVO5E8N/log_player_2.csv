"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $15000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a great price for something this valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I think $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for the product.
