Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high. He can try to get a better price from Alice or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He can still try to negotiate further or buy from John for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I can realistically spend.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and $900,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob could try to push for a lower price, Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to his budget.  At this point, accepting the offer and saving time and effort is likely the best choice.  He's still getting the product for less than John's price and has successfully negotiated a lower price."
