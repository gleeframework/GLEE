"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I can realistically spend.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and $900,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,5,
