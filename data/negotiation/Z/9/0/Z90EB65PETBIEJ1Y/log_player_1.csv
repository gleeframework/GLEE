Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but still allows me to make a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging in my message, highlighting the value the product holds for Bob.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower price than my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to initiate a negotiation that ultimately benefits both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then make a counteroffer or simply sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's close to what the product is worth to him, it's not a good deal for me.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him.  He's already shown interest in the product, so there's potential for a counteroffer that's more in line with my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This price allows for a substantial profit for me while being significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's efforts to negotiate a good price while maintaining my position that $850,000 is not acceptable. I'm also emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome, which encourages him to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move. By offering a price closer to Bob's counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still maintaining a significant profit margin, which is crucial for my goals. This approach aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I can realistically spend.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still a significant discount. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. This shows Bob that I'm committed to getting a better price, and it might motivate him to make a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and $900,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This price is still within my acceptable range, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and emphasizing the compromise I'm making. I'm also appealing to his sense of fairness by highlighting the product's value.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and that he'll be willing to close the deal at this price. If he rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to avoid that as a last resort."
