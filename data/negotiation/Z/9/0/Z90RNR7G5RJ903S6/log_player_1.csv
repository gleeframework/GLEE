Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My floor:** I'm willing to sell for at least $15,000 to John, so that's my minimum.
* **Bob's ceiling:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a range of $7,000 between our values.  
* **Initial offer:** By offering $12,000, I'm starting in the middle of that range, leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **Risk mitigation:** While I could start higher, I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always go back to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Counteroffer:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. 
* **Risk:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I risk that he might walk away altogether. However, the potential reward of getting closer to my desired price justifies this risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My goal:** I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob offered $9,000, which is too low.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. 
* **Flexibility:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Risk:** There's a risk that Bob might reject this offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise and worth taking to try and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  At this point, Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price. Further negotiation would likely lead to a stalemate or a lower price.
* **Risk:** By selling to John, I eliminate the risk of Bob walking away or continuing to negotiate for a lower price.

**Conclusion:**  It's more profitable and less risky to sell the product to John at this point."
