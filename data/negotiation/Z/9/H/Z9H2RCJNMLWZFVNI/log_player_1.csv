{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn a profit beyond our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its value to him ($800,000 vs. $1,100,000).
    * We earn $100,000 more than our minimum acceptable price ($1,100,000 vs. $1,000,000).
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By approaching Bob first, we leverage the potential for a quicker sale and avoid any complications that might arise from dealing with multiple buyers. 

This offer balances our desire for maximum profit with a price that is likely attractive to Bob, increasing our chances of a successful sale."
