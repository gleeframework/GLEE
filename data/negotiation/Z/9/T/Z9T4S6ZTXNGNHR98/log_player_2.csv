"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  I'm willing to negotiate, and I'm not desperate to buy immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm happy to consider your product, but I'd like to start at $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying but am willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for us to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to start lower, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price, but $11,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I have a few rounds left and John is a reliable alternative.  I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get even closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me right now. I'm ready to make a deal at $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still giving me a good value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to inch closer to my target price.  $10,500 is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm committed to finding a solution but still have room to negotiate. I'm confident that this offer will be more attractive to Alice, as it brings us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting this deal done, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is a fair price that balances our interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,750, which is tempting. However, I still have a few rounds left and I'm confident that I can secure a lower price. John's offer of $10,000 remains a viable alternative, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly higher than that. I'll make a counteroffer and see if I can push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $10,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's just a little lower than Alice's offer, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to go any higher. By pushing a little further, I'm hoping to secure the product at a price that's as close to my target as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting close to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is just $50 more than your last offer. I'm not going to go any higher than that, so this is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $10,500.  While this is closer to my target price, it is still $500 higher than my maximum budget.  I have a reliable alternative with John who is willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm confident that this is the best deal available to me, and I don't want to risk spending more than I need to."
