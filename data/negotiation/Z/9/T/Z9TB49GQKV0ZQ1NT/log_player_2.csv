# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is also a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, so I'm counteroffering at $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,750.  Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
