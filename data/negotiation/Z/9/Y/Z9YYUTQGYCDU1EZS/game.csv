"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1200000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous offers. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is still a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $980000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous offers and the value of the product. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I may need to consider buying from John for $800000.

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is still a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I will indeed sell the product to John for $1500000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
