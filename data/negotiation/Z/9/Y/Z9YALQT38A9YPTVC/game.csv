Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that can bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is no less than $1200000.,800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1200000.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $700000 is still above what I can justify at this point.  I'm willing to offer $650000. This is a significant step towards your last offer and a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $675000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1200000.",675000.0,Alice,5,
