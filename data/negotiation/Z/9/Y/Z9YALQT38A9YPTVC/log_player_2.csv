"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that can bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is no less than $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. There's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:**  I'm aiming for a large discount from Alice's initial offer, showing I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Fairness:** My counteroffer is still within my budget, suggesting I'm not just trying to lowball her. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for my counteroffer (value I see in the product) makes it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still above what I can justify at this point.  I'm willing to offer $650,000. This is a significant step towards your last offer and a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I point out the fact that my offer is a ""significant step"" towards Alice's last offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $675000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. At $675,000, her offer is getting close to the price I would be willing to pay for the product from John.  While I'd like to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal.  I'll accept this offer and secure the product."
