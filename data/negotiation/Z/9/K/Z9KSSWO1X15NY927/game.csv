"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget.  While I recognize the product's unique value, I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1400000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is my final counteroffer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
