"Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $120? That's still a good price for you and within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm hoping for.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite there yet.  $130 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $125? That's a fair compromise and keeps the deal moving forward.",125.0,Bob,4,
