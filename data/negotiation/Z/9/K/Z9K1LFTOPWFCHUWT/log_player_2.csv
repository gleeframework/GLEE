"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($100).  There's room for negotiation, and it's always better to try to get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $120? That's still a good price for you and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm hoping for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still higher than my desired price point. I'm still within the negotiation window with 7 rounds remaining. I want to see if I can push for a lower price closer to my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite there yet.  $130 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $125? That's a fair compromise and keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 125}
