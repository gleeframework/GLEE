I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob.  I'm not sure what his top limit is, but I can at least try to squeeze out another $50,000."

I'm going to try to meet Bob in the middle. This is a pretty risky move, as if Bob rejects this offer, I'm likely going to have to sell to John. But I'm hoping that he's willing to split the difference this time."

It's getting close to John's price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer.  Time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
