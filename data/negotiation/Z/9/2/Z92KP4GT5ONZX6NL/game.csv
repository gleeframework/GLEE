"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too high for me. I could go up to $950,000. That's a significant investment, and I'm serious about making this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
