"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within your budget.  This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating and gives her room to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to you.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it below your maximum price. This should hopefully make Alice more willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than what the product is worth to you. With only 5 rounds left, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit more to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

Since we're down to the last few rounds and Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, I'm going to make a final counteroffer at your maximum value.  This is a fair price for both of us and hopefully gets the deal done."
