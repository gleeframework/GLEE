"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1750000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1200000 for your product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to the value I'm looking for.  How about $1600000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this valuable product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm proposing $1450000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
