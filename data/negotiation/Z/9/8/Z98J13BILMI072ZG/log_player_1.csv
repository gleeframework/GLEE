Round 2

Round 3

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aware of the value this product holds for him and is trying to lowball us.  We've made concessions, but he's not moving much. We're still significantly above our minimum, and we have time to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to be upfront.  While I'm still open to negotiating, I do have another interested buyer.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not feeling the pressure, and I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500, which is $11,750. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally moving closer to a reasonable price, and his offer of $11,750 is a decent compromise. While we could potentially push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's also a risk that he walks away or we waste time we could be using to close a deal with John if negotiations sour.  Taking this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of having to settle for John's $8,000 offer later."
