"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its value, I'm offering it for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more than that, but I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $12,000 is a tempting offer, the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. However,  $11,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $12,500? This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to be upfront.  While I'm still open to negotiating, I do have another interested buyer. My offer of $12,500 stands for now, but I can't guarantee it will last.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not feeling the pressure, and I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500, which is $11,750. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11750.0,Bob,8,
