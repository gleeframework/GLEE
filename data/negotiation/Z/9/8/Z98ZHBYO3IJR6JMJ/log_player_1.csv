"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has immense value for someone like you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows for room to negotiate and also conveys the product's value. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's potential benefits for Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I've left the door open for Bob to counter-offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I am looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, and I'm not in a rush to settle.  
* **Negotiation:** There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Potential Gain:** By rejecting, I can explore if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,750,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-point:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, making it more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages a deal.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, but the counteroffer shows that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **John as a Backup:**  As always, selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to counter with a price of $1600000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your range and we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $100,000 less than my initial counteroffer of $1,750,000.  I'm getting closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  $1,600,000 is a good price considering the potential for further rejection.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, it's important to close the deal if possible.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is my minimum, I'm not guaranteed to get a better price from Bob.  This is a good opportunity to secure a profitable sale."
