"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
