Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, his offer is unlikely to reach the $1,500,000 mark that John is readily offering. It makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed sale with John."
