Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
