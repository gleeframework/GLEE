Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. My initial offer is $100 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.,100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $85. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While the product is good, $85 is still a little too steep for me.  Could you do $70? That would be a great price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $78. It's a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair deal.",78.0,Alice,5,
