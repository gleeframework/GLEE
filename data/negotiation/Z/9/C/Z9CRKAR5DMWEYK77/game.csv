"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  $13500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14250?  That way, we both get a good deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
