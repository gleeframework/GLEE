Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a starting price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price favorable to you.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $18,000, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he knows it's worth less to him, the initial high price might make him more amenable to a counteroffer that's still above his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The significant difference between your asking price and Bob's perceived value leaves ample room for negotiation. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your offers accordingly.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net. You can confidently negotiate with Bob, knowing you have a backup plan if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's price, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. Accepting $12,000 immediately leaves money on the table. By rejecting and countering, we can:

1. **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  See if he's willing to move closer to our desired price range.
2. **Maintain Negotiating Position:**  Accepting his first offer might signal we're desperate to sell.

We'll craft a counteroffer that's still above our minimum but shows some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see the value."", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:**  The $2,000 reduction shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counter. We're still well above our $12,000 minimum and John's offer. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth, subtly nudging Bob away from his lower valuation.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** This counteroffer still leaves space for Bob to propose a higher price than his initial $12,000, while keeping us in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum and John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is a good compromise. It's $2,000 above our minimum selling price and $2,000 above John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could counter again, the potential gains are getting smaller.  Each round takes time, and there's a risk Bob might walk away.
* **Bob's Interest:** His message suggests he's motivated to buy. Accepting now avoids the chance of him finding an alternative or changing his mind. 

By accepting $14,000, we secure a profit and avoid the uncertainties of further negotiation."
