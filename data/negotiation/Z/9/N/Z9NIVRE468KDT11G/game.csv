"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see the value.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
