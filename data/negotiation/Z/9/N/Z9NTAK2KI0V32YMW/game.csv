"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. It's a great price, considering the value it brings to the table.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the $800,000 mark.  It's still a good deal for you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $950,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $925,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $975,000? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
