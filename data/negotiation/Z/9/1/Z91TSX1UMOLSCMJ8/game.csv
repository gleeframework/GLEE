"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1075000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1062500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1062500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1087500. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
