"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1100000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $1000000 to you.  Let's start the negotiation off strong! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum value. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price.  He should reject the offer and see if he can get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1075000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us both to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He's willing to go up a bit, but he's not quite there yet. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price in the next round before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,075,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,062,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1062500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1087500. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. With only a few rounds left, the potential for a significantly better offer from Alice is diminishing.  It's now more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a lower price and avoiding further negotiation with Alice."
