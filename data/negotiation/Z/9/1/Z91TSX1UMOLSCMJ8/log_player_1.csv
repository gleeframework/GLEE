Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I still have 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if I need to."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1075000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1062500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,062,500 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I have 6 rounds left before I need to make a decision, and I'm not going to sell to John unless I absolutely have to."
