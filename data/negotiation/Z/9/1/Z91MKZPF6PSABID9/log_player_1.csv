Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $950,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with $990,000.  I'm confident I can push for a better deal, especially with John's offer as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $990,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,020,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,020,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's getting very close to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'm confident that I can push for a bit more, especially with John's offer as a safety net."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $995,000 is still slightly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1,005,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $995,000, as I mentioned before. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I don't think the product is worth that much to me. I'm sticking to my original limit. Can you meet me at $995,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Although I'm not thrilled about settling for less than I originally hoped, it's clear that Bob is not willing to go higher than $995,000.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob in the next round."
