Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows for potential profit beyond our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price of $1,450,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
    * Slightly below John's offer, creating a sense of urgency and a favorable comparison for Bob.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a ""fair deal"" rather than a hard bargain.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a high chance of closing the deal."
