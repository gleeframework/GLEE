Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the value to you (Alice), the message hints at the product's worth by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly suggests to Bob that the price isn't arbitrary.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially negotiate.

By offering the product at $10,000, Alice gives herself a chance to potentially earn more than her minimum while still having the security of John's offer as a backup."
