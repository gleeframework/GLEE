"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and acknowledging your need for a fair return. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers substantial value, and I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
