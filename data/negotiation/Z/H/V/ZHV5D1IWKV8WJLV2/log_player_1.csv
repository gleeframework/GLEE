Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and acknowledging your need for a fair return. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
