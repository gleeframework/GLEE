"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm happy to pay $9,000, which would still represent a good profit for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,200, which is still a great deal considering the value it will bring to your life and business. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9200.0,Alice,3,
