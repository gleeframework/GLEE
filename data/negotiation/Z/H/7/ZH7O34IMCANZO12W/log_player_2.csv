"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum budget. You want to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still above your desired price point.  It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if you can get her down to your target price of $105 or even a bit lower.  You have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to work out a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $108.  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $108 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $112. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is within your budget and a reasonable compromise.  You've already rejected a few offers, and it's getting closer to your target price.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product while still saving some money compared to buying from John."
