Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $170 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with a higher offer than his valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your desired minimum.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer of $170 is safely above your $150 minimum while still being significantly below John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leaving Room:** There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you space to potentially go lower while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could experiment with different starting prices and messages.  The key is to balance maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
