"I understand the value of the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
