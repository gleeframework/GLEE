"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and provides a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $9,500. This price is still a good deal for me, considering its value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
