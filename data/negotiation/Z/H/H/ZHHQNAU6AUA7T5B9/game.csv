"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. Let's aim for a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would give you a good profit while staying within my limits.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9,500. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which would be $10,750. This is the best I can do at this point. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,000. This is a fair price considering we're both getting closer to our target numbers.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is closer to my minimum price and still a good deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  That's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  This is a good deal for both of us, as we are both getting closer to our desired price. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is the next best compromise. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,9,
