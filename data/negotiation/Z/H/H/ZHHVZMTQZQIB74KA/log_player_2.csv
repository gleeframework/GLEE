{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay. There's room for negotiation, and you should aim for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're offering a price of $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120. This is a strong counteroffer that shows you're serious about buying the product but are looking for a fair deal. It's still within your budget and leaves room for potential negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than what you'd like to pay. While it's getting closer to your desired price, you should still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue bargaining with Alice, potentially reaching a price closer to your $100 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

You're offering a price of $110, which is a compromise between your previous counteroffer of $100 and Alice's latest offer of $130. This demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to your target. It's important to keep the bargaining process moving forward while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is still higher than your initial goal, it's getting close to your budget limit. You've already made several counteroffers and it's possible Alice is unlikely to go lower.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price that's still within your budget,  rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
