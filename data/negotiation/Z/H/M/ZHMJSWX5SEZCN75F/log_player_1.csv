"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust accordingly in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I can likely do better than that. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $125, which is above my minimum and a decent profit.  I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and risk losing him as a buyer."
