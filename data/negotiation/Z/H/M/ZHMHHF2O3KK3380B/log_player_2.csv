"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000.
* Alice is offering it for $14,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, you can get the product from John for $15,000, which means you have room to negotiate further with Alice. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get a lower price from her or buy from John if she doesn't come down."
