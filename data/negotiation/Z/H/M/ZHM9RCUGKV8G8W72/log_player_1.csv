Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm looking for a price around $22,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $22,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. $18,000 is still a bit steep for me though.  Could you do $12,000? I think that's a fair price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for being so clear about your position.  While $16,000 is still a bit more than I wanted to spend, I can tell this product is valuable.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $13,000.  Hopefully, we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark. Accepting his current offer means a $2,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
