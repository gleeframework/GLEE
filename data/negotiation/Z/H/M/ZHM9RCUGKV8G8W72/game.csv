"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm looking for a price around $22,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $22,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. $18,000 is still a bit steep for me though.  Could you do $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can't do $12,000, but I am willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer, as I think it's a very fair price considering the value this product offers. ",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being so clear about your position.  While $16,000 is still a bit more than I wanted to spend, I can tell this product is valuable.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $13,000.  Hopefully, we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
