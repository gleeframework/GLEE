"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,015,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us to both walk away happy. ",1015000.0,Alice,5,
