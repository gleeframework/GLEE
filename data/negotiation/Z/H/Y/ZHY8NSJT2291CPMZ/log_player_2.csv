"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I propose we find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be interested in discussing a price that could make this transaction appealing for both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation, or you can buy directly from John."
