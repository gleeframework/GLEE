"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product, given that's my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $80 is too low for me, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120?  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $80.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm confident that I can get a better price than $80. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs while still giving you a great deal on a great product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $100 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking to my original offer of $80. It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stuck at $80 and won't budge. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $100.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than taking $80."
