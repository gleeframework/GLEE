"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product, given that's my maximum budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120?  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $80.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs while still giving you a great deal on a great product.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $100 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking to my original offer of $80. It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",80.0,Bob,6,
