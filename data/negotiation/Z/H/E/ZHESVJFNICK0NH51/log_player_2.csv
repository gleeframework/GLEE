"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to potentially get an even better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is still a good deal for him, saving him $1,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge again, and he risks losing the deal altogether."
