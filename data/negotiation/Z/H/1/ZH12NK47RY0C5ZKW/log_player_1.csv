Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at Bob's value ($1,000,000) would be leaving money on the table. Offering it at your value ($1,200,000) or higher is very likely to make Bob reject the offer. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  The price of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. This approach aims to make the offer attractive to Bob while maximizing your potential earnings."
