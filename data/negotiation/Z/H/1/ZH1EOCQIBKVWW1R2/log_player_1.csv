Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer positively, highlighting the deal's attractiveness for Bob.  This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  I'm not starting at my ideal price of $15,000 right away, as this might make Bob immediately walk away.  By starting with a lower price, I'm more likely to secure a deal while still leaving room to negotiate upwards. I'm also keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, considering his willingness to make a ""serious offer."" 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a price closer to my ideal. I'm not in a rush to sell, as I have John as a backup buyer.  This gives me the leverage to hold out for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's effort and continue to frame the offer as mutually beneficial. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative negotiation tone.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and remaining open to negotiation. 
* By offering a compromise, I demonstrate flexibility, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting or at least making a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob is unwilling to budge significantly, as I have John as an alternative buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. This is my final offer, I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, considering his statement that he's not sure he can go any lower. This suggests that he may be willing to budge a little more.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a price closer to my ideal.  I'm not in a rush to sell, as I have John as a backup buyer.  This gives me the leverage to hold out for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation and appreciate your final offer. While I'm willing to meet you halfway again, $9,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try $10,000 as a final compromise.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if this is something you can work with. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,750. This continues to demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Message:** I reiterate Bob's statement about his ""final offer"" and frame my counteroffer as a ""final compromise."" This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously.  I also reiterate my confidence in the value of the product, hoping to sway Bob's decision.

**Strategy:**

* I'm pushing for a price closer to my desired range while acknowledging Bob's limitations.
* By framing my offer as a ""final compromise,"" I increase the pressure on Bob to accept.
*  I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob is unwilling to budge significantly, as I have John as an alternative buyer."
