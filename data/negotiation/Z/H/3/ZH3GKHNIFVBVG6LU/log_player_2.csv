"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room to negotiate further, and there are still 9 rounds left to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his ideal price of $8,000 as possible. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, showing Alice he's serious about buying but still leaving room for negotiation. This also allows him to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob has a better chance to get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  There are still 7 rounds left, and with each round, Alice might be more willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice has shown a willingness to come down from her initial price. By offering $9,500, Bob is demonstrating he's serious about a deal while still leaving room for Alice to lower her price further. This counteroffer also keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, and he is getting closer to reaching his target.  He has 5 rounds left and a strong chance to negotiate a better price, as Alice has already shown willingness to compromise. Continuing the negotiation will likely lead to a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistently trying to lower the price. By offering $10,000, Bob is demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below his maximum.  This counteroffer is strategically positioned to push Alice closer to her desired price point, potentially leading to a successful deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is slightly lower than her previous one, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. He has 3 rounds remaining and has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, especially as Alice has shown signs of flexibility in her pricing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, he is still offering a price lower than Alice's last offer, pushing her to accept closer to his desired price point. This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency for Alice, as only two rounds remain. If Alice rejects again, Bob has a strong argument to move to John's offer in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, it is unlikely that Alice will come down to a price that Bob is willing to accept. She has rejected all of his counteroffers in the last few rounds, and it is unlikely that she will change her mind with just one round left.

Buying from John at $12,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it guarantees him the product without risking further negotiation. While it's not his ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise given the limited time and Alice's unwillingness to budge."
