Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** A counteroffer of $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a polite and friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive and avoids alienating Alice.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $110 is within your budget and represents a good compromise from the initial price of $120. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk is that Alice might reject your next offer.
* **Time constraint:**  You only have 10 rounds, so accepting a reasonable offer early is a good strategy."
