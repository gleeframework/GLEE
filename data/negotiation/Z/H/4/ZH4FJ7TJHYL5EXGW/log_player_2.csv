"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential benefits for you, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate downwards towards our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks valuable, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us more room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite & Reasonable:** The message is framed positively, acknowledging the product's value while explaining our budget constraints. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** Our goal is to buy for much less than $15,000. Offering $10,000 gives us a decent starting point to potentially secure a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a significant undervaluation of what this product can do for you. I could be flexible and meet you halfway - how about $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can likely do better. We started quite low to give ourselves room, so we should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"", 
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are showing Alice that we are willing to move upward, but in a controlled way. 
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** $10,750 is a significant savings from her offer and a price that would likely be a very good deal for us.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We don't want to accept too quickly and give away potential bargaining power. There's still a chance Alice might go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to accept $11,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** While Alice might not strictly stick to this, it's unlikely she'll move much lower, especially since it's already a decent drop.
* **Good Value:** $11,000 is a solid price, saving us $4,000 from John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a small price decrease risks Alice backing out altogether.  It's safer to secure the deal now at a good price."
