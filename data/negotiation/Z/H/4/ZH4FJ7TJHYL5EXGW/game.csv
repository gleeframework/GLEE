"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks valuable, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a significant undervaluation of what this product can do for you. I could be flexible and meet you halfway - how about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to accept $11,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive.",11000.0,Alice,5,
