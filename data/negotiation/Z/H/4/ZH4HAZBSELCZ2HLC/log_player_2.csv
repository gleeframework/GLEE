# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right away."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be a bit closer to $115 to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $110 is better than $115, you're still above your target price of $120. You should try to negotiate further to see if you can get the price down even more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and am willing to go up to $108. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $109.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. You're close to your target price of $120 and it's likely that you won't be able to get a better price with further negotiation.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
