Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, as it's 50% more than my minimum acceptable price.  It allows room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I believe it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring a higher profit than selling to John. I'm hoping this will be a compelling enough offer to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still lower than I would like, it's a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a deadlock, and I'm confident that selling to Bob at this price is a better option than selling to John or potentially losing the deal altogether."
