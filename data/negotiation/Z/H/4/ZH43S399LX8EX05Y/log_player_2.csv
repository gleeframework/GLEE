"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Even though Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, Alice's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower, saving Bob $2,500.
* **John's offer is not competitive:**  John's price of $12,000 would exhaust Bob's entire budget, leaving no room for savings.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision to maximize Bob's savings."
