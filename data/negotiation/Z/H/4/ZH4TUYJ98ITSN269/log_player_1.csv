Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also far below my initial offer of $100, indicating that he is not willing to negotiate seriously.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $80 is my absolute minimum. Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
