"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product and what his budget might be. I'm also aware that I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I need to see if he's willing to come up closer to my desired range.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000, which is still above my minimum of $1,500,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I hope to find a middle ground with Bob while still getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a much better price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it shows my commitment to reaching a deal with Bob. I'm hoping he will see the value in my product and come closer to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a price that reflects the value of my product. I've already made significant concessions, but he continues to offer drastically low prices.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get more, securing $1,500,000 is still a good outcome."
