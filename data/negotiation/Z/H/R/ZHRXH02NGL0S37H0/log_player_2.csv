"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I believe in its value and think it would be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down on the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than our actual budget ($8,000) to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. This tactic might encourage Alice to also move significantly from her initial high offer.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is respectful of Alice's time while clearly stating our price limit. This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving without offending the seller. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By saying ""closer to $6,000,"" we signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $12,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved from her initial price, $12,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she might be open to further price reductions.

Let's continue the negotiation and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** This counteroffer presents Alice with your maximum budget. This is a strategic move, as it signals your firm limit while still leaving a small margin for a final compromise (e.g., $8,500) if Alice is absolutely unwilling to go this low.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:** By suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" you emphasize fairness and a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.  
* **Direct and Respectful:**  The message remains concise and avoids haggling tactics, which helps maintain a positive tone in the negotiation."
