"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $6,000. This considers my budget and still gives you a good return.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $9,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500?  It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go up to $7,500, but I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price. I'm offering the product for $8,500. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $8,000 to close this deal. This is my final offer, as I know I can buy it for that from someone else. Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $8,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product for $8,800. This is my final offer, as I know I can sell it to John for $10,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",8800.0,Alice,7,
