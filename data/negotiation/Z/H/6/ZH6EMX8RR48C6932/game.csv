"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Its value is undeniable, and I believe it will be transformative for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price, so I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to move closer to your number to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair offer for such a valuable asset.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm confident that this product will be valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. Can you consider that?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer. I value your willingness to negotiate and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we agree on $1,100,000? This reflects a significant price reduction on my end while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,6,
