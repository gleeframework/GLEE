"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's finalize this! ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I am unable to agree to $1,300,000. I would like to counter with $1,250,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you, while also being within my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's make this final offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows me to meet your budget. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
