Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I'm hoping to find a price point that aligns better with my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your desire to work within your budget, however, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Could we settle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Bob is at your minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches the amount John is willing to pay. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and you risk him walking away entirely.
* **Time value of money:** Closing the deal now means you get the money sooner, which is always preferable in business."
