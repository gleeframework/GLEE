"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $650,000.  Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident this would be a win-win.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $725,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $725,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle at $825,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on your end but ensures you acquire a truly valuable asset.",825000.0,Alice,5,
