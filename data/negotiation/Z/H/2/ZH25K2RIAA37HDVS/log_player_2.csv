Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $650,000.  Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident this would be a win-win. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $725,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $725,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle at $825,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on your end but ensures you acquire a truly valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very slowly coming down on price and is still trying to get more than your maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go below $800,000 in the remaining rounds.  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John."
