"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $825000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, but still above his ideal price. Since Bob has 10 rounds, there's room to keep negotiating and potentially reach a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring lower options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. If that works for you, we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $825000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $850,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of reaching a stalemate or Alice walking away. Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees Bob the product at his maximum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
