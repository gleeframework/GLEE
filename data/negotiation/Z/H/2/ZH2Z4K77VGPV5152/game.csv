"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $825000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum. If that works for you, we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $825000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is my final compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
