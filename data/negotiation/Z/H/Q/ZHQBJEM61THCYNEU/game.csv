"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit beyond what I can afford right now.  Let's try $1,150,000. This feels like a fair price, considering your minimum, and it gives me a bit of room to work with.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $1,350,000, which is still a bit below my target, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $1,250,000? That leaves us both with some room to make a deal that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $1,400,000, which is still a bit below my target, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,9,
