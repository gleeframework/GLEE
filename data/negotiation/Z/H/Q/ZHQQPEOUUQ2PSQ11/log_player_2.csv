Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,200,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $1,200,000.  This is the same price John is offering. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, hoping for a lower price, when you can secure the product from John for the same amount right now."
