"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to his own valuation ($100) and a fair compromise for Alice (who values the product at $80).  Offering $85 leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92 is still within Bob's acceptable range of $100. While it's not the best price, it's better than buying from John for $100. It's also a good indication that Alice is willing to negotiate and there might not be much further room for lowering the price."
