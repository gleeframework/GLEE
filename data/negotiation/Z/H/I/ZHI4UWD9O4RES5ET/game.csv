"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget for this is a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about if I offer the product at $135? This still gives us some room for negotiation while ensuring I receive a fair price for the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $130. If that works for you, I'm ready to make the purchase.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering the value of the product and your previous offer, I believe we can reach an agreement. How about if I offer the product at $128? It's a slight compromise that I hope will work for both of us.",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $128 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $125.  Let's see if we can find a way to bridge that small gap.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. How about if I offer the product at $126? This is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",126.0,Alice,7,
