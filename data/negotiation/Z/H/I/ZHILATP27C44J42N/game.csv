"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
