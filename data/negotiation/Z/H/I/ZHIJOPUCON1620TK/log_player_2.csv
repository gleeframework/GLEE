* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
* **Your Maximum:** $15,000
* **John's Price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
