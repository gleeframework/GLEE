"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's a good compromise that gives us both a fair deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000,  which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $9,000 is a fair offer. I'm willing to make one last concession to see if we can reach a deal. I'll accept $9,500 for the product.  It's a small difference, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
