{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This gives me a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  It's also a price that is still attractive to Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to give in that easily.  There's still room to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 88}
