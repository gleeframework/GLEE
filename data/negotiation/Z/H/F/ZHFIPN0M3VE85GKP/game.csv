,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay the full $10,000. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit of money.",9500.0,Bob,4,
