Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and still land within a range that is highly profitable for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $10,000 immediately signals you might be willing to go much lower.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob."
