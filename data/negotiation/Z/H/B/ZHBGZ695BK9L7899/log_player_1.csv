"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so we start significantly above your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high initial offer gives us space to negotiate down while still aiming for a final price well above your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer helps gauge how interested Bob is and provides insight into his potential counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low. It's clear he's trying to anchor the negotiation extremely low. We have plenty of room to negotiate upwards and shouldn't settle for such a small fraction of the product's value to you. We'll counter in the next round and try to steer the price closer to a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Still Strong:** We significantly decrease our asking price from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000 to show willingness to negotiate, but we remain well above both Bob's offer and your minimum price.
* **Justification:** We're emphasizing the product's value to justify the high price and discourage Bob from anchoring too low. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge how much Bob is willing to move from his initial lowball offer. We can then adjust our strategy in the following rounds accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, and I am serious about purchasing it. To demonstrate that, I'm increasing my offer to $700,000. This is a substantial jump and reflects my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still far below both your minimum and a reasonable price for the product.  He's moving in the right direction, but it's too slow.  We need to signal that larger jumps are necessary to continue the negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob and shows you're serious about a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price point. However, we still have a considerable gap to bridge. To show I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, I'll come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a more substantial concession this round, dropping $300,000, to incentivize Bob to significantly increase his offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  Even with the decrease, our offer remains well above Bob's current price and your $1,500,000 minimum, preserving room for further negotiation. 
* **Shifting Expectations:** By making a more significant move, we aim to shift Bob's expectations and encourage him to make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the current price point is still not feasible for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer.  I need to see significant movement towards my budget, otherwise, I'll need to consider other options for this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is barely moving, and he's now introduced an ultimatum. This signals that he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), it's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiating with Bob. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.  It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal with John."
