"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9500. I'd like to propose a compromise: how about $8800? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $8800 is closer, I'm still unable to go lower than $9000. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to bridge this gap.",9000.0,Alice,5,
