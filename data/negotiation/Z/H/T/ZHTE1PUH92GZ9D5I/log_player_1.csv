Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be very profitable for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **High:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Reasonable:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation. 

By leaving room for negotiation, you encourage Bob to counter-offer, giving you the chance to potentially earn even more.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below the $1,400,000 you initially offered.  You can potentially get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer. You also have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you are willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your previous offer:** This demonstrates your flexibility and willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **It's still above your minimum acceptable price:**  You are still in a good position to get a good price for the product. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,250,000, which is getting very close to your initial counteroffer of $1,300,000. At this point, it's better to secure the deal and take the profit.  You are still earning significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  There is always a risk that you could continue negotiating and end up with a lower price, or that Bob might walk away."
