"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
