"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you, Bob! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have an alternative option with John for $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
