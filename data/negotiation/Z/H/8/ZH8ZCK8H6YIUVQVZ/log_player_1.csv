"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, even though I know his valuation is lower.  This framing can potentially shift his perception. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to discussing the price further, making it more likely Bob will engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $60 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($120) and my initial offer. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. Rejecting this offer opens the door for me to counter and move towards a more agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:** I'm aware I can sell to John for my minimum, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob. I'll leverage John as a safety net while I negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but I can't sell it for such a low price. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Lowball:** By firmly but politely stating that $60 is too low, I'm setting a boundary and discouraging further lowball offers.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  While $110 is still a significant drop from my initial price, it's closer to my minimum and might be perceived as a compromise by Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps me understand how serious Bob is about the purchase and how flexible he's willing to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer. How about we split the difference from your last proposal and settle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer of $85 is better than his previous one, it remains significantly below my minimum of $120.
* **Slow Progress:**  Bob's counteroffers are moving in the right direction, but very slowly.  I need to encourage him to increase his offer more substantially.
* **John Option Remains:** I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John for $120, so I have leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this. To make this a worthwhile deal for me, I'd need to get at least $100.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I want to keep the negotiation positive and acknowledge that we are making some progress towards a deal.
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating my minimum price more explicitly, I'm setting a clear boundary for Bob while still offering a price that's a significant discount from my initial offer.
* **Seeking Closure:**  I'm getting closer to the point where continuing to negotiate with Bob might not be worth the potential gains.  This offer puts the ball in Bob's court and encourages him to make a serious move if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $90 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress, Limited Potential:** Bob's offer is incrementally increasing, but very slowly. Even if he were to match my $100 asking price, it's a relatively small gain compared to John's guaranteed $120.
* **Time Cost:**  We've spent six rounds negotiating, and while progress has been made, it's been slow.  Continuing to haggle with Bob for a potentially small increase isn't the best use of my time. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John represents a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.  This certainty outweighs the risk of continuing with Bob and potentially getting a slightly better deal, or reaching a stalemate and losing both opportunities."
