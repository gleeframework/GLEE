Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to both of us, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's better to try to push for a higher price.  Bob is clearly trying to lowball.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $1,250,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
