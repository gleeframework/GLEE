Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80)
* **Starting high but reasonable:** $100 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlighting value to Bob:** Emphasizing Bob's perceived value aims to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving the door open for negotiation:** The open-ended question invites Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
