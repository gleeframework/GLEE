"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range for you. It signals that you are serious about buying the product but are also prepared to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While it's closer to your target price, it's still worth seeing if you can get a lower price.  There's a good chance that Alice is willing to negotiate further since she already adjusted her price from the previous round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, showing Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are also firm on your price limit.  You are still within your budget, and $10,500 might be a good compromise point for Alice as she has already reduced her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10750. It's a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within your budget, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. Since you have more rounds left and you're getting closer to your target price, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,750. Would you consider $10,250? I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our desire to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is another small step towards your target price. You are showing Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are also firm on your price limit.  It's a reasonable compromise given the previous rounds and may convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is now within your budget, and it's a good compromise.  You have only 3 rounds left, and the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and running out of time is high. It's better to secure the product now at a price that is close to your target price."
