"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This is to leave room for negotiation while still establishing a firm starting point.  It's also important to keep in mind that I can always switch to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want. I have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer.  It shows flexibility while still demonstrating that I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. It's still too far below my minimum price. While John is a safe bet at $1,200,000, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. There's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to go no lower than this.  I believe Bob might be willing to accept this as he's already shown a willingness to move closer to my desired price.  If he rejects this, I'll have to consider selling to John as I've already offered my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one! I've been trying to negotiate with Bob but he's not willing to go higher than $1,000,000.  That's significantly less than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  While I could keep negotiating, I've already reached my bottom line.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John. It's a safe bet and ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
