Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000 allows for potential negotiation and avoids a quick rejection from Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum than his initial value, $850,000 is still less than what I need to achieve my goal.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  I believe I can still get a higher price by countering Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $1,000,000 gives me leverage to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000. This price still leaves a good margin for you, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's constraints but not giving in completely. By offering $875,000, I'm showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a good deal for both of us, highlighting the value proposition for Bob.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging further negotiation, showing that I'm open to finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $860,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, the risk of further negotiation not leading to a better outcome is high.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to more rejected offers.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and ensures I get a substantial amount of money. 

While I'm slightly below my initial goal, it's a good outcome considering the potential for further negotiation to fail."
