"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There's room for both parties to find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can still potentially do better. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
