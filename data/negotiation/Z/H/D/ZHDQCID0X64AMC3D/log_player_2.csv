"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Could we potentially agree on a price closer to $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to negotiate further. Would you consider $1,075,000?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price and acknowledges your interest in a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that.  However, $975,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the returns you'll see from it. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,025,000. This offer represents my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above $1,000,000.  She's used language like ""final concession"" and ""absolute lowest price,"" signaling she's unlikely to budge much. It's not worth risking a higher counteroffer that she might accept when you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000 from John."
