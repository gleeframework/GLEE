"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Could we potentially agree on a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to negotiate further. Would you consider $1,075,000?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price and acknowledges your interest in a mutually beneficial deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that.  However, $975,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the returns you'll see from it. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,025,000. This offer represents my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
