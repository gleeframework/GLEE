Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's below your floor price:**  You're willing to accept $120 from John, so you're not giving it away.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can still potentially make a profit."
