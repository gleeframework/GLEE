Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $14,000. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our desired profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at our minimum acceptable price."
