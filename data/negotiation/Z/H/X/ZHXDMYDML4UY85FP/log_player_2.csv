"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible, since that's the value to Alice.
* **Reasonable offer:** A $500 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point. It shows Bob is serious about buying but is also negotiating. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone will keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8800. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:** $8,800 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $10,000 and the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. 
* **Meeting halfway:** Alice's offer shows a willingness to compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, he risks Alice getting frustrated and potentially walking away from the deal."
