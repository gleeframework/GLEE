"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's not a good deal for Bob to pay $12,000 when he values the product at $10,000. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a bit more reasonable for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his value, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to counteroffer at $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While Alice has come down to $10,800, that's still more than Bob is willing to pay. Since he has a guaranteed option to buy the product for his maximum value, he should take it."
