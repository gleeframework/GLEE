Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value, I'm asking for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll see. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price still well above your minimum.
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message highlights the product's value, justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have some time to negotiate with Bob and that an immediate sale isn't critical. If time is a factor, we might lower the asking price to increase the chance of a quick acceptance."
