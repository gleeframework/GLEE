Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,500,000. This product is truly unique, and it holds significant value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
