"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, so I'm thinking $9,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $9,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,400 as a final compromise. If you accept this offer, we can close the deal. However, if you reject it, I'll have to sell to another buyer for a higher price.",9400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $9,400 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm really hoping we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,8,
