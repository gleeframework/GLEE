"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low for me, especially considering I could sell to John for $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 with John. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, so I'm thinking $9,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still not as high as I'd like, and I'm concerned that I'm running out of rounds. I'm going to make a final counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John for $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $9,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,400 as a final compromise.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $9,400 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm really hoping we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. I've run out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm not comfortable with his final offer and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
