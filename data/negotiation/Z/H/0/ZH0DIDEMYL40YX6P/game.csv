"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and quality, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, $18,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. It offers tremendous value that I'm confident you'll benefit from. How about we meet halfway at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",19000.0,Bob,4,
