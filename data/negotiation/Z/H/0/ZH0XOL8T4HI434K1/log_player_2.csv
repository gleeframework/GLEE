"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $14,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's initial target, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob knows the product is worth less to Alice, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to try and bring the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,250 is getting very close to Bob's counteroffer of $14,000.  It's also significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice is not going to budge much more.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him money compared to buying from John."
