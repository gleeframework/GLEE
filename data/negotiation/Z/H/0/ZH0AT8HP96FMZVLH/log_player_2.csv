"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **It's a good compromise:**  Alice has lowered her price from $14,000, and Bob has increased his offer from $13,000.
* **It's likely the best possible deal:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's good for him, without risking a potential loss if the negotiation drags on."
