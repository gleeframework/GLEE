"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $700,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $850,000?  This price still leaves you a good margin for profit, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
