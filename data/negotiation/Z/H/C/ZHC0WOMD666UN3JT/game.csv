"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Let's try to bridge the gap and close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you're trying to meet me in the middle.  Unfortunately, $10,750 is still not enough for me to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250, which is a fair price given the product's value.  Let's try to come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
