"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's best to try to negotiate with Alice first. You're aiming for a price below $10,000, so rejecting the first offer and making a counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still aiming for a price below $10,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Let's try to bridge the gap and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate you're trying to meet me in the middle.  Unfortunately, $10,750 is still not enough for me to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250, which is a fair price given the product's value.  Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not budging much, and you're getting close to your limit. It's getting risky to keep negotiating, and the price is still above your desired target.  At this point, it's better to secure the product for a guaranteed price from John."
