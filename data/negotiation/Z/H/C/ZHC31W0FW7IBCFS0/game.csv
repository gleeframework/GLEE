"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great investment.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95.  I'm still a little hesitant to go that high, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $92.50? This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
