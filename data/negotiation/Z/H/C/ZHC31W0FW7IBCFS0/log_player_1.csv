"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Positive and Friendly:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to invite Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's a chance that with further negotiation, I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range, but still within the realm of possibility for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Incentive:**  I'm offering a compromise by dropping my price from $100 to $95. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and incentivizes Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product by saying it's a ""great investment."" This subtly reinforces the worth of the product and justifies my price. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Again, I'm ending with an open-ended question to keep the conversation flowing and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95.  I'm still a little hesitant to go that high, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  This feels like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Time on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to continue negotiating. Selling to John right now would mean giving up the opportunity to potentially earn a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range but still reasonable for Bob.  I might offer a price slightly lower than $95 to show my willingness to compromise but remain firm on my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $92.50? This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($90). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and makes it seem like a fair solution.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either accept his offer if it's close to my minimum, or I will continue to counteroffer in the next round, remaining flexible but also firm on my minimum acceptable price."
