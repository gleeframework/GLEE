"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
