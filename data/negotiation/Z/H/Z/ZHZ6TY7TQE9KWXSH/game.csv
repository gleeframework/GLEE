"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get a little closer to my target price. I'd be happy to pay $1100000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your seriousness about the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a little hesitant at $1300000. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I still think $1200000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,,
