It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice is offering a significant discount, but there's room for improvement.  Let's see if we can get closer to our desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your seriousness about the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high. Let's try to get a better deal with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I still think $1200000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is a good price considering the product's value to me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away or I might end up buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
