Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product, and I think it would be a great fit for you!  I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I'm offering it at a price that's higher than that, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob an incentive to buy, while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, and $125 is closer to what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $128?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 128} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise, and it's within my acceptable range. It's better than what I'd get from John, so I'll take it."
