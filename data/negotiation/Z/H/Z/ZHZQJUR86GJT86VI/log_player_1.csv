Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $12,000.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still a decent price. I'll think carefully about it.

I'll choose option 2: Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer.

I'll aim to increase the price slightly, but not too much, since Bob has already shown a willingness to buy at $10,000. I'll offer Bob $11,000.
