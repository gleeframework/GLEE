"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $105. This feels fair to both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $107.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However, $107.50 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $102.50, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $102.50 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $104. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",104.0,Alice,7,
