"I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product, which is a unique opportunity to own a high-value item. I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,100 for the product.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,100, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I think I can do better than that. Let me think for a moment...",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,150 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm hoping we can make this deal work.",9150.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,300. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit.",9300.0,Alice,9,
