"Alice,  $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and its worth to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. Let's try to find a compromise here.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,500, so I'm offering it to you for $12,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and its worth to you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
