Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a ""take it or leave it"" price, I increase the chance Bob will act quickly out of fear of missing out.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I know John will purchase the product at my desired minimum."
