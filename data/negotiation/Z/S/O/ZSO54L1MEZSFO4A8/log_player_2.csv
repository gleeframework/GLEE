"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.**  This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $30** compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice and $150 to you, the fact that Alice is willing to sell for $120 makes it a good deal for you. You get a product you value highly at a lower price."
