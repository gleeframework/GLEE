Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $850,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. Let's try to negotiate a better deal.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $850,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach a mutual agreement that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob seems firm on his $850,000 offer, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. It's time to make a decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's lower than our initial target, $850,000 is still a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk prolonged negotiation that might not lead to a much better outcome."
