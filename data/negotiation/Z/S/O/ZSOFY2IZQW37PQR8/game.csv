"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference this time.  I'll come down to $10,125. This is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,5,
