"I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm already making a significant concession.  $12,500 is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet there, I understand, and I'll wish you the best in finding what you need.",12500.0,Alice,7,
