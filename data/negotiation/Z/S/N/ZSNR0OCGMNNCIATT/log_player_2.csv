"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you something truly exceptional. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high, and it's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  It's unlikely she'll drop to $1,000,000 in one round, but it's worth trying!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I'm hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm comfortable going up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price given the product's value and my needs.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and land at $1,175,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

While $1,175,000 is tempting, I'm still determined to get the price lower.  I'll counteroffer again and hope Alice is willing to come down further."
