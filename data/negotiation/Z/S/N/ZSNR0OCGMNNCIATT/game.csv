"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you something truly exceptional. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth to both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm comfortable going up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price given the product's value and my needs.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and land at $1,175,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about we meet at $1,150,000?  It's a fair price considering we're both trying to find a middle ground.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next round or two.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
