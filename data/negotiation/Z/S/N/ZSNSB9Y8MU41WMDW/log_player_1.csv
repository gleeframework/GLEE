**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unable or unwilling to meet a price point that is significantly above his own valuation of the product ($1,200,000). While continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher offer from Bob, it's unlikely he'll dramatically increase his offer to a level that would be significantly more appealing than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. 

At this point, the time and effort involved in further negotiation with Bob likely outweigh the potential marginal gain. Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed, clean sale at a price that avoids further hassle."
