"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12,500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
