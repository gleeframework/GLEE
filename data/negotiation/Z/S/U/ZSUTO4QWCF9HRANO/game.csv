"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500 for this product.  This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still interested in the product, but  $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",13250.0,Alice,5,
