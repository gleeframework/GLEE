"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  You can make a counteroffer, potentially saving some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

It's worth trying to negotiate further. You're still closer to your desired price of $12,000 than Alice's offer of $13,750. You can try a counteroffer closer to your target price, but be mindful of the risk of pushing too hard and losing the deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,250.

Alice has come down to $13,250, which is within your budget and a good compromise. It's better to accept her offer than risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate or buying from John for a higher price."
