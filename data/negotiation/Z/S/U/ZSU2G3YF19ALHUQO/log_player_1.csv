"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer above Bob's perceived value but below our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" we subtly justify the high price without revealing our hand. 
* **Positivity:**  A positive tone encourages a good negotiating relationship.

This strategy balances ambition with flexibility, setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum. We have room to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees our desired price.  We'll counter to gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm confident this product offers significantly more value than that. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,110,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate the product's value, justifying a higher price.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We've made a notable drop from our initial offer, signaling willingness to negotiate while still aiming above Bob's initial counter.
* **Framing:** Presenting it as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more aggressive move towards our desired price point. 

We're aiming for a deal that benefits both parties while keeping a healthy margin above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $1,075,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, showing he's willing to negotiate. However, we're still significantly below our minimum, and accepting now would leave a substantial amount of money on the table. We have the leverage of John's offer, so we'll continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be upfront - I can't let this product go for anything less than $1,100,000.  It's a final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price considering the value you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** We've made several concessions and need to establish a firm bottom line. Presenting this as a ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're again highlighting the product's value to Bob, subtly shifting focus away from the price difference.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is still a significant profit for us while leaving Bob with a potentially appealing deal compared to searching elsewhere. 

This approach aims for a favorable resolution while preparing to walk away if necessary, leveraging the security of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe we can come to an agreement closer to my original proposal. I would like to counter with $1,085,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored to his initial offer and unwilling to meet our minimum requirement. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significant change in his position. 

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially a better deal with other buyers.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John ensures we receive our desired price without further concessions or uncertainty. 

While we aimed for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob, walking away maintains our position and ensures a profitable outcome."
