```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
