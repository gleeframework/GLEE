"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a little high for me, I was hoping to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price point wouldn't be feasible for me. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair offer for the value this product provides.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $12,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",12000.0,Bob,4,
