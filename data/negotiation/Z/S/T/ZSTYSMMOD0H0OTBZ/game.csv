"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is outside my budget. How about $14,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $16,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. That's a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $15,000, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16,000? This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
