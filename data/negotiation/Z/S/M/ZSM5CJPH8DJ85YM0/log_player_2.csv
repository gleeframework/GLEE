You can do better than $110. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $80, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

It's worth continuing to negotiate. Even though Alice is meeting you halfway, you can still do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $105, Bob. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $100, and I think $105 is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle again! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is firm on $105, which is still higher than your target price of $80.  It's better to go with John's offer at this point."
