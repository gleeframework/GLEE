"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Given its value, I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is far too high. You are only willing to pay up to $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You're determined to get the product for no more than $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident this product can truly benefit you.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than your budget of $8,000.  While you could try to counter-offer again, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your offer and you might run out of rounds before reaching an agreement.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $8,000 and secure the product at your desired price."
