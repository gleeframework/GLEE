{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him a little incentive to accept.  However, it still leaves me room for negotiation and ensures I'm not giving away too much value. I'm also emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob to further encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise for both of us. It's still a great price for a product of this quality.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer at $9,100. This price is still within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close to my desired price and just $100 less than my last counteroffer.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiations will be time-consuming and might result in a lower price. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale close to my desired price."
