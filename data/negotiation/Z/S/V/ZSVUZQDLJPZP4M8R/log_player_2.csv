"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal target of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,500 at this point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob starts by offering a price closer to his ideal of $8,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also that he's not willing to overpay. 
* **Reasonable offer:** $9,500 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's significantly higher than her valuation of $8,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation without making Bob seem too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you do $10,500?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still above Bob's ideal target. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate, as the price is closer to Bob's range. He can try to push for a lower price without risking losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $12,000 is a fallback option, but Bob is still better off trying to secure a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a price that's a good compromise between Alice's last offer and his ideal price. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** Bob highlights the ""fairness"" of the offer, aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make this deal happen!"" subtly adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to accept the offer."
