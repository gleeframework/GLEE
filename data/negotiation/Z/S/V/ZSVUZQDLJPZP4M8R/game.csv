"Alice, thanks for the offer. $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,500 at this point. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you do $10,500?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Bob,4,
