Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **It highlights the value for Bob:** By mentioning the product's worth to him, it incentivizes him to accept the offer.
* **It's open to counteroffers:** The message invites Bob to negotiate, creating a more collaborative atmosphere. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response, or choose to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price point of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

$9,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my desired price point of $10,000, and it's still a better deal than selling to John for $8,000.  I'm going to accept this offer."
