"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's a game-changer in its field, offering unparalleled benefits and efficiency. Considering its immense value, we're offering it to you at an exclusive price of $900,000. We believe this is a fantastic opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive, but not unbeatable.**  While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation, especially considering Alice values the product at $1,000,000.
* **It's early in the negotiation.** It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to drop her price further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in your product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This reflects the significant value I see in the product, while also acknowledging the need for a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the high value of our product, I am proposing a price of $825,000. This still offers a significant discount compared to the original price, while reflecting the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to my price point, but there's still room for negotiation.**  She's come down from $900,000 to $825,000, which shows she's willing to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a lower price.
* **I want to see if I can push her further.**  By rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer, I might be able to secure a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is still a backup option.**  I'm not desperate enough to take Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. Based on our previous discussions, I propose a price of $812,500 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while being more in line with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.**  She's now offering $812,500, which is closer to my desired price point. 
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.**  We're getting into smaller increments, and further negotiation could result in more back and forth without a guarantee of a better deal. 
* **John's offer is still a backup.** If I reject Alice's offer, there's no guarantee she'll come down further, and I might end up paying John's full price. 

**It's a good deal at this point, and I'm not willing to risk losing it.**"
