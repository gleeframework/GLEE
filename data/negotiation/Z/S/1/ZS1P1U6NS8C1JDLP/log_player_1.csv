{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love.  I'm asking for $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being above your minimum price.  It also includes a friendly message to establish a positive tone and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm happy to negotiate further, but I can't go that low. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. How about $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $82.50 is above my minimum price of $80 and is a reasonable compromise. It's better than selling to John for $80. I'll accept Bob's offer."
