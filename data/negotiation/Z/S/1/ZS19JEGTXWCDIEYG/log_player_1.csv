"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives me a little room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it's a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay more than the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is still above my minimum and gives Bob some room to negotiate up. It also shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,200. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I think there's still some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm being reasonable and come up a little bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough one.  $7,900 is getting very close to my minimum, and I've only got 4 rounds left.  But, I've already been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to feel like Bob is just playing games.  Jhon is guaranteed to buy it at my minimum price. I'm going to sell to Jhon."
