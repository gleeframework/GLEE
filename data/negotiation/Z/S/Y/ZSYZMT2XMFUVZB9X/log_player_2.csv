"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's offering $9,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's offer but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's previous offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to try to get a lower price. He's willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's latest offer of $10,500.  Offering $9,500 shows that Bob is still committed to buying the product but is also trying to be reasonable. It's a small concession, but it could be enough to get Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $10,200 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still above his maximum limit of $8,000. Bob is willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially save a significant amount of money. He's also nearing the halfway point of his negotiations, giving him a better sense of Alice's negotiation style and potential room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to find a middle ground, this time between his previous offer of $9,500 and Alice's latest offer of $10,200. He's increasing his offer slightly to show his commitment, but he's still within a reasonable range for both parties. He's trying to find a sweet spot that Alice might be willing to accept to avoid further rounds and the risk of Bob buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still more than his maximum limit of $8,000.  With only three rounds remaining, Bob is still pushing for a better price. He can still save $2,000 by going with John, and he might be able to get even closer to his budget by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  The fact that Alice is willing to lower her price suggests she's starting to feel the pressure, and Bob might be able to get her to come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9850}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to get the best possible price.  He's offering $9,850, which is only $150 away from his maximum budget and shows a serious commitment to getting the deal done.  He's betting that Alice will see this as a fair compromise, especially with only two rounds remaining and the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, Bob has a difficult decision.  While $9,900 is the closest Alice has come to his budget, it's still $1,900 more than he wants to spend.  The risk of another round with Alice is too high, as there's no guarantee she'll come down further.  It's more prudent to go with John, who offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget and allows him to close the deal and move on."
