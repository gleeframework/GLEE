"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to make a profit, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
