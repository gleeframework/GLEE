"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is more than what the product is worth to me, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a decent discount for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.  We have 10 rounds to work with, so I'm starting with a strong offer, but leaving room to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to maintain my value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  We have several rounds left and I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500, but that's my maximum. Can we meet in the middle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. Although it's not ideal, it's still above my minimum desired price of $10,000. With 6 rounds remaining, I'd rather secure a sale now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
