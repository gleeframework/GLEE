"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to try negotiating a lower price with Alice first. While $140 is close to your budget, there's room to potentially save more before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with an offer that's in your favor. This leaves room for negotiation and signals you're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating your price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $110, we're aiming for a price that's significantly below Alice's asking price but still allows for some back-and-forth. It also gives us room to negotiate up towards our $150 maximum if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation.  You haven't reached your maximum budget, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That seems like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a common negotiation tactic - meeting in the middle of the last offers ($130 and $110). It presents a sense of compromise.
* **Reaching Your Target:** This offer is the maximum you are willing to pay and aligns perfectly with your goal of saving money. 
* **Potential for Acceptance:** It's likely Alice might accept this offer since it's close to her product's value to her ($120) and still gives her a small profit."
