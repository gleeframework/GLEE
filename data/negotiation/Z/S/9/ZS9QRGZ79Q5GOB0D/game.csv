"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $130, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer, so I can do $122.50. Let me know if this works for you.",122.5,Alice,5,
