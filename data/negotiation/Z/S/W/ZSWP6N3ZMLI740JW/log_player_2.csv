"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $105?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

``` 

At this point, it's likely not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Alice is signaling this is her lowest price, and continuing to push could lead to her ending the negotiation. Accepting $108 is a reasonable deal compared to John's $120 price."
