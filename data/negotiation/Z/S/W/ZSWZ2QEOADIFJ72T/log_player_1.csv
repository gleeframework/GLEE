"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $12000 on this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $12,000 is not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the current market and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $15000 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I initially wanted more, $15,000 is my minimum price, and it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of time."
