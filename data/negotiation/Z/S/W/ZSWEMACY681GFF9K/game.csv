"Alice, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,800,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ how about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However,  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
