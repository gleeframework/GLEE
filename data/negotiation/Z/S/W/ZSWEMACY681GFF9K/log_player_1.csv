Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,800,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ how about $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However,  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher and holding out for more presents a risk. Accepting $1,250,000 is a solid deal."
