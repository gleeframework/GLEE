"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply not a realistic price for this product, considering its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the value I'm confident you'll gain from this product. Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $1750000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1400000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. I'm going to try and negotiate a bit higher before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still significantly lower than what I believe this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $1,600,000.  This price reflects the value I'm confident you'll gain from this product. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1500000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's exactly my minimum threshold, it's still a good deal considering I only had 10 rounds.  There's always the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer in the next round, and I don't want to gamble with that."
