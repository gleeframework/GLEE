This offer is $200,000 less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to potentially negotiate. However, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I'm making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it is more than my absolute minimum (selling to John), I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Can you consider this revised price?

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's within my acceptable range and a significant improvement from his previous offer.  While I'd prefer my initial price, it's better to secure a deal than continue negotiating and risk losing the sale altogether."
