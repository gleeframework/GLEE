Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,000. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still getting significantly more than the $8,000 John is offering."
