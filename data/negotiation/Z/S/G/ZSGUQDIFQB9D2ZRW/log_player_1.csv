"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the value to Bob can encourage him to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully closed the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter-offer based on the remaining rounds and my goal of maximizing profit. 
* If the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome, I can always switch to John and get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's initial rejection indicates he's willing to negotiate. There's a possibility of getting closer to my desired price in the next rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Monitor Rounds:** I'll carefully track the remaining rounds to make informed decisions based on the potential of a successful deal with Bob and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a favorable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, hoping to find a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I'll keep track of the remaining rounds and be prepared to adjust my counteroffers based on the time remaining and the likelihood of reaching a successful deal.
* **John's Offer:** I'll always be mindful of John's offer of $15,000, and I'll switch to selling to John if I believe I can't get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're moving closer.  While $10,500 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  I'm noticing a pattern of increasing offers from Bob, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.
* **Time Factor:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have enough time to keep negotiating and potentially get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my desired range, aiming for a price closer to $10,500.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  I'll continue to use a combination of strategic counteroffers and highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'll only consider selling to him if I believe I can't get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,500.  How about $10,000? That seems like a fair compromise, allowing you to get the product at a great price and me to get closer to my desired value. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's current offer ($9,500). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the value the product brings him, emphasizing that $10,000 is still a great price compared to its worth for him.
* **Time Remaining:** With 5 rounds left, I have enough time to continue negotiating without rushing into a deal that's significantly below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and his offer in the next round. If he accepts, I've successfully closed the deal. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Strategic Counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll continue to use strategic counteroffers, gradually moving closer to his offer while keeping my desired profit margin in mind.
* **Monitor John's Offer:**  I'll remain aware of John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net, especially if the negotiations with Bob start to stall or if the remaining rounds become limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $10,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still $5,250 less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob's claim of a final offer adds pressure to accept, but I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, suggesting he might be willing to go a little higher, especially if he truly wants the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll make a final counteroffer aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I'll emphasize the value the product offers to him and try to find a middle ground.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With 4 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers to secure a profitable deal.
* **John's Offer as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm still aiming to close the deal with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $9,875. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer slightly above Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to close the deal, but it keeps my price above the $9,750 he offered.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I highlight the ""fair compromise"" aspect, aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to get closer to a deal, but I can't concede too much.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he accepts, the deal is closed. If he rejects, I'll need to make a final decision in the next round.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'll only consider selling to him if Bob rejects my next offer.
* **Final Decision:** If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer or move on to John. With only one round remaining, I'll need to weigh the potential for a higher offer from Bob against the certainty of John's $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come down.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,600. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, the pressure to close a deal is increasing, but the current price is still too low.
* **Minimal Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to his previous offer, indicating limited room for further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a guarantee of my minimum acceptable price, and there's a high chance that I won't be able to get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer and attempt to counteroffer, there's a risk of Bob rejecting it, resulting in a lost deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and secures a deal with certainty. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** By accepting John's offer, I'm minimizing the potential loss from further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to meet my minimum."
