"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1400000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? This would allow me to cover my costs and potentially open the door to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to cover your costs, but I'm still a bit far from my budget of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you think of any other creative solutions to make this work?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
