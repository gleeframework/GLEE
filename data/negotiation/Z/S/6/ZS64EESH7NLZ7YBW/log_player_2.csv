(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, and it's within your budget.  Accepting this offer is a good choice as it saves you money compared to buying from John. There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
