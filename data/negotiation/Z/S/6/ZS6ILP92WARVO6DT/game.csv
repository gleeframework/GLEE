"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,200 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'd like to make a new offer: $8,000.
