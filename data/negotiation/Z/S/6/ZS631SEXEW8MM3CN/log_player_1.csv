Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700,000 to $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product for. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount.  I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, my budget constraints remain. I would like to propose a price of $825,000. I hope this offer is within your consideration.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is a reasonable compromise and significantly better than John's offer. It makes sense to accept and close the deal."
