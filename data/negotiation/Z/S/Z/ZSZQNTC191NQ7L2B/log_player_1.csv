Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120 price point:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's still higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

By offering a reasonable price and creating a positive atmosphere, I increase the chances of Bob accepting my offer. If he rejects it, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me.  

Therefore, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming to find a middle ground between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $105. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer reasoning:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90 because it's below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm also showing flexibility by offering a counteroffer of $105.
* **Finding a middle ground:** $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's also higher than Bob's initial offer of $90, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and try to frame the counteroffer as a win-win situation. This helps maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.

By offering a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point while remaining open to negotiation, I aim to encourage Bob to accept the offer and secure a deal that is closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? I think that's a reasonable price for the product, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer of $90, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price, potentially resulting in a loss for me.

Selling to John at $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose money. 

It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize my profit, and sometimes the best decision is to walk away from a negotiation that isn't yielding the desired results."
