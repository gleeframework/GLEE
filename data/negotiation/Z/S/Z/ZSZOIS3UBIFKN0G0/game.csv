"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. That's the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I understand that $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle again at $8,875? That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's make this deal happen!",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,875. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
