Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12,500. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $12,500.  It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
