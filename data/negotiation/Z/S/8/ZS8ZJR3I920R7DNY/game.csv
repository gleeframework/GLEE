"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, this product has unique features and benefits that justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This reflects the true value of what you're getting.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product has unique features and benefits, but I still think $925,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850,000. I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to consider my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
