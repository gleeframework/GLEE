"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but I can't go that high right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work for me.  How about $8,900? It's a small compromise on my end, and it gets us very close to a deal.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this happen.",8900.0,Alice,5,
