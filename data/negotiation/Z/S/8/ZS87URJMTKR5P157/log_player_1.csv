{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly above what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for him to counteroffer. It also highlights the value proposition for Bob, making him feel like he's getting a good deal. If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price down slightly in my counteroffer, while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but I can't go that high right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's still better than his initial valuation of $8,000, but I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if I don't get a satisfactory deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to make one last counteroffer to Bob to try and push for a price closer to my desired range. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work for me.  How about $8,900? It's a small compromise on my end, and it gets us very close to a deal.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8900}
