"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget.  I'm very interested in this product but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum, and it's what I'd be willing to pay to acquire it from another source. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, the value this product offers is truly significant. Let's meet halfway - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,200,000 is still outside my range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
