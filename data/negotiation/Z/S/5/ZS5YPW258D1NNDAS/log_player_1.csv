Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more to you than it is to me. How about $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is high but still significantly below Bob's perceived value, making it likely he'll accept.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed $80 from John, so there's limited risk in aiming high."
