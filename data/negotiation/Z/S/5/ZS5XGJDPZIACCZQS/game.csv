"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this price is still a good compromise and reflects the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $850,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $850,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,7,
