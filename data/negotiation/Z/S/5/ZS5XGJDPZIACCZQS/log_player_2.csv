"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can do better.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her original offer, $850,000 is still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this price is still a good compromise and reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to come down, $875,000 is still above Bob's target price.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and there are still rounds left to negotiate. He can likely secure a better price by rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $850,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $850,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her original asking price of $900,000. Bob has only two rounds remaining, and there's a high probability that Alice will not budge further.  With only two rounds left,  the potential for additional savings is limited. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, as this price is still within his budget and ensures a purchase without further negotiation."
