"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to go down to $11,000?  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for something closer to $12,500.  This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still a bit too high.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for further exploration of a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $12,500, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
