"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to go down to $11,000?  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for something closer to $12,500.  This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for $12,500, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Let's make it happen!",12000.0,Bob,4,
