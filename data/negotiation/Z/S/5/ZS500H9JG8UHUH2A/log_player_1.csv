Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to go down to $11,000?  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $11,000 is still too low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for something closer to $12,500.  This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for $12,500, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Let's make it happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer of $12,000 is very close to my desired price and a good compromise. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
