"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting the value of the product and a fair compromise. This would still allow you to realize significant gains from this investment.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
