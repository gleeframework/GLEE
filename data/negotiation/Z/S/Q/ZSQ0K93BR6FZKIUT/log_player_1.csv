Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting near the top of the ZOPA, aiming for the best possible outcome.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" emphasize the product's value. 
* **Focus on Bob's Gain:** Highlighting the ""significant returns"" speaks directly to Bob's potential benefit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,400,000) to give room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price for the sake of a smoother deal."
