Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a hard price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a compromise.
* **Maintaining the option of John:**  This offer still allows me to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and also below my initial offer. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Potential for compromise:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Maintaining the John option:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps my option open to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:** $12,000 is still above Bob's perceived value but significantly closer to my minimum price. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  The offer is still open to further negotiation, allowing for a potential win-win scenario."
