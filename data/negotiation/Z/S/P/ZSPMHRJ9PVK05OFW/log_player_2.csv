"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $115 is better than John's offer of $120, but still above your ideal price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate further with her or explore other options before settling for the $120 price from John."
