"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the immense value it holds and offers a more reasonable compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your product's potential, $1,900,000 remains out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I'm confident we can find common ground with this revised proposal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It seems we both recognize the value here. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000. I truly believe this product holds significant value, and I'm making a substantial effort to close this deal. I hope you'll consider this offer, as it demonstrates my genuine desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
