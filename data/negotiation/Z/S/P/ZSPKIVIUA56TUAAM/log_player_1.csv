"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a high but not entirely unreasonable offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique potential"" and ""significant value"" is aimed at justifying the high initial price, even though we know Bob's valuation is lower.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price gives us significant room to negotiate downwards throughout the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to negotiate a deal, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better price with further rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the immense value it holds and offers a more reasonable compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer ($400,000) to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. However, the new price ($1,900,000) is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price point, hoping to nudge Bob's perception closer to mine. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation towards a middle ground, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your product's potential, $1,900,000 remains out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I'm confident we can find common ground with this revised proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'd rather keep negotiating for a higher price from Bob than settle for $1,000,000 right now. I'm willing to see if I can get him closer to $1,300,000 in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It seems we both recognize the value here. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm making another significant concession ($300,000), demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob closer to the middle ground. 
* **Highlighting Bob's Movement:** By pointing out that Bob has also increased his offer, I'm subtly reinforcing that progress is being made, and a deal is within reach.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts me in a stronger position to either negotiate down towards my minimum acceptable price or walk away if Bob isn't willing to budge significantly from his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000. I truly believe this product holds significant value, and I'm making a substantial effort to close this deal. I hope you'll consider this offer, as it demonstrates my genuine desire to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting close enough to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures I make a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds. There's always a chance he could refuse further negotiation, and I'd rather secure this deal now than risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer."
