Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This offer stands as a compromise and reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

This is a good deal! It's better to take the $16,000 profit now than risk Bob walking away and getting only $15,000 from John."
