"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, which is a bit closer to my original price. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $115, and I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $122.50, which is getting close to my minimum price. I think it's a fair offer, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $122.50 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $117.50, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",117.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your last offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $119.25, which is still a bit above my minimum price but closer to your offer. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",119.25,Alice,7,
