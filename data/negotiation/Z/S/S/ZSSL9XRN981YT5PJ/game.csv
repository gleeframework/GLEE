"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $700,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
