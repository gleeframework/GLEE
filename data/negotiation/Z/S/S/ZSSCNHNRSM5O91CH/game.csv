,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $80.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90. It's a fair deal for both of us and lets us both walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,
