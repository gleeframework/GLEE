"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a good price for myself.  I'm also emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob, hoping to entice him into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too far below my minimum price of $15,000, and I believe I can get a better price through negotiation. I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $12,000 might be a bit high,  $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my $15,000 floor. I believe I can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway again, but I'm not willing to drop below $10,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for the value this product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
