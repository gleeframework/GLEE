"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $12,000 might be a bit high,  $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for the value this product offers.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for the value this product will bring you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
