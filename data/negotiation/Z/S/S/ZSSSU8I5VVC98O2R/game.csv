"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
