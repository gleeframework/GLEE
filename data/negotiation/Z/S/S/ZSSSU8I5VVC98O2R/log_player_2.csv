"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. While it's good to know the product is worth more to her, we have room to negotiate. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer gives us a chance to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counteroffer helps us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Establish our target price:** Starting lower gives us more ground to work with as we negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved closer to our desired price range, but we can still negotiate.  We're only $500 away from John's price, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're proposing a price directly in the middle of her current offer and our previous counteroffer. This signals our willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better deal than John's.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We're getting closer to John's price, and explicitly mentioning a ""compromise"" might encourage Alice to close the deal sooner rather than risk us walking away."
