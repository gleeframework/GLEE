Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a price closer to $80. We'll counter-offer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested, Bob! Let's try $90 as a compromise. It's a bit higher than your last offer but still below my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a good compromise. It's better to secure the deal now at $90 rather than risk it going nowhere and having to settle for John's $100 offer."
