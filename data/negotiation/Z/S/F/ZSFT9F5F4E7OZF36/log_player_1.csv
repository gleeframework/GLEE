"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both our valuations. This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's high value.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to acquire the product and set the stage for the subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. While I want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer in Round 2 would be leaving a lot of money on the table.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** I've made a significant concession to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** My counteroffer is still well above both our minimum valuations, but it's a strong step towards finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time Constraint:** I'm mindful of the 10-round limit, so I'm aiming for a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal within a reasonable timeframe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $950,000? This offer reflects the serious interest I have in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly below my target price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push him closer to my minimum valuation. Accepting $950,000 now would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your persistence demonstrates your understanding of this product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This offer reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my offer amount, but not as drastically as before. This signals that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of my price, reinforcing the idea that the product is worth a significant investment. 
* **Urgency:** By stating my desire to close a deal, I'm subtly introducing a sense of time sensitivity, encouraging Bob to make a more substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest,  $1,125,000 is a bit too close to my limit for me to be comfortable. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer.  It reflects the absolute maximum I can afford for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Valuations:** Bob has finally reached his maximum valuation for the product, which matches John's offer.
* **Limited Upside:** Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now ensures I receive the payment without further delay. 

While I started with the goal of earning more than $1,000,000, Bob's final offer represents a fair deal given the circumstances and the information available."
