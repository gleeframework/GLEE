"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial asking price. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can't go higher than $875,000.  This price represents a significant investment for me and is as close as I can get to meeting you halfway. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875,000 is as high as you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
