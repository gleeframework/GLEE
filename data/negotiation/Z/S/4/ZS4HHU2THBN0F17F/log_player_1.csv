Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $13,500?  It's still a good price for a product worth a lot more to you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I believe there's room for a compromise, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I understand your budget, but I need a little more to make this work for me. Let's split the difference - how about $12,750? That's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I am willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is within my budget and also closer to your last offer. I hope this proposal works for you.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
