"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $13,500?  It's still a good price for a product worth a lot more to you. Let's see if we can work something out.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to stick to my original budget of $12,000. Is there any way we can meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I understand your budget, but I need a little more to make this work for me. Let's split the difference - how about $12,750? That's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if that works for you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
