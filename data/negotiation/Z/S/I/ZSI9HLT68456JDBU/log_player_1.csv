Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable. I've set the price at $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a much higher profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and implies the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't be forced to accept an offer below my minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If I knew Bob was very price-sensitive, I might start lower. However, this approach aims for the best possible outcome.
* **Negotiation:** This is just the opening offer. Bob might counter-offer, and I'll need to be prepared to negotiate strategically to reach a mutually agreeable price."
