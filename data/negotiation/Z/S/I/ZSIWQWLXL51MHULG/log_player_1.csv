"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,000,000, as this is still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate but keeps me close to my desired outcome.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and framing the offer as fair, which can help establish a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price as close to $1,200,000 as possible. I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit.  By offering a lower price than my minimum value, I can leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that is so drastically lower than my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation. However, I need to be careful to not push Bob away with an offer that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, while getting me closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price to $950,000. This is a substantial decrease from my initial offer of $1,000,000, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a significant increase from his offer of $850,000, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and acknowledging Bob's concerns, but firmly stating my counter-offer. I'm emphasizing the potential for profit for Bob and how this offer helps us both get closer to our desired outcomes.

**Strategy:**

By lowering my price slightly, I'm demonstrating flexibility and encouraging further negotiation. My goal is to find a middle ground between our desired prices, but not to drop too far below my minimum. I'm keeping the negotiation open and aiming for a deal that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a fair value for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm determined to get a better price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll continue to negotiate, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum value. However, I'll need to be careful to not push Bob away with an offer that's too high.  I'm also mindful of the limited rounds and the potential to sell to John for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to reaching an agreement. While $900,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offers you a significant value, and we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $975,000, which is a significant decrease from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying close to my desired range.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the progress made towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm framing the offer as a way to bridge the remaining gap, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to my minimum value but not so high that it jeopardizes the negotiation. I'm trying to find a compromise point while keeping in mind the limited rounds and the possibility of selling to John.  This counteroffer should be compelling enough for Bob to consider accepting, but it also leaves some room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair offer that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  I have several rounds remaining, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I could potentially get. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum value, but also keeps the negotiation open. I'm aware of the limited rounds and the potential to sell to John, so I need to find a balance between pushing for a better price and ensuring the deal doesn't fall apart."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to reach a deal that works for us. While I appreciate your offer of $925,000, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit.  Let's finalize this now and make this a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $950,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer of $925,000 and moves us closer to a potential agreement.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, reminding Bob that we are both trying to reach a beneficial deal.  I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect of the offer, making it more appealing and urging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price closer to my minimum value while still being realistic about Bob's potential to accept.  By offering $950,000, I'm hoping to strike a balance between securing a favorable price and avoiding a stalemate.  The limited rounds and the possibility of selling to John for a higher price are still in my mind, but I believe this offer is compelling enough to convince Bob to accept."
