,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, while getting me closer to my desired price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a fair value for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to reaching an agreement. While $900,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offers you a significant value, and we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair offer that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal now.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to reach a deal that works for us. While I appreciate your offer of $925,000, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit.  Let's finalize this now and make this a win-win situation.",950000.0,Alice,7,
