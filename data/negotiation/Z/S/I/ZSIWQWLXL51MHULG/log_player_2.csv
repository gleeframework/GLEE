"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, while getting me closer to my desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob has a better chance of getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows him to counter and try to bring the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a fair value for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer while keeping it below his maximum. This counteroffer shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but also that he's not going to go significantly above his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to reaching an agreement. While $900,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offers you a significant value, and we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob has 5 rounds left, which is enough time to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation process and try to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair offer that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to Alice's price but is still below his maximum budget.  This counteroffer demonstrates his willingness to compromise while also showing he won't go significantly higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to reach a deal that works for us. While I appreciate your offer of $925,000, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit.  Let's finalize this now and make this a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob has 3 rounds left, but considering the progress in the negotiation, it's unlikely he can get the price lower than his maximum.  To avoid further delays and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob should buy it from John for $800,000."
