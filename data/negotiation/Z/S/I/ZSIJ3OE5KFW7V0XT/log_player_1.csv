"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone might encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway him towards a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay up to $8,000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have several rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $12,000, but I'd like to maximize my profit if possible."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great price considering the product's value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain value:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm open to negotiation, but still maintaining a profit margin that's closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasize value again:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Keep the door open:** I'm using a friendly tone and leaving space for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'd like to stick to my original budget of $8,000. This is the maximum I can afford for this product. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Remaining rounds:** I have several rounds left to try and secure a better price.  
* **John is a reliable alternative:** Selling to John for $12,000 is still a good option if I can't reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I want to make this work. However, I can't go any lower than $9,000.

I'm open to discussing this further, but  I'm  ready to move on if we can't come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still firm on a price that's more than my minimum. This demonstrates I'm serious about getting a good price.

* **Open to Discussion:** While firm on the price, I'm still open to discussion to try and secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to the End:**  With this being the final round, there's no chance for further negotiation. 
* **Still Below Minimum:** $8,875 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **John is a Better Option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a profit that's significantly higher than what Bob is offering. 

Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to sway me from my minimum price. I'm better off selling to John and securing the better deal."
