{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm  meeting Bob halfway by offering a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer and higher than my minimum. I'm willing to accept it to close the deal and avoid risking further negotiation."
