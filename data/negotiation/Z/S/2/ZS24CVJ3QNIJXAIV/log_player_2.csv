"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. My asking price is $100, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to buy the product for as low a price as possible, ideally below your maximum of $120.
* Alice's initial offer of $100 is higher than your ideal price.
* It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are trying to get the product for under $120, ideally as low as possible.
* Alice's offer of $95 is still a bit higher than you'd like.
* You have rounds left to negotiate further. It's worth continuing to see if you can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
