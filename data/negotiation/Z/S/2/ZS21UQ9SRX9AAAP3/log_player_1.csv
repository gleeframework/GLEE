"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about $87.50?  That's halfway between our last offers, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $87.50 is a fair deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
