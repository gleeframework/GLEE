Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $100. 
* You've already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has consistently rejected them. 
* This indicates that there's a significant gap in your desired price and Alice's bottom line.
* You can get the product for $100 from John, which is within your budget and a better deal than anything Alice is offering. 
* It's more efficient to simply buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
