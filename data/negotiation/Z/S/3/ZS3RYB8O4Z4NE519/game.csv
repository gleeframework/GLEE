"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1800000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1800000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's benefits. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
