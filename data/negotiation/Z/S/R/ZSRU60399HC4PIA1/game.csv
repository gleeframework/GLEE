"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
