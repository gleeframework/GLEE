"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save money, and Alice's offer is too high.  You should reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to save money. While $8,200 is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially get it lower.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer might get you closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go down to $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle at $8,500? This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $8,500, which is more than you're willing to pay. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Alice will come down further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures you get the product at your desired price without further negotiation."
