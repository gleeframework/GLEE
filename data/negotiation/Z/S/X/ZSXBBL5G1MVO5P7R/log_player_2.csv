"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $10,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but I'm not quite ready to pay $12,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is $10,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than your ideal price of $10,000, but you're willing to keep negotiating. It's worth trying to get closer to your target price, especially with 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still hesitant to go above $10,000. This product holds great value for me, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? It would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still above your target price of $10,000. You have 5 rounds remaining, so there is time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. It's possible you could convince Alice to drop to your desired price, or at least get closer to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500 without getting a bit more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $10,500, which is $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your target price of $10,000. While you have three rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Alice will agree to your desired price.  With only three rounds left, there's a risk that you could end up with a worse deal if you continue negotiating and run out of time. 

Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring you get the product at your desired price."
