Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant value it can bring to your operations.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows it's worth $1,500,000 to John. Starting high ($1,300,000) leaves room for negotiation while staying closer to the higher potential sale price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to frame it as a valuable investment for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and open to discussion,  giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above his initial valuation. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared for Bob to reject the offer. If negotiations don't lead to a price Alice finds acceptable, she has the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at $1,500,000."
