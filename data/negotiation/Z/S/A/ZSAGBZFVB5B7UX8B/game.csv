"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind for this acquisition.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. Considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  I can go up to $750,000, but that's absolutely my limit. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. Considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",825000.0,Alice,7,
