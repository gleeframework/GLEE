"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,175,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching a final agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
