"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate if Bob rejects. It's also a reasonable starting point, leaving space for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $80 is a fair price, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you be willing to pay $90 for the product? It's a great value for the features you'll get, and I believe you'll be very satisfied."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $85 is a fair price considering Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's a good compromise and better than selling to John for $80."
