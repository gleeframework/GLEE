"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is slightly better than its true value to you ($8,000), you know you can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John.  There's no need to settle for a higher price when you have a better alternative lined up."
