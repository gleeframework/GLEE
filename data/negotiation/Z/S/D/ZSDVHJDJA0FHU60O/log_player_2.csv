"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by you. Considering its quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $140 for it. This price reflects a fair balance between its value and what I believe the market should bear. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $140. This is above Bob's maximum value. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $140 is a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay up to $120 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
