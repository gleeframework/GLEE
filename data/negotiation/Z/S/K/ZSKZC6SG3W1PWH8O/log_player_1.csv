Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to capture as much value as possible. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I want to see if I can get closer to that number.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if needed, but I want to establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
