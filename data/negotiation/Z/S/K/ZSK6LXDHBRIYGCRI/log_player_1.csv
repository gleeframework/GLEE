Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for me. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm not in a hurry to sell, so I'll see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal.  This should hopefully incentivize Bob to accept while still being a fair price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob has remained firm on his offer, and while it's not ideal, it's still a good deal. Accepting his offer secures a sale and ensures I get a decent profit.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for a lower price."
