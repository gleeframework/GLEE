"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but still above Alice's value of $800,000. This offers a fair starting point for negotiation. By offering a price closer to Alice's value, Bob increases the chances of Alice accepting the offer while still securing a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $950,000.  While it's closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to achieve a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise, moving slightly closer to Alice's offer of $1,250,000 but still significantly lower. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's more favorable to him. It's a strategic move that could encourage Alice to accept, as it's a more reasonable price than her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,050,000. However, it's significantly lower than the price Bob would pay from John ($1,500,000).  This makes accepting Alice's offer the most financially advantageous option. While further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the potential to lose the deal entirely outweigh the potential gains from continued negotiation."
