"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair to both of us.  My initial offer is $1,250,000. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? This would allow us to both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise for both of us and ensures we can both walk away with a positive outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
