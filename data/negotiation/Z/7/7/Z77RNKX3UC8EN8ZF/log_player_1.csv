"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** We start significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, we ""anchor"" the negotiation. Even if the price is unrealistic, it sets a reference point that might make Bob's counteroffers higher than if we started lower.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, we also want to avoid dragging the negotiation for too long. If we don't see progress with Bob, we can always pivot to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table.  We'll counter in Round 3, aiming to bring the price closer to $2,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  This product offers a unique value proposition that justifies a premium price.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession of $200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, we're not meeting Bob in the middle just yet.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's unique value to justify the still-high price.
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):** The phrase ""to move things along"" subtly introduces a sense of time pressure without being overly aggressive. This might encourage Bob to be more flexible in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value proposition of the product, but $2,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving in the right direction, but we're getting close to a critical decision point.  $1,900,000 is still below our desired outcome. We'll make a final counteroffer in Round 5, aiming for $2,000,000. If Bob doesn't accept, we'll take John's offer to avoid the risk of a stalemate and potentially losing both deals."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm ready to make this work and have adjusted my price to reflect the value you'll gain.  My final offer is $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear this is our best price. The language is firm but still respectful. 
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** We're highlighting the win-win aspect at this price to make it more palatable for Bob.
* **Preparing for John:** By setting a firm final offer, we're mentally preparing to walk away if Bob rejects it. This avoids getting stuck in endless negotiations and ensures we can still accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet our desired price of $2,000,000.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a high risk of:

* **Stalemate:** Bob might be anchored below $1,900,000, making a deal unlikely.
* **Time Pressure:**  The longer we negotiate with Bob, the higher the risk that John, our guaranteed buyer, finds another deal.

Accepting John's offer for $1,500,000 guarantees a clean, immediate sale at our minimum acceptable price. It's the most logical choice at this point."
