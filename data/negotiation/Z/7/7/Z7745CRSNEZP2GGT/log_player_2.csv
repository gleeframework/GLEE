Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that $15,000 is a more realistic price, and I'm not sure I want to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

``` 

Alice is signaling that she might not go much lower than $14,000.  While you could try to push for a slightly better deal, there's a risk she'll stick to her guns or even walk away.  Accepting at $14,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of missing out altogether."
