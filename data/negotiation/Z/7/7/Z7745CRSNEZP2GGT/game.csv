"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I also need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value this product brings. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  How about we settle at $13,500?  That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,200, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,200.",14200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $14,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $13,850?",13850.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that $15,000 is a more realistic price, and I'm not sure I want to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,7,
