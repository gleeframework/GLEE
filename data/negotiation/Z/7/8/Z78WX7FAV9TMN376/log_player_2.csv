"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for something of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's starting price is too high.  We have room to barter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counter-offer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me.  Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to get a better price. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand that, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
 ""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

We're proposing a price slightly closer to Alice's last offer while still maintaining a good distance from our initial offer.  This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $80 is the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to her value for the product. It's unlikely we'll get a better price, and it's a good deal compared to John's offer."
