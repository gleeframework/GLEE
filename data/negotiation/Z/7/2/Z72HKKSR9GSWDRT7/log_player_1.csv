"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and usefulness of the product to Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage engagement and allow him to voice his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob is clearly budget-conscious, he's still interested in the product. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore that further in subsequent rounds.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150, which guarantees my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still protecting my bottom line.
* **Reiterate product value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to keep it top of mind during negotiations.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet at $95? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $95 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to increase his offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John remains a backup:** Selling to John is always a safe option, but I'm willing to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a great deal on the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm offering a smaller concession than before, demonstrating that I'm getting closer to my minimum.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $105 is a fair price for both of us, balancing my needs with Bob's budget.
* **Value reminder:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open-ended question:**  This encourages Bob to respond and continue the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $105, which would be $100. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Although we're getting closer, there's still some room for negotiation to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a safe fallback:**  I can always sell to John for $150, so I have the option to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  How about we meet at $102.50?  It's a small compromise from both of us, and it brings us closer to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm offering a small concession, only $2.50 less than my previous offer. This shows I'm being reasonable and still willing to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:**  $102.50 is the midpoint between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($100). It emphasizes the fairness of the price and shows I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing that this price brings us closer to an agreement. This helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to keep the dialogue open and encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $98. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees my desired profit.  It's a safer option than continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

While I'd like to get a higher price, it's important to recognize when it's time to walk away and take a sure thing."
