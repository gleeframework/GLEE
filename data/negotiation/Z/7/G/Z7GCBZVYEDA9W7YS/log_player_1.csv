"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $88?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $88 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $88 is a reasonable offer.  I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is a very fair price, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 89}
