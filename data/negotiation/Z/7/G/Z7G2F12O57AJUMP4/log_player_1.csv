Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $12,000.  I'm willing to pay you $12,000 right now, and I think it's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $17,000, which is a bit above our previous discussion, but I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
