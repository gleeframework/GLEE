"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair market value considering its worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $12,000.  I'm willing to pay you $12,000 right now, and I think it's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's close this deal!",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $17,000, which is a bit above our previous discussion, but I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",17000.0,Alice,5,
