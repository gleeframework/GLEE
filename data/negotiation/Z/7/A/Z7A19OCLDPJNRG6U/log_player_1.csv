"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I still have 8 rounds left. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially given his willingness to pay a premium."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,050,000? This still leaves room for you to profit and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left and I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my target. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,100,000 right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, we are now in the 6th round and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,100,000 at this point, as we have 4 rounds left and selling to John for $1,200,000 is always a possibility."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,040,000, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 8th round, and Bob's offer of $1,040,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While there are two rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a better price with Bob.  It's better to secure the sale with John for $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
