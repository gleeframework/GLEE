"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider it?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This represents a significant discount for you, and it's a fair price for the value this product offers.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
