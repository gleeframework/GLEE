{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $1,200,000 is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a generous discount to entice Bob. I also mention the product's true value to subtly imply that there's limited room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  By offering $1,200,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. This serves as a backup and gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $900,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price point. This keeps the negotiation going and hopefully gets Bob closer to my target.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $900,000 but still below my minimum. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my profit margin."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a price of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. By stating that this is my ""lowest"" price, I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob to consider my offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** My minimum price is still $1,500,000, and I have John as a backup option.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

At this stage, it's important to be flexible but not give away too much. $1,000,000 is a fair compromise that allows me to earn a reasonable profit while also potentially persuading Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider it?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point. This keeps the negotiation going and gives me more leverage.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a potential buyer gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This represents a significant discount for you, and it's a fair price for the value this product offers.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a price of $1,025,000, which is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I'm highlighting the ""significant discount"" to emphasize the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** My minimum price is still $1,500,000, and I have John as a backup option. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

At this stage, it's important to be firm but also willing to compromise slightly.  $1,025,000 represents a reasonable compromise while still allowing me to achieve a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. Can you consider it?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price.
* **John as a Backup:**  It's time to take advantage of my backup option. Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is much higher than what I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed sale to John. It's time to cut my losses and secure a profit with John."
