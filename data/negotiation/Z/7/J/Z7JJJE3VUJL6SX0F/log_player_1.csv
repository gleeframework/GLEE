I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. This allows for some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer. It gives him a slightly better price than my previous offer while still ensuring I get a decent profit."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000.  I'm satisfied with the deal."
