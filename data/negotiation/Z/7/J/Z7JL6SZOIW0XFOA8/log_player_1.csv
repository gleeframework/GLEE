"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the value I place on the product.  I'll also be mindful of the 10 round limit and the opportunity to sell to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000, still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, he'll be more likely to accept my offer in this round.  We're getting close to the $1,000,000 floor, but I'm still confident the product is worth more to him."
