"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need at least $120 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference at $110?  That's the absolute most I can do.",110.0,Bob,4,
