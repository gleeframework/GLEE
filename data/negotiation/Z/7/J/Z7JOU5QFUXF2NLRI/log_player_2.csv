"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $135 is still higher than our ideal budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation we have. This gives Alice an opportunity to counter and keeps us further from our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? This is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our maximum budget. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
