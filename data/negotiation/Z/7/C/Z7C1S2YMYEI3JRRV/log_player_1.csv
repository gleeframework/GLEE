{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while also leaving space for me to earn more than my minimum.  It's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1050000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a better agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
