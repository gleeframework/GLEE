"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, so I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm still within the first few rounds and have plenty of time to negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can push her lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $750,000.  This is a reasonable compromise that still allows for a good profit for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $790,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $790,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay at this point.  While we are getting closer, I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially with more than half of the rounds remaining.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can push her lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $790,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a good profit for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you at $780,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make one final compromise to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $780,000 is very close to my desired price.  At this point, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's unlikely I'll be able to push for a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer allows me to get a good deal on the product and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
