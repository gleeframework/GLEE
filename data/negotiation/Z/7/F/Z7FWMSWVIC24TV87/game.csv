"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still leaves room for you to get a good deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get it for $10,500.  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $10,750.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",10750.0,Alice,5,
