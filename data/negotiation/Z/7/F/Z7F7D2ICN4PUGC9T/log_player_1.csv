Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you can start with a higher price than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $100 allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Maximizing Profit:** If Bob accepts the $100 offer, you've maximized your potential profit. 

**Important Note:** While you have a backup buyer, it's generally good practice to avoid being overly aggressive with your initial offer. A more reasonable starting point increases the chances of a successful sale without the need for lengthy negotiation."
