"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
