Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm confident I can get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  $9,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to accept it."
