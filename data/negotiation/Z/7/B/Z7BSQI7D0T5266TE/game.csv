"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but could we bring the price down closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to bring the price down, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the $11,000 price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
