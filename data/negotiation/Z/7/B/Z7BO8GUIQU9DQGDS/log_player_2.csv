{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his ideal price point.
* While there are only a few rounds left, Bob is unlikely to be able to negotiate further and reach his desired price.
* Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget, ensuring a smooth and stress-free transaction.
* The risk of continuing negotiations and potentially failing to reach a deal within the remaining rounds is not worth it for Bob."
