"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  How about $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the product's true worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
