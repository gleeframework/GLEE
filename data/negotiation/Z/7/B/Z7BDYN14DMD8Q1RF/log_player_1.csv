Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  How about $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firm on his $12,000 offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $15,000."
