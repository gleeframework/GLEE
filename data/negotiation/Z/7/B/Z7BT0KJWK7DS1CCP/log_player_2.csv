"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm starting the price at $10000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, you have a clear target of $15,000 as your maximum.  You should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better deal. You have 10 rounds, so you have plenty of time to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** A counteroffer of $7,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your commitment to getting a good deal. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  This leaves room for some back-and-forth negotiation, allowing you to potentially find a price both parties can agree on. 
* **Keeps Options Open:** You're still open to exploring other options if Alice isn't willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to your target, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has already shown flexibility by moving from $10,000 to $8,500. Continuing to negotiate could potentially bring the price down further. You have 7 rounds left, which is enough time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is closer but still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,000?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Splitting the difference shows you're willing to meet halfway, but still maintains your desire to save money.
* **Maintain Momentum:**  Continuing to push for a lower price keeps the negotiation moving in your favor.
* **Stay Within Budget:** $8,000 is still comfortably within your $15,000 limit, leaving you room for potential future deals if needed."
