"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be extremely valuable for your business.  My initial offer is $1,000,000.  This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from using it.  Let's discuss!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given my budget constraints, I'd like to offer $900,000.  This is still a significant profit for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $950,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for you and gives us room to close the deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing for a healthy profit for you and a good deal for me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum.  To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $940,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for a substantial profit for you and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's finalize this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $940,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm ready to offer $930,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing for a substantial profit for you while meeting my budget constraints. Let's close this deal.",930000.0,Bob,6,
