"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way above your budget and your maximum price point.  You should counteroffer, aiming to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I agree it looks great, $20,000 is considerably more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge her willingness to move on price.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer while firmly stating our position that $20,000 is too high.
* **Target in Mind:** Our goal is to get the product for under $10,000.  Starting at $8,000 gives us some wiggle room to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $14,000 is still above your maximum budget and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be a deal to be made. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have John's offer as a backup, which gives you leverage to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $14,000 is a bit of a stretch for me.  I could potentially go up to $9,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up but Staying Firm:** We're signaling a willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer but are still staying well below her price.
* **Nearing the Limit:** $9,500 is getting close to our maximum budget, creating a sense of urgency and indicating that we're serious but won't overpay.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** John's $10,000 offer is still a viable option if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  While I'm aiming to get closer to my asking price, I can see you're serious about this. How about we settle on $12,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock Approaching:**  Alice is conceding slowly, and you're reaching the point where the potential savings might not justify further negotiation.
* **John's Offer Is Better:**  A $12,000 price tag from Alice is still $2,000 more than John's guaranteed offer.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice takes time and effort. John's offer provides a clean and immediate solution."
