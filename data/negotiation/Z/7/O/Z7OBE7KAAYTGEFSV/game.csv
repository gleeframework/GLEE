"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it provides. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I agree it looks great, $20,000 is considerably more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $14,000 is a bit of a stretch for me.  I could potentially go up to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  While I'm aiming to get closer to my asking price, I can see you're serious about this. How about we settle on $12,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
