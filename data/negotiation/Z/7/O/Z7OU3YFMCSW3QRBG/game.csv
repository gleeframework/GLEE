"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $120 is your limit, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
