"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a favorable outcome.
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and our belief in the offered price, conveying seriousness and setting a firm starting point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While starting high, we signal flexibility and willingness to discuss, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than his perceived value and our initial ask. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving a potential $50,000-$150,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and unlocks the significant potential this product holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We're lowering our price from $1,150,000 to $1,120,000, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value proposition, reminding Bob why he was initially interested and willing to pay above our minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer still keeps us comfortably above our $1,000,000 minimum while leaving room for further negotiation if needed. We're aiming for a win-win scenario where Bob gets a great product at a price he finds reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's still too far below what we believe is achievable. We're willing to negotiate further as long as we're moving closer to a price that reflects the product's true value. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. To show my willingness to close this deal, I'm prepared to offer it for $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're signaling to Bob that this is our final offer to encourage him to seriously consider the deal. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This offer represents a compromise where we've met Bob halfway between our last offer and his.  
* **Emphasize Opportunity:** The message reiterates the value proposition and positions this price as a chance for Bob to gain a significant advantage. 
* **Time Constraint (Implicit):** By introducing a ""final offer"" we create a sense of urgency without explicitly referencing the remaining rounds. This can help push Bob towards a decision. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of Bob walking away.  If he rejects this offer, we're prepared to walk away and sell to John for our guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I respect your position and the value of the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,070,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer, even after presenting our ""final offer,"" shows he's unwilling to meet us at a price that reflects the product's value.  We've made a significant concession, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.  

While we could try to push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob will remain entrenched in his lower valuations, potentially leading to a stalemate. 

Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely, leaving us with nothing after 10 rounds."
