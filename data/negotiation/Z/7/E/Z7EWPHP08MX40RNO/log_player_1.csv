"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while still anchoring the price in a favorable range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,400,000, I'm leaving space to potentially come down in price while still securing a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to acquire the product and how flexible he might be on the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my absolute minimum, it's a significant drop from my initial ask. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. I'm willing to counter-offer and see how Bob responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the value this product brings to the table is much higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach aims for a compromise that feels fair to both parties. By suggesting $1,250,000, I'm splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward while demonstrating my firmness on value.
* **Encouraging a Response:**  By framing the counter-offer as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm hoping to encourage Bob to engage constructively and potentially make a counter-proposal himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could you do $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which shows he's still interested.  We're getting closer to a price I'm happy with. I'll counter-offer again and see if we can find a final agreement point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the immense value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Concession:** I'm reducing my asking price by $50,000, showing Bob I'm flexible and want to find an agreement.
* **Closing Territory:**  This price point represents a strong profit margin for me while still being potentially palatable for Bob. I'm hoping it will encourage him to accept.
* **Clear and Simple:** The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity, aiming for a swift and positive conclusion to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a really intriguing product, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. To make this work on my end, I'd need to get it for $1,175,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Bob is clearly invested in the negotiation and has steadily increased his offers. $1,175,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum, and continuing to push for a slightly higher price could risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a solid offer worth accepting."
