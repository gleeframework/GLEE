Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is $20 more than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also being friendly and encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay $90 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is $10 less than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum of $80. Accepting his offer allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
