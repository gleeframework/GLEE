Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1450000} 

This offer is significantly higher than what I'd accept from John, leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It's also below Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate but not feel like he's being taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to find a price point that works for both of us without compromising my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and is closer to my ideal price point.  I'll accept his offer to secure the sale and avoid potentially losing him to another buyer."
