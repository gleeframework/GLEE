"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,450,000.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's still attractive to Alice, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further, potentially leading to a price closer to Bob's desired range."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what Alice would likely accept.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  The goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but his counteroffer is getting closer to Alice's offer. This indicates that he's willing to compromise, but still wants a good deal.  Increasing the offer by a smaller amount shows a willingness to negotiate while remaining close to his target price."
