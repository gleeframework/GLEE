"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000), and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  While John offers the product for a higher price ($1,500,000), Bob should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000) but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further adjustments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than I believe the product is worth. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get a lower price.  While buying from John is an option, Bob should continue to explore options with Alice before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,050,000?  This would leave us both with a fair profit margin."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. It's a middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice than a much lower offer."
