"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000, you have no incentive to accept her offer. You can get the product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or potentially find another seller offering a better deal."
