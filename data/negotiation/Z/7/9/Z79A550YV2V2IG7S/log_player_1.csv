Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** The offer to John ($1,000,000) acts as a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and inviting further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room for More:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my absolute minimum ($1,000,000), but still significantly lower than his perceived value and my initial asking price. 
* **Negotiating Position:** Rejecting his offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a drastically lower price. This keeps the door open for a potentially better deal.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000 allows me to be firmer in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his offer ($1,050,000) and my previous price ($1,150,000), demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Reaffirming Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Offering a clear counter-proposal keeps the negotiation moving forward and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Potential Loss:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, the difference between Bob's current offer ($1,075,000) and my desired outcome is relatively small. Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away entirely, leaving me to accept John's lower offer. 
* **Securing a Profit:** Accepting $1,075,000 still represents a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. It's a strong deal, even if it's not the absolute maximum I could have achieved. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and utilize the funds sooner."
