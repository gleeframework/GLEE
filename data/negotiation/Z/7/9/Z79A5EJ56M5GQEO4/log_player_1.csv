"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, but I'm prepared to sell to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room for negotiation. While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product and willing to pay something. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, which is closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm aware that selling to John remains a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $13,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Price:** I'm presenting $13,000 as a fair price, highlighting the value of the product while still being open to negotiation.
* **Pressure for a Decision:** I'm encouraging Bob to make a decision by suggesting a specific price and asking for his thoughts.

**Strategy:**

I'm reducing my asking price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to consider my offer.  If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, keeping the option of selling to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $12,000. This still allows us to share the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but it's still not quite there.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a little room to negotiate, as Bob is showing interest and a willingness to move up from his initial offer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  The $15,000 offer from John remains a viable alternative, and I can always choose to sell to him if this negotiation falls through.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm keeping the option of selling to John in mind to ensure I get a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm happy to see you're willing to compromise.  How about $14,000?  That's a fair price that balances our needs and allows us to close this deal.  Let me know if you're ready to make it happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's increased offer and showing a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Fairness:** I'm positioning $14,000 as a fair price that benefits both of us, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting that we're close to a deal and encouraging Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's more favorable to me, while still being reasonable and encouraging Bob to accept. I'm keeping the option to sell to John in mind, but I'm hopeful that we can reach a deal with Bob before I have to go that route."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. I'd like to propose $13,000 as a counteroffer. This still allows us to share the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I'd prefer a bit more, accepting it is a good deal.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We're nearing the end of our negotiation window.  Rejecting and counteroffering could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's offer is still on the table:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, but that's a higher risk because I might miss out on closing a deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation. While it's not ideal, it's a decent outcome considering the limited rounds left and the availability of John's offer."
