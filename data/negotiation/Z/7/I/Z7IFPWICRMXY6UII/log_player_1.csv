Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 for it."", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $130 is less than the $150 Bob is willing to pay. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing you to potentially earn more. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still below your ideal price point. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your asking price of $130 by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $120? That way, we're both happy."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
