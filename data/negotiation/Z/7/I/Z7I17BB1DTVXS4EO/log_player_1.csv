"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you a chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a higher price than your absolute minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Near Bob's Valuation:**  The offer is strategically placed closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than to your minimum ($1,000,000). This might make Bob more receptive than a lower offer.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to establish a collaborative tone by inviting Bob's thoughts and encouraging a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I need to keep my expenses within a certain limit. I am willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still too early to settle. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and there's a good chance you can secure a better deal than $1,000,000. Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate (""Could we meet somewhere in the middle?""), so there's room for you to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, coming down to $1,000,000 represents a significant concession on my end.  Could you meet me at $1,100,000? This would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Compromise:** The message acknowledges Bob's counteroffer and frames your willingness to move from your initial price as a significant step. By proposing $1,100,000, you're aiming for a compromise closer to your initial offer.
* **Fairness:** Highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect aims to appeal to Bob's sense of reciprocity and encourage him to make a move towards your price point. 
* **Continued Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, reinforcing your interest in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. I propose we meet at $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly negotiating and moving towards a more agreeable price. However, there's still room for improvement. You've conceded $50,000, and he's only moved $50,000 from his initial offer. You have time to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer. How about we settle on $1,080,000? This reflects a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1080000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By proposing $1,080,000, you're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,050,000) and your previous counteroffer ($1,100,000). This common negotiation tactic can signal a willingness to compromise and potentially break the stalemate. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message gently reminds Bob of the product's inherent value, subtly justifying your price point while still acknowledging your movement.
* **Time Factor:** You're now past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. While you have time, it's strategic to start aiming for a close soon to avoid risking Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I've considered your last offer, and I think we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now very close to your target price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Trying to squeeze out another $5,000-$10,000 might risk Bob walking away or becoming frustrated, potentially leading to a worse outcome.
* **Time Value:**  While you have rounds remaining, reaching a deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and secures a significant profit above your minimum. 

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,075,000 represents a successful negotiation and a healthy return."
