"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000. Alice's offer of $11,500 is significantly lower.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Time:**  It's likely that continued negotiation will take time.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product quickly. 

At $11,500, Bob saves a substantial amount compared to John's price while still getting a good deal."
