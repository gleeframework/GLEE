Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to earn as much as possible, and you know Bob values the product at $12,000. Starting higher gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firmer with Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message lightly justifies the price by mentioning ""value"" and ""worth,"" potentially making Bob more amenable. 
* **Urgency (Slight):** Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency without being overly pushy.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a less aggressive opening price."
