"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $155? That would be a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
