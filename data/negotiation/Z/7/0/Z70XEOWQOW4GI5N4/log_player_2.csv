{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's not worth it to buy from Alice at that price. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to your budget. However, John is offering the product for $12,000, which is still a better deal. You should reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your initial offer but lower than Alice's last offer. It shows you're willing to meet halfway, but still want a better price than what John is offering."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now equal to what John is offering. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and there is no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price, it's better to buy from John at this point.  You've already tried to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and it hasn't been successful."
