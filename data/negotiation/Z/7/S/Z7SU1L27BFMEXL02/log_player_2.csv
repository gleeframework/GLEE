# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product with considerable value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
