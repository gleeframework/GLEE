"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting at $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is too high. You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and this offer is still significantly above your target range.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation and hopefully reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your own value for the product. Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing you are serious about saving money. It also acknowledges Alice's valuation of the product, while still leaving room for negotiation. This should prompt Alice to consider a lower price, as the counteroffer is significantly closer to her own value of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This price acknowledges the value you place on the product while still allowing me a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still too high for your target. While it's a move in the right direction, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting this offer, you can continue the negotiation and potentially push for a price closer to your desired $900,000 mark."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but are still focused on getting a good deal. It's a smaller step down from Alice's offer than your previous one, indicating you're getting closer to a compromise.  This should encourage Alice to accept your offer as it's closer to her desired profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see we're getting closer.  $950,000 is a good offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my goal.  I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to your target, you are still aiming for a price closer to $950,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000.  This price is fair, and it's the best I can do. Let's close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**
