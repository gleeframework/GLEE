"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting at $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your own value for the product. Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This price acknowledges the value you place on the product while still allowing me a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see we're getting closer.  $950,000 is a good offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my goal.  I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000.  This price is fair, and it's the best I can do. Let's close the deal now.",950000.0,Bob,6,
