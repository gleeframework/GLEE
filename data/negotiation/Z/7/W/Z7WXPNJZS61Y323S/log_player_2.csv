Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've offered a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still higher than my absolute maximum. This gives her room to negotiate while ensuring I'm still within my acceptable range. I've also tried to make my message polite and reasonable to encourage a positive response."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $16,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both place on the product. Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've increased my offer again, showing a commitment to finding a solution.  $15,000 is my absolute upper limit, but it's still a good deal for me compared to John's price. I'm emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit to encourage Alice to consider my offer."
