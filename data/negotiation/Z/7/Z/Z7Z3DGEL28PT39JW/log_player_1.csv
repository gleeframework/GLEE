Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is of high caliber, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,090,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our acceptable range, we still have room to negotiate and secure a better price. We're willing to go lower, but we're aiming for a price closer to $1.1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,105,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we'd ideally like a higher price, we're running out of rounds and Bob is consistently hovering around this price point. Accepting $1,080,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing Bob altogether and having to settle for John's lower offer."
