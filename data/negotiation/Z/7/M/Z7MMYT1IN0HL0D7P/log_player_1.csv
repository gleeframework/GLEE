I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but I'm confident Bob will be interested in the product.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum value and gives Bob a chance to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate further, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $800,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as we are getting close to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value. I've already made significant concessions, and I don't want to risk going lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
