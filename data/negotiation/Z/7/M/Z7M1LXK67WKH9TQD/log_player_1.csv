Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly higher to explore Bob's willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""immense value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. If he outright rejects it, you can always counter with a lower price, getting closer to your minimum acceptable amount.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the time and resources to potentially negotiate with Bob. If you need to sell quickly, a price closer to $1,500,000 might be more practical."
