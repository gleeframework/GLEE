"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. While it's worth a significant amount to me, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price point that reflects its value to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This price allows you to acquire this valuable product at a considerable discount while still ensuring a healthy profit for me.  Let me know your thoughts on this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
