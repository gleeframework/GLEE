Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm open to offers, but my starting price is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $15,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone like ""amazing product"" and ""right person"" aims to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Openness:**  I phrase it as ""open to offers"" to signal flexibility, but also to imply that I'm confident in the product's value.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might need to adjust my strategy. 
* I will keep in mind the $10,000 ""fallback"" offer from John to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss.
* **Counter-offer potential:**  Bob has shown interest, but his price is too low. I can likely secure a better price through further negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't reach a better deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $10,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, but slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. That's a fair compromise given the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a compromise between my initial $15,000 and Bob's $8,000 offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the ""value of the product"" to remind Bob of its worth and justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end the message with ""What do you think?"" to keep the conversation open and invite Bob to counter again.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price without losing out on the potential profit. I'm also staying firm in my negotiation stance while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $10000, so how about $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is just $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, there's a chance I could further negotiate with Bob if I reject his offer. However, this is risky and might lead to a stalemate.
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's slightly less profitable than Bob's offer.

**Decision:**

Given that Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and that further negotiation might be time-consuming and risky, I'm going to **accept Bob's offer** and sell the product for $11,000. This ensures a profitable deal while minimizing the chance of losing a sale."
