"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12000. That's a fair compromise given the value of the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $10000, so how about $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
