"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice or proceeding to purchase from John if necessary."
