Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for negotiation. It's above my minimum value of $800,000, but hopefully, it will entice Bob to make a counteroffer. 

I'll be prepared to negotiate down if needed, but it's important to start with a strong position to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to settle for $700,000, which is below my minimum value. I will counteroffer and aim to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get as close as possible to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to close the deal than risk further negotiation and potentially lose him as a buyer. I'm confident that I've secured a good deal and can now move on to other opportunities."
