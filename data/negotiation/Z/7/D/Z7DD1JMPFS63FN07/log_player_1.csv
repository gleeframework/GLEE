Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for you.  Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This allows for a healthy margin for you while ensuring a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired minimum of $800,000. I have 10 rounds to work with and Bob recognizes the value of the product.  I'll counteroffer and aim to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't fully reflect the value of this product for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. This gives us both a fair return and allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can both find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired minimum of $800,000. I've got a few more rounds to work with. It's worth trying to push for a higher price. I'm willing to risk losing the deal to Bob for now, as I'm confident I can secure a better price in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working with you to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $875,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm prepared to offer a final concession and come down to $890,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}
