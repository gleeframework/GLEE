"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for you.  Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This allows for a healthy margin for you while ensuring a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above what the product is worth to you. There are 9 rounds left to negotiate, providing ample opportunity to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't fully reflect the value of this product for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. This gives us both a fair return and allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to your desired price, but it's still above your comfort zone.  You have 7 rounds left, so you can continue negotiating to try and get an even better deal. There's a good chance Alice will continue to lower her price, especially as you're showing a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can both find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal on this."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working with you to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $875,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm prepared to offer a final concession and come down to $890,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $890,000, which is only $40,000 more than your last counteroffer. With 5 rounds remaining, the chance of getting a better price is diminishing, especially considering Alice mentioned it as her final concession. Accepting this offer saves you $110,000 compared to buying from John, making it the best option at this point."
