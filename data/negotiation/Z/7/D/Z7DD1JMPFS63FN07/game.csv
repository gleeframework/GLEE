"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for you.  Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This allows for a healthy margin for you while ensuring a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't fully reflect the value of this product for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. This gives us both a fair return and allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can both find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal on this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working with you to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $875,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm prepared to offer a final concession and come down to $890,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's make this happen.",890000.0,Alice,5,
