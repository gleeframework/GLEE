"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to anchor the negotiation close to Bob's maximum valuation. By starting high, we leave room for potential concessions while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing our bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing implies willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a multi-round negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is strong, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Rejecting now signals we believe the product is worth more while leaving room to maneuver. We're aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000 and can use the next few rounds to try and get there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm confident this product offers even more value than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  I think this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This classic negotiation tactic signals compromise while keeping us anchored closer to our desired price point.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to emphasize the product's value, subtly justifying our higher price.
* **Fairness:** We're framing this counteroffer as a ""fair"" solution for both parties, hoping to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to suggest a price of $1,375,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,375,000 represents a significant profit margin and is a good deal overall. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, suggesting he's motivated to close the deal. Holding out for more might risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time Value:** We're now in Round 4, and while we have time, a bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Securing a good price now is preferable to dragging out the negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer or losing Bob as a buyer."
