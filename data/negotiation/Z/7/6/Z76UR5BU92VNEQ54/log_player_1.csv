Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he is still far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a number that's agreeable to you within the remaining rounds.  

It's time to cut your losses. You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum price. Accepting John's offer is the most rational decision to maximize your profit."
