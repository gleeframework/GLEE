"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below his maximum budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to her. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $13,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while remaining fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial offer of $14,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer at this point ensures he secures the product while saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
