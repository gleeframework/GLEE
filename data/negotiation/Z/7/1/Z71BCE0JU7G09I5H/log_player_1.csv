{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price slightly above the middle ground. This strategy allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price right away. Bob's offer is too low, and there's room for negotiation. I will counteroffer to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $90?  This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $85 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $85 is still above my minimum and represents a decent profit.  Since Bob is firm on his offer and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, I'll accept Bob's offer."
