"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $14,000.

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000.
