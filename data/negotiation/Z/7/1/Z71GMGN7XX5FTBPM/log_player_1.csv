Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're willing to accept $12,000, so you have room to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's reasonable to ask for a price that's closer to your value than Bob's.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation without risking selling too low. I'm open to adjusting the price depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.  I'm not in a rush and willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to potentially secure a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.  "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is $9,500, which is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss.
* **Lower than my minimum:** This gives me room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Fairly close to the middle:**  It splits the difference between our current positions. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,250. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is still less than my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and Bob's counteroffer seems to be his limit.  It's likely that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable price without spending more time negotiating."
