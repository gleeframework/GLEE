Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating ""I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept a price closer to my initial offer.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's reaction to this first offer will provide valuable insights into his negotiation style and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Rejecting this offer serves two purposes:

1. **Signaling Firmness:** It demonstrates that I'm serious about the product's value and not willing to settle for a low price.
2. **Encouraging Movement:**  It puts the ball back in Bob's court and encourages him to potentially increase his offer closer to my range.

I'm willing to continue negotiating for now, as there's still potential for a deal that's better than selling to John for my minimum. However, I'll need to carefully consider my next counteroffer to bridge the gap without seeming unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly significant. To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):**  The new price is still significantly above Bob's offer and my absolute minimum, preserving room for further negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price point and potentially nudge Bob towards a higher valuation. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Maintain Momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward by showing a willingness to compromise.
2. **Test Bob's Resolve:**  Gauge how serious Bob is about buying and how high he might be willing to go.
3. **Strive for a Win-Win:**  Find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties, but still heavily favors me given the product's value and alternative buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the adjustment, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, given the value you placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could potentially push for more in another round, the risk of losing the deal altogether increases. 

Here's why accepting is the best choice now:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating his strong interest in the product.
* **Potential Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could backfire, leading Bob to walk away or offer a lower price if he senses my desperation.

Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on a profitable sale."
