"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
