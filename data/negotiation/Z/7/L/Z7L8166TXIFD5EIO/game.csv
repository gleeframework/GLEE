"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm ready to offer $1,050,000 for it.  This price is within my range, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still reflects its true value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this incredible product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
