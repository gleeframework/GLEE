"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($80).** 
* **Buying from John is a safe alternative at your desired price point.**  However, you're trying to save as much as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.**  This gives you a chance to negotiate without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $75, which is $5 less than my maximum budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:**  I'm leaving some room for Alice to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm still hoping to avoid buying from John at $80, but I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial goal to get the product from Alice if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget ($80).**
* **Buying from John would save me $5, but that's not a significant enough difference to justify continuing negotiations.**
* **Accepting Alice's offer guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with.** 

While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will further reduce her price. Accepting her offer minimizes risk and ensures I get the product."
