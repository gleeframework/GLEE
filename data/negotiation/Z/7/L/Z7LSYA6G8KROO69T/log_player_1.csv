Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Close to your guaranteed price:** The offer is just below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000). This maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept quickly.
* **Not too aggressive:** While the offer is high, it's not so outrageous that Bob would immediately reject it without consideration. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
