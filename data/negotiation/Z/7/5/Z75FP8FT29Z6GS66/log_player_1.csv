Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will be telling. If he outright rejects it, you know he's looking for a deal closer to his perceived value. If he counters, you'll get a better sense of his price range.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. You're not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to spend no more than $100. Would you be willing to come down to $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is close to his valuation, it's still below your minimum. You have room to negotiate further.  You know John will pay $100, so you're not losing money by continuing the negotiation with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $115, you're showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:**  You've acknowledged his budget concerns but stood your ground on the product's value.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to budge significantly from his initial offer. If he rejects this, you can re-evaluate if further negotiation is worthwhile or if selling to John is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle on $105? That's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $105 is above both your minimum price ($100) and John's standing offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might alienate Bob or lead to a stalemate. It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better offer from him.
* **Secure the Sale:** Accepting now guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
