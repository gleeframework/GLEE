{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm making a profit over my minimum price. I'm aiming for a high initial price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  Let's see how he responds!"
