Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this is a good starting point to gauge his interest. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but I'll also be watching to see if John gets impatient and makes a higher offer than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still do better.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  I'm confident this offer will be appealing to him and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  At this point, $1,750,000 is a good profit, and I don't want to lose that."
