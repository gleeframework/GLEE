"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm on a tight budget.  My final offer is $10,500.  If we can't agree on that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500, Bob. I'm afraid your offer of $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm starting to think it's time to explore other options. However, I'll give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I can offer you a slight discount, and I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. That's the best I can do.",11250.0,Alice,7,
