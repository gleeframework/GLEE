{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is my initial offer. It's important to start high and see if Bob is willing to negotiate up to my minimum price.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $70 is below my minimum price of $100, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with him. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a good offer, it's unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $82. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $82 is closer to my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell him the product."
