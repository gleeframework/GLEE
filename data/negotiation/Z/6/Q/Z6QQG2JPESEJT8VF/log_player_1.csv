Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm offering it at $995,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its potential return on investment for someone like yourself."",
""product_price"": 995000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start the negotiation with Bob significantly higher than his perceived value but just below your guaranteed sale price.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" to frame the price in a positive light, even though it's high for Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. Your goal is to maximize profit, and this starting point gives you the best chance of securing a price significantly above Bob's perceived value. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you prioritize a guaranteed sale to Bob over potentially earning more, you might offer a lower price closer to his perceived value."
