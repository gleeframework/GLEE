Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I offer it to him for $130.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $125. Since this is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($120), I'll decide to reject his offer and make a counteroffer of my own.

I'll offer Bob a price of $128, which is slightly higher than his original offer but still below the price he's willing to pay. This should give me a good chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
