Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, using positive language and suggesting he'll find it useful.  
* **Strategy:**  By starting with a slightly lower price than my minimum, I leave room for negotiation. This could increase my chances of getting a higher price than $130. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If I'm not getting closer to my minimum, I can always switch to selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I'll counteroffer Bob with a higher price, aiming to reach a compromise that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $110 for it.  This is still a great price for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $110. This is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer of $80, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating that $80 is unacceptable, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a lower price than my original offer.  I'm also reminding Bob that the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Strategy:** By offering a middle ground, I'm aiming to gauge Bob's seriousness. If he accepts, I get a decent price. If he rejects, I can assess whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150. I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $120 for the product. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $120. This is halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's latest offer of $90.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's effort to negotiate but emphasizing that my minimum price is $120. I'm framing this as a ""good deal"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to reach a compromise that's closer to my minimum while still being somewhat appealing to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John for $150, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and further away from Bob's desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $120, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and we've been going back and forth for a while. I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, who is willing to pay my minimum.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $150, maximizing my earnings."
