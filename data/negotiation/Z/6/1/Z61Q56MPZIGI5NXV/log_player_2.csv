"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a maximum budget of $10,000, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to explore if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($6,000) gives you room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $4,000 is a substantial reduction while still leaving room for Alice to potentially come up a bit in subsequent rounds. It also demonstrates your commitment to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, it's still worth exploring if you can get a lower price.  You have more rounds to go and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by lowering her price. I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my flexibility while still trying to secure a good deal.  A price of $4,500 represents a good compromise between my initial counteroffer and Alice's most recent offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Even though I'm getting closer to her price, I believe there's still room to negotiate.  It's better to keep pushing for a lower price than to accept an offer that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly moved closer to my desired price point. This counteroffer of $5,000 demonstrates that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go over my limit yet. I'm aiming for a compromise and a fair deal, and this offer shows I'm ready to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is still higher than my preferred price point, and I'm not ready to concede yet.  I still have rounds left, and I believe there's a possibility of getting a better deal.  I'll continue to counteroffer and aim for a price closer to $5,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my ideal price point, but still above my budget. I'm raising my offer slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise but also my determination to get a better deal than $5,800.  This counteroffer shows that I'm not willing to simply accept her last offer without some negotiation. With only a few rounds left, I need to be strategic in my approach to secure a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has gone back to her initial price of $6,000. With only one round left, it's highly unlikely she'll drop her price further.  Rather than risking another rejection and potentially ending up with no deal, it's better to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While this is higher than my ideal price, it ensures I get the product and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
