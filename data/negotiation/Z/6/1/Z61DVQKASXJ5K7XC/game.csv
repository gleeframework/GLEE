"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,325,000. This is a serious compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal at that price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
