"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so any price higher than that is a loss. It is worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,325,000. This is a serious compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can reach a price closer to Bob's $1,200,000 target."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.

Alice has repeated her offer of $1,325,000, indicating she's unlikely to budge further.  While this price is closer to Bob's ideal, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,200,000."
