"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it can be extremely valuable for your business.  I'm asking $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a good price for myself. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $750,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. Would you consider $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to give up my profit margin just yet. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to undervalue the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing conversation and appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $775,000 simply isn't enough for me to let it go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $825,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $825,000. Would you consider $790,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering a price that's below my minimum. While I'm getting closer to his offer, I'm not prepared to sell at such a low price. I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a better offer, but if it doesn't improve, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $790,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to make one more concession and come down to $810,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident that you'll see the value in this product once you have it.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 810000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above $810,000. Would you consider $785,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  It's getting too risky to continue negotiating.  I'm going to sell the product to John.  While it's not the highest price I was hoping for, it's a safe bet to ensure I don't lose out on a significant profit."
