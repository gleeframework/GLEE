"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $70? That would work much better for my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $80. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
