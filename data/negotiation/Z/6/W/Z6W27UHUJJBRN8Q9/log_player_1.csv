Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before it hits the open market. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,500,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a sale above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price. 

This strategy aims to achieve the best possible outcome while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
