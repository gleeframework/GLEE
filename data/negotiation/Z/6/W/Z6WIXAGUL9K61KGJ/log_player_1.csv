Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000 (because selling to John guarantees me this amount)
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $12,000
* **My offer:** $14,000 

This offer is a compromise that:

* **Maximizes my potential profit:** I'm still making more than if I sold to John.
* **Increases the likelihood of Bob accepting:** $14,000 is closer to Bob's valuation than my minimum price.

While I can't be certain Bob will accept, this offer gives me the best chance of securing a sale at a higher price than selling to John."
