"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which I think is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
