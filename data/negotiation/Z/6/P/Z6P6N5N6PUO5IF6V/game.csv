"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to settle around $12,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,500 is close, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would that work for you?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I can do $13,500 was too low, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.",13250.0,Alice,7,
