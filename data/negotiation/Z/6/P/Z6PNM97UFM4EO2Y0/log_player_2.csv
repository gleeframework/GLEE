"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that aligns perfectly with your needs. My asking price is $1,250,000, which represents a significant value proposition for you.  While I have another buyer lined up for $1,500,000, I believe in the potential of a mutually beneficial partnership.  Consider this offer carefully, as it allows for a substantial gain while ensuring a secure transaction for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and what John offers.  You can save $250,000 by going with John.  There's no need to rush into accepting Alice's offer."
