"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident I can find another buyer for $800,000 if you decline.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
