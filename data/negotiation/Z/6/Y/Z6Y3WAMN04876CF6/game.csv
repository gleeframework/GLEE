"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still reflects the substantial value this product brings to your operations.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
