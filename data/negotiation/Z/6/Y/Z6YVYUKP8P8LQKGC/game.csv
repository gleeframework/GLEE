"Dear Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

We look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
