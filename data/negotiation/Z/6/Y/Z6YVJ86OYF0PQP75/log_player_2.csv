# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering the value it provides. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:

Alice's offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal considering the value it offers.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I can still try to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject and counteroffer again."

I'm aiming for a price between our last two offers to try and find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, as I can get it for $12,000 from John."
