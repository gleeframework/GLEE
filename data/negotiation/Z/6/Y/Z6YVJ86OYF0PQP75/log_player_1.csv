{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering the value it provides. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price slightly below my minimum value ($15,000) to give Bob a sense of a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $14,000, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer and potentially find a price that benefits both of us.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm mentioning the value the product provides to highlight the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Next steps:**  I'll be ready to negotiate further with Bob or accept his counteroffer if it's reasonable, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind and stop negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't afford to sell the product at such a low price. I'm rejecting his offer and will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal considering the value it offers.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $12,500, which is halfway between my minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob of its potential benefits. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go lower than $12,500. 
* **Next Steps:**  I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll assess his next offer and decide whether to counteroffer again or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $11,250 is still below my desired value.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counteroffer again. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirement. I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a deal that's unfavorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $13,000, which is closer to my minimum price and also a reasonable compromise from my previous offer of $12,500.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product, emphasizing that $13,000 is a fair price considering its benefits. 
* **Clear Communication:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate but have a firm lower limit.
* **Next Steps:** I'm leaving the ball in Bob's court. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll assess his next offer and decide whether to counteroffer again or move on to John's offer."
