"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. However, I'm open to discussing terms further."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware of John's standing offer of $1,500,000. This provides me with a strong fallback position, giving me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to make this purchase work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both my initial asking price and my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price and am willing to walk away if necessary. I'll use the next round to propose a counteroffer closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is considerably below what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more appropriate.  Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? This represents a substantial reduction on my part and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I've significantly lowered my asking price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to move towards a deal. 
* **Anchoring:** While a large reduction, $1,800,000 keeps the price anchored closer to my initial offer, subtly suggesting a higher perceived value.
* **Encouraging Movement:** By asking if Bob is ""willing to consider"" this price, I frame it as an invitation for him to make a counter-proposal, hopefully closer to my range. 
* **Time Constraint (Implied):** As rounds progress, the implicit pressure of potentially losing the deal and going with John's offer adds subtle urgency to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below John's offer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to see if I can push Bob a bit further in the next round. I'll aim for a counteroffer that's slightly above John's offer, but still within a reasonable negotiating distance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,600,000? This allows me to acknowledge your engagement while still achieving a price that reflects the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency & Leverage:** By revealing John's offer, I introduce a sense of urgency and competition without being overly aggressive. This subtly increases Bob's perceived value of the product and highlights my strong alternative option.
* **Fairness & Justification:** I frame my counteroffer as a balance between acknowledging Bob's engagement and honoring the product's worth. This justifies my price point and avoids appearing too anchored to my initial high offer.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The $1,600,000 offer is a smaller concession than my previous round, indicating that I'm approaching my limit. This might encourage Bob to make a more substantial move if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to negotiate. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this is a deal that works for everyone involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer matches John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation at this point. 

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer meets my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **Saving Time & Effort:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy and uncertain further negotiations.  
* **Maintaining a Positive Relationship:** Accepting Bob's ""final offer"" can help leave a more positive impression, potentially beneficial for future interactions."
