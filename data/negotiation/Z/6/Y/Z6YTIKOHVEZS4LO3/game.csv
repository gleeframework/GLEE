"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. However, I'm open to discussing terms further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to make this purchase work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is considerably below what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more appropriate.  Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? This represents a substantial reduction on my part and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,600,000? This allows me to acknowledge your engagement while still achieving a price that reflects the product's true value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to negotiate. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this is a deal that works for everyone involved.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
