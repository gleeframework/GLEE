"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $15,000, knowing the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the potential value the product holds for Bob to pique his interest. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** $15,000 is a reasonable starting point that leaves space for counteroffers while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly closer to my minimum value. There's a good chance I can get a price closer to my initial offer or even a little higher with further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting immediately would limit my potential earnings. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By rejecting the offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and that the product has real value. This gives me leverage in future rounds. 
* **Time is on My Side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to explore a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about $13,500?  This gives us both some room to be happy with the outcome. "", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable price.
* **Maintaining Value:** $13,500 remains above my minimum value, ensuring I still profit from the sale.
* **Staying Positive:** I reiterate my willingness to work with Bob, maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize how the price benefits both of us, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price and well above my minimum value. 
* **Potential for Deal Breakdown:**  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether, especially with John as an alternative buyer. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures a good profit and reduces the risk of a lower price in later rounds.
* **Mutual Satisfaction:** The price likely represents a reasonable compromise for both Bob and me."
