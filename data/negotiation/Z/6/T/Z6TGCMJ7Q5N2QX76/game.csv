,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about $13500?  This gives us both some room to be happy with the outcome. ",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
