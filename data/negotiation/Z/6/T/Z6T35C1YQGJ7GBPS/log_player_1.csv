Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to move significantly from his budget. While counter-offering could potentially squeeze out a bit more, it's unlikely to bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than John's offer.  Accepting Bob's offer at $750,000 would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  

At this point, cutting losses and securing a guaranteed sale with John is the most profitable decision."
