"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. I'm confident the product is valuable enough to Bob that he'll at least consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my initial offer by countering Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and his offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I'd prefer more, I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further rejection or having to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
