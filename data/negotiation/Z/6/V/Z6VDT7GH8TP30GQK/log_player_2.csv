The product is too expensive at $2,000,000. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for a lower price."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and gives us room to negotiate.  We can adjust the offer based on Alice's response."

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further.  I'm willing to pay more than $1,000,000 but not $1,800,000."

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,500,000. This is my maximum budget and a fair price considering John is also selling for this price."
