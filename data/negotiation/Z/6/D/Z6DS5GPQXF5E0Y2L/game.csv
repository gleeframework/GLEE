"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a bit out of my budget, but I think it's worth it for this product. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. ",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,100? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at this price.",9100.0,Bob,4,
