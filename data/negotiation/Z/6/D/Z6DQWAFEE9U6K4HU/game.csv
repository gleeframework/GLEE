"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $600,000 is far too low.  I understand you want a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a great price for a product worth $800,000 to you. Let's find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could do $700,000.  That's a significant move on my end, and I think it's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is simply not viable for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $900,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
