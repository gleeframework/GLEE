``` 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:**  Alice has stated that $12,000 is her lowest price. This aligns with the information that the product is worth $12,000 to her.
* **You're getting a good deal:** You're getting the product for $3,000 less than John's offer.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** Pushing for a lower price might make Alice walk away, and you'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
