Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By including a message, you open the door for discussion and potential compromise. 

If Bob rejects, you'll be able to gauge his interest and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd ideally like to get. You're in a strong position because you have a backup buyer in John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Test the waters:**  See if Bob is truly willing to go higher or if he's firm on $90.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By showing you're not desperate, you can potentially push Bob to a more favorable price.

**Next Round Strategy:**

Since Bob is clearly interested, you can offer a counter-proposal slightly higher than his $90 offer.  Something like $100-$110 would be a reasonable range to test his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate, but also maintains some of your initial leverage.
* **Appeals to fairness:**  Framing it as a ""fair price for both of us"" can make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Keeps the door open for further discussion:**  The message invites Bob to continue the negotiation if he's still interested. 

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to increase his offer while still leaving you room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is very close to your desired price point. Considering you have a backup offer from John for $80, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice:

* **Maximize your profit:**  $100 is significantly higher than what you'd get from John.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could risk him walking away entirely, leaving you with the lower offer from John.

While you might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, the potential risk of losing the sale outweighs the potential reward. It's best to secure a good price now and avoid further delays or uncertainty."
