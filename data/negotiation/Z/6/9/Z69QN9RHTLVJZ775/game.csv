"I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the concession, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $12,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit higher than your budget, but I'm still confident that the product is worth the investment to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $14,000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product to you with my target profit.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a price of $14,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to you.",14250.0,Alice,5,
