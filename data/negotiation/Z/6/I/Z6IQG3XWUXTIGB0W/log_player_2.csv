"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening counteroffer that demonstrates my seriousness while leaving room for negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, but we'll see if we can reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a better price. I'm also confident that I can get a better deal from John if we don't reach a mutually agreeable price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it well below Alice's offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay her full asking price. It also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still determined to get a lower price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money. Also, John's offer is still a safety net, so I don't feel pressured to accept a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate.  However, I'm still holding firm at a price that's within my budget and less than Alice's offer. This should show her that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not going to overpay.  If she rejects this offer, we're getting close to John's price, and I'm prepared to walk away if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my budget and only slightly higher than John's price.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in smaller price reductions.  I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the product and avoid the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
