**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $1,650,000. While continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, it's risky. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,500,000, which is a significant sum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
