"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $200 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet at $170? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $170 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $120, so how about $145? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",145.0,Bob,4,
