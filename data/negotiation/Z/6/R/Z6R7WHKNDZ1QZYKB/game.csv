"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your budget, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, could you consider $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
