"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget considerations, but $7,500 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle?  I could let it go for $8,750.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,750? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to be within my budget.",7750.0,Bob,4,
