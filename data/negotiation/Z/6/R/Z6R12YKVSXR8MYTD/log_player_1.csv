Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $80 or slightly above won't maximize profit.
* **Below Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $150 from John, so going below that is pointless.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows room for Bob to negotiate up slightly, potentially getting closer to your $150 minimum. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
