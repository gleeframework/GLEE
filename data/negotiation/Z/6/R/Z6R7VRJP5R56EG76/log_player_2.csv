"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's something that I've priced at $1,100,000, considering its potential benefits for your business. This is a fair price that allows for a good margin for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price.
* **You still save money.** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000), it's still within your budget of $1,200,000 and allows you to save money compared to buying from John."
