"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While buying from John for $150 would guarantee you the product, Alice's offer of $140 is a better deal. It saves you $10 compared to John's price and still falls within your maximum budget of $150."
