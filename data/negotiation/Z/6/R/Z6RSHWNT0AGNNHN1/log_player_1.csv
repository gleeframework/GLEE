Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation, but still within the realm of possibility.  This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.  I'm also considering that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his valuation if he truly wants the product.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept it and get some money, it's significantly less than what I value the product at.  I'm going to counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.  If we can't reach an agreement, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price.  It's still above Bob's valuation, but it's also the price John is willing to pay.  This way, I'm not losing out on any potential profit by selling to John. If Bob doesn't accept, I can move on to John without any further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $900,000, which is closer to my desired price and closer to John's offer.  While I'd prefer to get $1,000,000, accepting this offer guarantees me a profit.  There's always a chance Bob will reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale."
