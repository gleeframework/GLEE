"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's meet halfway.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we can find common ground. How about we aim for $825,000? This would allow us to strike a fair deal while staying within my financial limits.",825000.0,Bob,4,
