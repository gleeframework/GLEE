Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and offers you a significant return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, Bob values the product higher. Our goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring we earn significantly more than our fallback option.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential return on investment, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
