"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $9,500, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
