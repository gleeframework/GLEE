{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, suggesting that the price is fair considering his potential gains.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer allows for negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to counter without immediately resorting to selling to John. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open for a potentially higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is lower than my starting point:**  His offer of $1,100,000 is still below my initial offer of $1,150,000. This means I have room to negotiate further.
* **Potential to get closer to my target:** I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his counteroffer and making my own counteroffer.
* **Avoiding settling for less:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a loss compared to Bob's offer. However, I have a higher target in mind.

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I keep the negotiation open and maintain the leverage to potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident it will be a wise investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm proposing a compromise by offering a price in the middle between my previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.
* **Keeping it open:** This counteroffer leaves the door open for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling to meet my price. 

By splitting the difference and emphasizing the product's value, I aim to reach a compromise that is mutually beneficial and potentially leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further negotiation, but there's a risk that he might walk away entirely.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  My counteroffer might be rejected, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price.

While $1,075,000 is not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that secures a sale and avoids risking a lower offer from John."
