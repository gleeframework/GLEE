Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, making the price seem more attractive. 

By offering a high price initially, I create a good starting point for negotiations and maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is Higher:** I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000, and Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  By rejecting, I show I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price far below my initial offer. This encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round.

I believe I can potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a good compromise and still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,500.
* **Middle Ground:** This new offer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $10,500 is still a good deal.

By offering a counter-offer closer to my desired price, I continue to work towards a favorable outcome without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my previous offer of $10,500. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  We've already been through several rounds, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly higher price.

While $9,750 isn't my ideal price, it's a good compromise and ensures I don't lose out on a potential sale for a small difference."
