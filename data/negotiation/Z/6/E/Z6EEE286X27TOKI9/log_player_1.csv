"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a starting point that is above your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It signals that you are serious about selling the product to Bob, but also that you are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is your minimum, Bob's offer is too low considering the product's value to him.  Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation and the possibility of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is slightly lower than your initial offer, acknowledging Bob's counter-offer. It still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and while there's still room for negotiation, it's not clear if we'll be able to get a better price.  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is our minimum and ensures we don't lose out on any potential profits."
