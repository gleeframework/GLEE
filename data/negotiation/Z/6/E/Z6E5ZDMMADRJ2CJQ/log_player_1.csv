Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) because I want to maximize my profit. This offer is also higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit. This offer is a good middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him. Selling to John would guarantee me a higher price, but I'm prioritizing getting the deal done."
