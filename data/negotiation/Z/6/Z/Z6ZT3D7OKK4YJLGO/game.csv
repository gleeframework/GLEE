"I'm excited to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than the market value of $1500000 that I could sell it to another buyer for. I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer of $1200000 and your offer of $900000. I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that balances your desire for a good deal with my need to make a profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your target budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1200000. I'm offering you the product for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
