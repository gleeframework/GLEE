"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1,000,000. It's a steal, considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows for negotiation room and signals the value you place on the product. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to engage.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's ""true value"" subtly implies there's a potential for a higher price than $800,000, but without revealing your minimum. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. This first offer sets the stage for the negotiation and allows me to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my ideal target.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room to push for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with further negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to explore better options and potentially get a price closer to my initial offer.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation. I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating my commitment to getting a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price higher than Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying the higher price.
* **Framing as a ""significant compromise"":**  This creates a sense of urgency and reinforces the idea that this is a good deal for both parties.

**Strategy:**

By making a small concession, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward.  This counteroffer is designed to be enticing to Bob while still leaving room for potential further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $960000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is only $15,000 less than my ideal price of $975,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly higher price, and there's a chance Bob could lower his offer further.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk reaching the end of the negotiation without a deal.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer is a calculated risk, but it's the most logical choice at this point. It secures a price that's close to my goal and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether. I'm willing to compromise slightly for the certainty of a sale."
