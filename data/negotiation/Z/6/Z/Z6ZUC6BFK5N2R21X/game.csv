"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $12000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to getting this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9500 at this point. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9500 is a competitive offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'll meet you halfway again and offer you a price of $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but $11000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would make this deal happen.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to sell at $10000. I'll offer you a price of $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're very close. I understand you're not willing to go lower than $10500, but I'm still only able to offer $10000. It's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with John.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $10000. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll offer you a price of $10200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,9,
