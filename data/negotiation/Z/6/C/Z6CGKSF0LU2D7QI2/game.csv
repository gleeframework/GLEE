"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you sharing this unique product with me. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10500 for the product. It's a great compromise, considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $9000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while fitting within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10000, which is my minimum price, but I'll throw in a special bonus package worth $500 to sweeten the deal. This way, you'll get the product and the bonus package for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
