"I'm interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $650000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $725000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $675000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I'll offer it to you for $690000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. If you're still not satisfied, I'll have to reconsider other options.",690000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $690000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $680000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",680000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $690000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $690000.",690000.0,Alice,9,
