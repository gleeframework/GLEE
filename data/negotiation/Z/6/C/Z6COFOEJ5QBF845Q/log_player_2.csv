"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $800,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While $750,000 is a decent price and saves me money, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and might be willing to go even lower. I'll counter-offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  This leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, which is good. While $725,000 is a better offer, I'll push a little further. There's still a gap between her offer and my ideal price. I'll counter-offer with a smaller increase to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $680,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 680000}

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. This keeps the negotiation moving and potentially avoids stalling the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $680,000. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000, which is a compromise that still benefits both of us. This is the last offer I'm willing to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. While not as low as I'd hoped, $715,000 is a reasonable compromise. It saves me a decent amount compared to John's price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
