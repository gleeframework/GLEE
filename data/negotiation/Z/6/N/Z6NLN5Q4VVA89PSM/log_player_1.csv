Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and I can potentially still meet my minimum price of $150.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
