"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. While I'm interested, that price is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1075000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1075000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, considering my other options. I'm happy to meet you at $1025000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1060000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
