Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

This is a good point to take the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $975,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum ($800,000).
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob indicating this is his final offer suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing negotiations risks a stalemate or getting a worse offer in later rounds.  

While you might be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's $800,000 offer is too high."
