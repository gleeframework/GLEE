"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target budget of $10,000 as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $7,500, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer that's still below Bob's target budget, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $8,750? This is still well within your budget and closer to the value I'm aiming for. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above my target budget, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8,200? I'm willing to make a small sacrifice to get the product, but I'd like to stay as close to my budget as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $8,200 is a good compromise that's both within my minimum acceptable price range and closer to Bob's budget.  This ensures a successful transaction and avoids the risk of a further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
