"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering how much value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 isn't a terrible price, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. Alice is starting quite high above her own valuation of the product. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can purchase from John for $15,000."
