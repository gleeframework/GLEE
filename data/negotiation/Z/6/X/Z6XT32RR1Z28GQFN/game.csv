"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe a price of $400,000 would be more reflective of a fair deal.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $400,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stay within. I can go up to $450,000.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. I'm offering a counteroffer of $500,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",500000.0,Alice,5,
