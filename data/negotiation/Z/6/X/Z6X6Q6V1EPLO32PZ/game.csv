"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it can be a great fit for your business. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to recoup some of your investment, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my initial price. Let's settle on $1,375,000. This would still be a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product at a significant discount compared to my initial offer.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,375,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
