Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($120),  but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob and suggest it's a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Safety Net:** I have the option to sell to John for $120 if Bob rejects my offer.

**This strategy allows me to:**

*  Get a decent price while still appealing to Bob.
*  Leave room for negotiation if necessary.
*  Maintain the option of selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could try to get a higher price by rejecting and counteroffering, it's risky. Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with having to sell to John for $120.
* **Negotiation Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation rounds. 

**It's better to secure a decent profit now than risk losing a sale altogether.**"
