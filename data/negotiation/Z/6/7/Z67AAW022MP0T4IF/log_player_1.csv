"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90.  This is a compromise, lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on $80, and we're already at round 4. I've already made a counteroffer and I'm not sure how much further I can go. To avoid risking getting stuck at $80, I'm going to sell to John for $80. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting stuck in a stalemate."
