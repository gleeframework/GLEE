"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $17,000, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me a decent profit.  I want to see if he's willing to come up significantly to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $11,000,  I'm holding out for more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price since I can sell to John for that amount. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $15,000. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $14,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping that this offer will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
