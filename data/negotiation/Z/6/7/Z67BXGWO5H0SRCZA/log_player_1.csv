"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation. I'll sell the product to John for a guaranteed $150."
