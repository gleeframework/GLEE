"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is a good price, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $11,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $12,250.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to the $11,000 mark.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000 from John, he's not in a rush to accept Alice's offer."
