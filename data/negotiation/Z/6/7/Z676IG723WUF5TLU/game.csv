"Alice,  $13,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $11,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $12,250.  This is my final offer.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While $12,250 is a good compromise,  I'm still only comfortable at $11,500.   This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look at other options.",11500.0,Bob,4,
