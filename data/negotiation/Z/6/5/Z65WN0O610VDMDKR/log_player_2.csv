"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still above his maximum budget.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it is still higher than his ideal price from John, it's within his budget and a good compromise given the negotiation.  It's likely that continued negotiation will only result in a lower price from Alice, but possibly not low enough to beat John's offer."
