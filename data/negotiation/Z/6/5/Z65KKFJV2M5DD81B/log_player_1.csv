Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I want to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can counter-offer and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile.  How about $13,800?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal right now."", ""product_price"": 13800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,800 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting close to my desired range.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
