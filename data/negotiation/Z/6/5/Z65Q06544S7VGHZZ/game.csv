"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I need to ensure it makes financial sense for me.",850000.0,Alice,5,
