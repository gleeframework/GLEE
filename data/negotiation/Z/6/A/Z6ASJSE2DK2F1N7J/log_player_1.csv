Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it. This reflects the value I see, and leaves room for us to potentially work out a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
