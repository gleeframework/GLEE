"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it. This reflects the value I see, and leaves room for us to potentially work out a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This recognizes the value you see while still reflecting what I need to make this deal work.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
