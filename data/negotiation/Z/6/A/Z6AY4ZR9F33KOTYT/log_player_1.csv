"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We want to anchor the negotiation high. Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so starting near that figure establishes a strong position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,300,000 gives us space to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a final price significantly above our minimum ($800,000).
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as a potential win for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, it's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,200,000. We're not in a rush, so rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving in a favorable direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. Considering the unique value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $1,300,000 to $1,175,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, we're not meeting him in the middle.  This counter-offer still keeps us above the halfway point between his initial offer ($1,000,000) and our starting price ($1,300,000).
* **Justification:**  We continue to emphasize the value proposition, justifying the price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I could go up to $1,050,000, but that's really pushing my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's latest offer is still below our desired outcome.  We'll use our next counteroffer to signal a willingness to negotiate in smaller increments, but we're not going to accept anything below $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle on $1,125,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We're coming down by $50,000 this time, indicating we're nearing the bottom of our negotiating range.
* **Strong Position:** $1,125,000 is a strong position, halfway between his last offer and ours. 
* **Confident Tone:** We want to project confidence that this is a fair deal, without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to stretch a bit further to $1,075,000.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in a classic negotiation standoff. Bob is moving in smaller increments, but we still have some leverage. We're willing to go down a bit more, but we need to signal strongly that time is a factor and we have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer, and I need a decision today: $1,100,000.  I have another interested buyer who's ready to move forward at my minimum price, but I believe you're the ideal fit for this product."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear this is our best and final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Introducing Competition:** Mentioning another buyer subtly increases pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Reaffirming Value:** We're reminding Bob why he was interested in the first place, subtly appealing to potential loss aversion (losing out on a valuable product).
* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm at $1,100,000, a strong price that reflects a good balance between maximizing profit and the risk of losing the deal."
