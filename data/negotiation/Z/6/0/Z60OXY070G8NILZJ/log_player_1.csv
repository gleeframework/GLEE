Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to make even more profit from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is still significantly beneficial to you (a $150,000 gain). 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept a price he might otherwise negotiate down further. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Framing the sale this way appeals to Bob's potential desire for a unique deal.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale without needing to wait for John."
