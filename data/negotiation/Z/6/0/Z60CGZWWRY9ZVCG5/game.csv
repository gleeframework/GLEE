"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find a buyer quickly.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $90 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle at $105. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it a great deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
