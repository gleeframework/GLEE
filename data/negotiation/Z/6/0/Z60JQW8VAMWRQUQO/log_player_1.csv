Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through. 

This approach allows me to potentially maximize my profits while keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $8,500 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. While I am open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that is so far below my bottom line. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and continue exploring a potential deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $8,500 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,000, which would still be a great deal for you considering the value it offers.  What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely shutting him down.  
* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to potentially encourage him to compromise. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation. 

This counteroffer helps me move towards a mutually acceptable price while staying above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to move on to John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $15,000. Bob has clearly stated that this is his final offer, and if I reject it, he will go to John.  

By accepting his offer, I secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing out on the $15,000 from John.  This is the most rational choice in this situation."
