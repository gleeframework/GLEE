"Hey Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $8,500 right now.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $8,500 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,000, which would still be a great deal for you considering the value it offers.  What do you think? ",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to move on to John's offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
