"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still a little high for me. I'm very serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
