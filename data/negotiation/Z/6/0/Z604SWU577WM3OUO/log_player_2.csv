"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price lower. By rejecting, he can explore a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $13,000 for the product. This price would still be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $13,750, which is only $250 more than Bob's counteroffer of $13,500.  This is a small difference, and Bob should consider the following:

* **Risk:**  Rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate could result in Alice getting frustrated and refusing to sell.  
* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate could take additional time.
* **Alternative:** John's price is still higher at $15,000.

Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
