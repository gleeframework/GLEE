"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $80, it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to your $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to offer $90, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
