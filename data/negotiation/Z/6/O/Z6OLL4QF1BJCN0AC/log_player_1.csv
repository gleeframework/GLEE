""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy it for $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for the middle ground between Bob's valuation and your minimum ($1,500,000 - $800,000 = $700,000 potential profit).  Splitting the difference means aiming for around $1,150,000.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers and making it a one-time offer, you increase the perceived value and encourage a quick decision.

Offering the product at $1,250,000 gives Bob a substantial saving while still netting you a significant profit over your fallback option."
