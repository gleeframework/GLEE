"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I'm confident it's a perfect fit for your needs.  To start, I'm offering it for $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $1,300,000 isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This allows both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,275,000?  That's a significant move on my part while still acknowledging the value of your product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,275,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both room to work with. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I could make this work for $1,287,500. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my budget. What do you say?",1287500.0,Bob,6,
