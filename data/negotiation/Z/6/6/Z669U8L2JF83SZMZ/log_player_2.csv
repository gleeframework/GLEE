"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can push Alice closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a little less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is well within your acceptable range. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is high. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids any potential complications with further negotiations."
