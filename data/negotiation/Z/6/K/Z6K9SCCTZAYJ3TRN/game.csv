"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product,  $20000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I cannot accept $10000 due to the production costs and the value I place on the product. I propose a counteroffer of $15000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the quality and uniqueness of the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and budget.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $12000.  I believe this reflects a reasonable compromise, given the value I place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle.

I hope this aligns better with your budget while still compensating for the value I place on the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
