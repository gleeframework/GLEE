Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While I have John as a backup, I don't want to reveal that to Bob. Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 gives me leverage, but Bob doesn't need to know that. 
 
This offer aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider."
