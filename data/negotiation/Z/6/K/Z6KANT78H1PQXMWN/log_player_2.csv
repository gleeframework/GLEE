I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that John is offering the product for a much lower price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm prepared to walk away if the deal doesn't get closer to my desired price."
