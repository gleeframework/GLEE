"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,800,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product, which reflects a fair price considering my value for it. I'm confident this offer is mutually beneficial and allows for a smooth transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This price is a fair compromise and reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,550,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
