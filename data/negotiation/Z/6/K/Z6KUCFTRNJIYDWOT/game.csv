"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me on that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I consider fair value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This represents a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
