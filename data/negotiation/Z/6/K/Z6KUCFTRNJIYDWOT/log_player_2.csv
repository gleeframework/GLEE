"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is above his budget and he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me on that."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I consider fair value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This represents a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it's a better offer than her initial one, it's still not as good as the deal Bob can get from John."
