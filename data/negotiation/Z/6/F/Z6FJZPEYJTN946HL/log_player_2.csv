"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,350,000 is more than Bob's maximum price, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves some room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while still giving me a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,250,000 is still more than Bob's maximum price, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John. John's price is only $50,000 more than Bob's counteroffer, so Bob should try to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,175,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'll lower my price to $1,225,000. This is a fair offer that considers both our needs, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's reach an agreement now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,225,000 is closer to his target price, it's still higher than his maximum price.  He has a better chance of getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by buying from John. John's price is only $25,000 higher than Bob's counteroffer, so Bob has room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,225,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
