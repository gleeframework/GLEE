Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a slightly higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate if needed and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing, you subtly imply the price might increase or it might sell quickly elsewhere, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a perceived benefit of an early deal."
