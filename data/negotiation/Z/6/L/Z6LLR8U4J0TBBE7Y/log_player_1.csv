Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give me valuable information. If he accepts, I've maximized my profit. If he negotiates, I know he's interested but wants a better deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
