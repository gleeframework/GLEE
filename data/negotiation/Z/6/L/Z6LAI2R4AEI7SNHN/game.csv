,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
