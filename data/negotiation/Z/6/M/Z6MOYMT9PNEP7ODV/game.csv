"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $1,100,000 at this time.  I'm confident this product will be valuable for my business, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still reflects the significant value this product provides.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
