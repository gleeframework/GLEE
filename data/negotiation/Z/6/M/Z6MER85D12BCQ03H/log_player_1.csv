Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still ensuring Bob gets a deal ($10 profit for him). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
