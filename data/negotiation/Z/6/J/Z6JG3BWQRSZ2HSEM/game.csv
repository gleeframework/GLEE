"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price is a little high for my budget. I could consider a price closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the price is a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we settle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget constraints and the product's value to your business.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it $825,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $862,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget constraints.",862500.0,Alice,7,
