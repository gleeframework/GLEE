"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You value the product at $120 and Alice is offering it for $100, which is a good deal for you.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer would mean buying from John for $120, which is less desirable.**"
