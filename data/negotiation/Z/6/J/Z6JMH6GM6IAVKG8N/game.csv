,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $10500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9800.  Let's try to close this deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we try $10200?",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns. $10200 is still a bit higher than I want to go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer. How about we close the deal at $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer, just like you suggested, but I need to make $10200. This is my final offer.",10200.0,Alice,9,
