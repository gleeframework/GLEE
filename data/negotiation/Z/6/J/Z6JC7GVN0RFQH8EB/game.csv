"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500. I'm serious about acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your seriousness about acquiring the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10800. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10200.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10600. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",10600.0,Alice,5,
