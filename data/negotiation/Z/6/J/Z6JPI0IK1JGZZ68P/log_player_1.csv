{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he's likely to counteroffer. This strategy allows for a potential middle ground.
* **Setting a clear price:**  A specific price helps keep the negotiation focused. 
* **Positive and friendly tone:**  A friendly approach can help build rapport and encourage a successful outcome. 

I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware of my fallback option with John, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's interest is clear, and he's willing to negotiate.
* **Holding out for a better price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get closer to my ideal price point in the next round.

I'm not willing to sell at Bob's initial counteroffer, but I'm also not ready to walk away just yet.  I'll try to negotiate a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand you're looking for a great deal, $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,750?  This price still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By offering $10,750, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Focusing on value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Staying firm:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer but showing I'm open to negotiating a fair deal. 

This counteroffer is a step towards reaching an agreement while still maintaining my bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $10,500 is not ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away, leaving me with only the $10,000 offer from John.
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely it is that something could change or that Bob will lose interest.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that's almost as good as my minimum.  It's the best option considering the risk of losing the deal entirely."
