Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:

While I could try to haggle further, $87.50 is a reasonable compromise. It's getting close to the point where the potential savings aren't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
