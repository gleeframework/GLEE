Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies that the price is justified without directly stating it's worth more to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests willingness to hear Bob's thoughts, leaving room for potential counter-offers.

While Alice knows she has John as a backup, aiming higher with Bob initially could lead to a better profit margin."
