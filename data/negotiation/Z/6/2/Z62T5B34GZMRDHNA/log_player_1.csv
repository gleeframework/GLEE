Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, the negotiations are progressing slowly. It's unlikely Bob will meet the $15,000 mark I need. Selling to John guarantees I get the minimum acceptable price."
