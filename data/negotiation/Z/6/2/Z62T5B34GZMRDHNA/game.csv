"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $12,500? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,6,
