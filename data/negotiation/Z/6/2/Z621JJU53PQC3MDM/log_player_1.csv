Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $115.  While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob at $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum price, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to convince Bob to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $118 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  Selling to John for $120 ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
