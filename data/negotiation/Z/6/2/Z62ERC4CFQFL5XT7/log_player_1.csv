"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground for Bob and me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial goal, it's a good price considering the limited number of rounds. It's also closer to my minimum value than what John is offering."
