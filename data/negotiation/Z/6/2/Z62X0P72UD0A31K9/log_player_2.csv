# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is simply out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
