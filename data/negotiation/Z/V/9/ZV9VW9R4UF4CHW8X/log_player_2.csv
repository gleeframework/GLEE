"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking to get at least $1,200,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think?

Alice is now willing to sell at my maximum price. It's best to accept and avoid the risk of her retracting this offer."
