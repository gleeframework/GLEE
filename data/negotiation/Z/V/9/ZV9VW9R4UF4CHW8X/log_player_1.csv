Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking to get at least $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you be willing to come down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
