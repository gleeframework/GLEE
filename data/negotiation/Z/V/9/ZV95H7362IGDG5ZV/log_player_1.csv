Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $150.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the product's value to Bob ($100) and her minimum acceptable price ($100). She also has a backup buyer (John) willing to pay her minimum price.  Therefore, Alice should aim higher than $100.

Starting at $150 allows room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can gradually lower the price, moving closer to Bob's valuation while still aiming to maximize her profit."
