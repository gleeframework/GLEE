Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know is of significant value to you. I believe a price of $14,000 is fair considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A slightly lower offer ($14,000) leaves room for Bob to negotiate or accept immediately, feeling like he got a good deal.
* **Secure a Sale:**  Offering a price significantly lower than $15,000 might raise Bob's suspicion or make him think the product is flawed.  This price point balances profit with the certainty of a sale, as we have John as a backup buyer at $10,000."
