"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, so I'll reject it and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This way we both get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, so I'll reject it and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still below what I need to get. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $97.50. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, his offer of $97.50 is still below my minimum price of $100.  The risk of going through more rounds is too high.  I'm better off selling to John for $150 and ensuring I get a good price for my product."
