{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product but below your minimum desired price.  It allows for some room for negotiation and increases the likelihood that Bob will engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while also allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, I am still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's true value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1,125,000 as a counteroffer for your product. I believe this price is fair and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, and the potential for further negotiations seems limited. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, but the potential for further concessions from Bob is minimal.  Accepting Bob's offer of $1,125,000 ensures a quick sale and a decent profit, though it's slightly below my ideal price."
