You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal, potentially pushing Alice to lower the price closer to her valuation."
