Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you with room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you are confident in your product's value.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's reaction and your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to meet him in the middle, doing so would mean selling the product significantly below your minimum acceptable price. It's better to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to your initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  You are still in a strong position.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to continue to try and get a better price."
