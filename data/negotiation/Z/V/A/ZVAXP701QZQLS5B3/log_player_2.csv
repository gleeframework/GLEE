"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's price of $100, you can still try to get a better deal from Alice. There's room to negotiate before resorting to buying from John."
