Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with an offer above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to your desired minimum ($15,000). 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Mentioning other interest (""interest I've had"") and a potential public listing might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the phrasing ""proposing a price"" suggests openness to discussion if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired minimum, so you're not losing out completely."
