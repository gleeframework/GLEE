{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and friendly:** I'm using positive language and showing confidence in the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly asking for Bob's opinion, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, my budget for this purchase is strictly limited to $15000. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $18,000.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, $15,000 is a bit lower than what I can accept. However, I'm willing to come down to $16,500. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's budget:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations, showing understanding and maintaining a positive tone.
* **Counter-offering with justification:** I'm proposing a counteroffer of $16,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.  I justify the price by emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end the message with a question, keeping the negotiation open and inviting further discussion. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise that is both fair and profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $15000 for the product. Could we possibly meet at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $15,000, and I've already counter-offered once. While $15,000 is less than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's important to consider:

* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and might not lead to a higher offer from Bob.
* **Risk:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away entirely, forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $15,000 is the most sensible decision. It secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
