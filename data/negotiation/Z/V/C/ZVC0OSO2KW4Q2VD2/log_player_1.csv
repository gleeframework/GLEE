"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again. $14,000 is closer to my goal, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to $15,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $15,500? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $15,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
While $14,500 is close to my goal, I'm worried that further negotiation with Bob might drag on and I might not be able to get my desired price. Since John is offering me my minimum price of $15,000, I'm going to sell to him to avoid further risk and ensure a guaranteed profit."
