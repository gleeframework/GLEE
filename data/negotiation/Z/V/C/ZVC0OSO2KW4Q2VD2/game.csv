"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $15,500? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $15,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,6,
