"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $15,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $15,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000.  Would you be open to that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best price, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. $14,000 is tempting, but I'm trying to stay closer to $13,500. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  I'm going to stick to $14,000. This is a fair price for the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.  Let's close this deal at $14,000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I may have to consider other offers.",14000.0,Alice,7,
