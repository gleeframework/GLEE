{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I also don't want to undervalue my product. We can adjust the price based on his response and the negotiation that follows."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than what John would pay, I'm aiming for a higher price. Bob clearly values the product, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm getting closer to my desired price point. I'm confident that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob than selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000, and I believe there's a good chance Bob will accept this offer."
