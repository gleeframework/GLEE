Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the higher price, even though you know Bob values it lower. 
* **Gauge Interest:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you open the door for him to counter-offer, revealing how interested he truly is.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects this price, you have the security of John's offer, allowing you to potentially negotiate down closer to Bob's perceived value without going below your minimum."
