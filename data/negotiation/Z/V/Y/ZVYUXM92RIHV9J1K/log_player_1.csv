Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $110 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, informing Bob about the product and my desired selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is above my minimum price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob. His counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than $80, but less than my initial ask. I'll counter with a price closer to $100 to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $100, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how much more Bob is willing to pay. If he accepts, it's a win. If he rejects, I'll have more information to decide my next move. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  The message aims to keep the negotiation collaborative and agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, Alice, but $100 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $95 is a good price, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and a fair deal considering Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but it also risks losing the sale altogether. Accepting now secures a good profit. 
* **Relationship Building:**  Accepting Bob's offer shows flexibility and can help build a positive relationship for potential future transactions."
