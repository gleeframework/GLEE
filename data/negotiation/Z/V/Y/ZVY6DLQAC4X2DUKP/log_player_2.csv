"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to Bob, so Alice's offer is too high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Bob's maximum value. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still maintaining a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum value, but it's closer. Rejecting allows for more negotiation to potentially achieve a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum value, but still wants to save as much as possible. Offering $1,400,000 is a compromise that shows willingness to negotiate while still keeping some room for Alice to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum value, but it's getting very close.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a slightly lower price.  He might be able to get Alice to meet him at $1,500,000, but there's always a chance she'll reject his counteroffer and then he'd have to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is Bob's final offer. He's willing to pay his maximum value for the product, but he won't go any higher.  If Alice rejects this offer, he'll buy from John."
