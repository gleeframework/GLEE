Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering its potential for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair and reflects the product's worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  What do you say?

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable amount, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed offer from John."
