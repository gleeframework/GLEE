Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, leaving room for negotiation.  This should give Bob some incentive to counteroffer, hopefully allowing us to settle on a price that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum price.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  How about $8,500?  It's still a great price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try to reach a middle ground in the next round.  While John is a safe option, I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still trying to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $6,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum price.  I've already made a concession and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too low.  I'll sell to John for $8,000, which is my minimum price and a safe bet."
