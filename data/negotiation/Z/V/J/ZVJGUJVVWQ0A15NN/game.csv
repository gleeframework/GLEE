"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1500000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
