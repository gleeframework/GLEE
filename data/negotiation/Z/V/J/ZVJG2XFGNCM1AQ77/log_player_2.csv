"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm only offering this price to you because I believe in the potential of our partnership.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. There's a good chance you can negotiate with Alice to get a lower price, closer to her $800,000 valuation."
