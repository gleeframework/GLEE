"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. It's a good product and I'm sure you'll value it.  How about $10,500? This is a fair compromise and it will allow us both to walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you have your budget, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,150.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10150.0,Alice,7,
