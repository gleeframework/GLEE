Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, giving you a good profit, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to my initial offer of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $95. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not as high as I initially hoped, it's still a good profit for me and avoids the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
