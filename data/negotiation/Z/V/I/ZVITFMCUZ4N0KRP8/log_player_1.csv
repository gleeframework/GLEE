"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is better than my minimum, it's still below the value I'm aiming for. I believe I can negotiate a higher price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher and potentially reach a price that's closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I hope this will push him closer to my desired price while demonstrating my commitment to closing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm committed to seeing this negotiation through, and I'm hoping Bob will come closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,850,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still reflects my desire to achieve a higher price than Bob's offer. It shows I'm flexible but determined to close a deal that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for a higher price, we're running out of rounds. Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a respectable amount, and I believe it's the best I can get at this point.  It's a significant profit over my minimum value and it's important to close the deal before risking losing both Bob and potentially John as buyers."
