"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for at $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is closer to my minimum price. Can we agree on that?",9250.0,Alice,5,
