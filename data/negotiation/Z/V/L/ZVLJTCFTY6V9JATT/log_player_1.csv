``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive, as it's lower than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm sticking to my guns and offering $13,000. This is only $500 more than Bob's last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet him halfway again, but this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay closer to my desired price. I'm running out of bargaining power and the negotiation seems to be dragging on.  Selling to John guarantees me a solid $10,000, which is still a worthwhile profit and avoids further risk of losing the sale entirely."
