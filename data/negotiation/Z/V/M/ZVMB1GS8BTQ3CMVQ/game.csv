"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $95 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to come up just a little bit to $98?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $98, which would be $96.50. Can you consider this offer?",96.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! How about we split the difference again and go with $97.25? It's a fair compromise and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good price for the product. What do you think?",97.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $97.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $96 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",96.0,Bob,8,
