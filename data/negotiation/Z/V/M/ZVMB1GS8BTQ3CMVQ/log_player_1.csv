"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value. This will give me room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer. I'm also being friendly and confident in my message, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $100 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$95 is closer to my goal, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $95 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to come up just a little bit to $98?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $98, which would be $96.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting close to my goal of $100, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's not a huge difference, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a little bit more.  I'm not sure how many rounds are left, but I think I have time for a few more counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! How about we split the difference again and go with $97.25? It's a fair compromise and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good price for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 97.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $97.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $96 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get Bob to agree to a price closer to my goal.  To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
