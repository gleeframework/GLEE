Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a price point that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as beneficial for both parties, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

**Why not higher?**

* Going too close to $1,500,000 risks immediate rejection. Bob needs to feel like he's getting a deal too. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your bottom line is $1,200,000 (John's offer)."
