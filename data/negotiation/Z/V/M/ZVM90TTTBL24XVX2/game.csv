"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My budget is $8,000 for this product. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000.  However, that's still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground there.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer of $9,000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is my best and final offer in this range, but I'm willing to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement here.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, but $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it allows me to stay within my spending limits.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you the product for $10,250. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",10250.0,Alice,7,
