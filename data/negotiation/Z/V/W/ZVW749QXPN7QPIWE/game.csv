"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would allow us both to make a fair profit.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute top. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product's value to you justifies this price. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I'm confident it's worth it.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
