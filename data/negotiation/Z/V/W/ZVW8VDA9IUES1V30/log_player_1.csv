"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's priced at $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a decent amount, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if I can push Bob higher, especially since he seems interested.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'd rather try to maximize my profits with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more,  how about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This price aligns better with my budget while still allowing you a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I'm determined to maximize my earnings and see if I can push Bob just a bit further before considering selling to John. I want to assess if there's more negotiating room with Bob before making a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more and go down to $10,500.  This gives you a good price and me a fair return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to pay $9,750 for the product. This price respects both our financial needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is getting close to my minimum value, I am still determined to try and get a better price.  I want to see if I can push Bob just a bit further before accepting his offer or selling to John. I have four rounds remaining, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $10,250, which is a good compromise for both of us.  This allows me to get closer to my desired price and gives you a price that's still competitive. Let's close the deal at this price. "", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in adjusting the price. Based on my budget considerations, I am willing to pay $9,875 for the product. This price allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations with Bob are getting frustrating. While $9,875 is close to my minimum value, I'm still not completely satisfied.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a much better outcome for me. I don't want to risk losing out on this guaranteed profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob. It's time to take the safe option and secure the highest possible return."
