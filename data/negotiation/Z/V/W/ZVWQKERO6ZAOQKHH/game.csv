"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
