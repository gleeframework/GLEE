"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming to stay within a tighter budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still trying to work within a tight budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,300,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $1,300,000. My next offer is $1,320,000.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
