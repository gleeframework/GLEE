"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to split the difference - how about $13,000?  I'm really hoping we can reach a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $15,000. I'm willing to make one more concession - I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
