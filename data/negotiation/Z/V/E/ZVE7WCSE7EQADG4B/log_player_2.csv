"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price or buy it from John for $80 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) to see how much flexibility Alice has in her pricing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for me to increase my offer in subsequent rounds if needed, while still staying well below my $80 maximum. 
* **Balancing Act:** I'm trying to find a balance between a price that's good for me and one that Alice might actually accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above my $80 limit.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, moving from $120 to $90. There's a chance I can get her closer to my target price. 
* **John as Backup:** I can always fall back on buying from John for $80 if the negotiations with Alice don't work out favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $60 was too low, Alice. How about we try $70? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would really help me out."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm keeping it below my $80 limit.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting how this price would ""help me out,"" subtly reminding Alice that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm not jumping straight to $80 to keep some bargaining power and see if Alice might settle closer to $70."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $70 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $85. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** While tempting, $85 is still above my $80 budget.
* **Final Offer Likely:**  Alice's language suggests this might be her final offer.  She's used phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""finalize the sale."" 
* **John as a Viable Option:** I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Alice because I have the reliable option of buying from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be totally transparent, $80 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer.  I'm stating clearly that I can't go any higher.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm suggesting that a decision can be made right now at this price.
* **Transparency:** By being open about my budget limit, I'm hoping to gain Alice's trust and show that I'm serious about buying.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Alice Accepts:**  Ideal scenario! I get the product at my target price.
* **Alice Rejects:**  I'll likely buy from John for $80.  Alice might come back with a counteroffer, but it's unlikely to be below $80."
