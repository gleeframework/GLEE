"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see your point. However,  $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $1100000.  This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
