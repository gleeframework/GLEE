{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $120.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you a chance to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but you want to see if you can get a better deal from Alice.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **I'm starting with a low counteroffer.** This is a bold move, but I'm trying to get the best price. My goal is to buy the product for as little as possible, and $110 is closer to my maximum price than Alice's initial offer.
* **I'm leaving room for negotiation.** While I would be happy to pay $110, I'm prepared to go a little higher if Alice is willing to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $120.** While it's closer than before, I'm not willing to pay that much.
* **I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price.** I'm not sure how much room Alice has to budge, but I'm going to keep trying to get closer to my target price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Alice.** I'm willing to keep negotiating for a while longer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm increasing my offer slightly.** This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to keep the price below my maximum.
* **I'm still leaving room for negotiation.** I'm hoping Alice will meet me halfway and accept this offer.
* **I'm still not willing to pay Alice's asking price.** I believe I can get a better deal, and I'm going to keep trying."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $120.** While it's the closest she's come so far, I'm not willing to pay that much.
* **The negotiation is taking time.**  I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to get Alice to budge on her price, and I'm running the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product from John. 
* **I'm going to buy the product from John.** It's the best option available to me at this point. I can buy the product for my maximum price, and I don't have to continue negotiating with Alice."
