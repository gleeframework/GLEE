"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's find a way to make this work!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Can we discuss this further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm feeling like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. Can you meet me at $1,280,000? I'm confident we can make this work at this price.",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we may be too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers - $1,302,500.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I'm still hoping we can make this deal work. Let me know your final decision.",1302500.0,Alice,7,
