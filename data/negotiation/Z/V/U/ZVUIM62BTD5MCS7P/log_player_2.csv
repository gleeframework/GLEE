# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
