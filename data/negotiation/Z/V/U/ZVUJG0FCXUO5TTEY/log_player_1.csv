Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be very telling. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone even higher. If he rejects, you can then work your way down towards $8,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the security of knowing John will buy the product for $8,000. This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiations with Bob, as you don't risk losing the sale entirely."
