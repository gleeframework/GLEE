"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's truly worth $1500000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm interested in making a smart financial decision. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I would rather not spend more than that. Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay, so I'll accept it.
