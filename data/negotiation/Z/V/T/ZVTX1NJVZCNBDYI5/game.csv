"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective on the product's value, my initial offer reflects its true potential and the significant benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.

I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the true value of the product for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
