Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** There's room for negotiation, and Bob has incentive to accept.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not giving away the product for cheap, but you're also open to negotiating.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while also keeping Bob engaged. By starting with a reasonable offer, you increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still a significant drop from your initial offer and potentially leaves room for more profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a higher price, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? It's still a good value for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```
This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but also that you value your product. By splitting the difference, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is only $200 less than your last counteroffer.  It's a reasonable compromise, and it's still above the $10,000 you'd get from John.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
