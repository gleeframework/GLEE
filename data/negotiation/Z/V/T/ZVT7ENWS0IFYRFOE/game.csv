"I appreciate your confidence in your product, but I'm a bit limited on my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, so I'll offer $95. Can we meet at this price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to meet you halfway, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to go down to $98 for this product. It's a great deal for you, and it's close to my bottom line. What do you say?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is my final offer. Can we do business at this price?",92.0,Bob,6,
