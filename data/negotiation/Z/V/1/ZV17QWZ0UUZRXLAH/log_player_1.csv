Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of securing the best possible deal."
