"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. However, $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13500 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500. Can you meet me at that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $12500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13250, which is as low as I can go. It's a great price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $13250, which would be $12875. Can you consider that?",12875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $12875 is a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12875 and $13250, which would be $13062.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",13062.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $12500. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",12500.0,Bob,10,
