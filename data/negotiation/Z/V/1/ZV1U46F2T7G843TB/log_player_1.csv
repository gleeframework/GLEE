{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his proposed price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, and hopefully, we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,200.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to agree.  It's also important to note that with only 5 rounds left, the pressure is increasing to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've gone through several rounds, and while Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer, he's still significantly below my desired price.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to guarantee a good profit."
