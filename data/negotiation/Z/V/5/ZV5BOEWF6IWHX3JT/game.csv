"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer, but still a bit lower than what I need.  Let's meet at $14,250.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
