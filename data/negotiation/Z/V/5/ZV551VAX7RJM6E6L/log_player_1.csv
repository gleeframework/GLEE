Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Given its potential value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1,750,000.  Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more significant discount. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  There are 8 rounds remaining, so I have time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. The product holds significant value, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's compromise. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000. This is a fair offer, given the product's potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hesitant to accept. I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay $1,500,000, and there are still 6 rounds left.  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price with Bob or, if necessary, fall back on John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I still need to recoup my investment. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. With only four rounds remaining, the chances of negotiating a higher price with Bob are slim.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
