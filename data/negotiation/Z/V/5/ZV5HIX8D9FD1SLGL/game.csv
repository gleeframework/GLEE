"I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for 110. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that 105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a deal for 108. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",108.0,Alice,5,
