"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
