# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $1,500,000 is way over his budget. It makes more sense to try to negotiate with Alice first before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a respectable offer, it falls short of the product's true value and potential returns it can generate. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. I propose a price of $1,200,000.

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get closer to his target before considering John's offer."
