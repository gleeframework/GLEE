Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a little below where I need to be, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Bob should accept the offer. $10,500 is within his budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $8,000. It's also a fair price for both parties, allowing Alice to make a profit and Bob to get a good deal."
