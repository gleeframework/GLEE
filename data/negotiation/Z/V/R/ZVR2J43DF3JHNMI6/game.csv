,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  It's a fair price, considering I'm already paying more than what I would pay John. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a little below where I need to be, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,5,
