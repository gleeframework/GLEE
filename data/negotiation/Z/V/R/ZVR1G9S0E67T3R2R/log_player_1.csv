Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $925,000, which reflects its significant value."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming high initially makes sense. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **High but Reasonable:**  While high, the price is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll consider it. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Factors like your risk tolerance and how much you want to ensure the sale (vs. risking a lower price from John) could influence your approach."
