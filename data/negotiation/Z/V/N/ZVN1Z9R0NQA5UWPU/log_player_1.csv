Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than what it's worth to Bob, but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation.
* **The Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering what I'm willing to spend.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While I can sell to John for $15,000, there's a chance I can get closer to that price by continuing negotiations with Bob. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially drive the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000).
* **Maintaining Value:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message polite and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if we can't find common ground. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Bob is making it clear that he's not willing to budge much further, and continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate.
* **Secure Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is more than what I'd get if I continue to negotiate with Bob.

It's important to remember that while I might be able to get closer to my ideal price, there's no guarantee, and I could end up losing time and potentially even losing the deal entirely.  Given the risk and the fact that I have a secure alternative with John, selling to him is the best decision."
