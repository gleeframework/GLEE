"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering what I'm willing to spend.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if we can't find common ground. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
