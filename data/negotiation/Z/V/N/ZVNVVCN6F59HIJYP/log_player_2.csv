# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to exceed your expectations. This product holds immense value to me, but I understand its true worth lies in its utility and impact on your endeavors. Given its significance, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This is a chance to secure a remarkable asset at a price that is both fair and beneficial to both parties. I look forward to discussing this further and potentially bringing this product into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your acceptable price, or you can proceed with buying from John."
