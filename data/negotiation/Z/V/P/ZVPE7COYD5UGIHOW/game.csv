"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
