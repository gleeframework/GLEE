"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to secure a higher price from Bob in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a better price from Bob, Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly below my minimum. I'm not comfortable going lower and risking further rounds of negotiation. John's offer of $8,000 is the best available option at this point, securing me a reasonable profit."
