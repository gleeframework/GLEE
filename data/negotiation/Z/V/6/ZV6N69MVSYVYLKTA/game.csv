"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you at $720,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",720000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $720,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to pay $710,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the potential value it brings to me.  Let's make this deal happen!",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $710,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you at $725,000.
