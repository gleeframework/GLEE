Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high offer will also help you gauge Bob's level of interest and potential to meet your price. 

**Important Note:** While you have a fallback option with John, it's essential to be mindful of not appearing too inflexible with Bob. There's a chance he could walk away, and securing a deal, even slightly below your ideal price, is better than no deal at all."
