"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe you'll find it's a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far above my budget of $10,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I need to make a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it, but I'm only willing to go up to $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it for $8000 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $14,000 is still above my budget. I will reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for it, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $12500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $12,500 is still too high. I'm going to try to push her lower with another counteroffer.  I'm only $2,500 away from my max budget and still have more negotiation rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer you $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it and the fact that I'm close to my maximum. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 is your best offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $12750. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my maximum budget, but $12,750 is still above what I'm willing to pay.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't think I'll be able to get her down to my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000 to guarantee a purchase within my budget."
