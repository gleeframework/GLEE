Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, you leave room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will give you an idea of his perceived value and how willing he is to negotiate. 
* **Keep the door open to John:** If Bob doesn't accept your initial offer, you still have the option to sell to John for your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9500 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get a higher price.  By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to negotiate a higher price and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose $9600 as the price for the product. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer. It's close enough to my minimum value that it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
