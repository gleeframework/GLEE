"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision, and we can move forward from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $10,500, which is over your maximum budget of $10,000. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
