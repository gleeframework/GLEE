"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision, and we can move forward from there.",10500.0,Alice,1,
