Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. It's a great deal you won't want to miss!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""special price"" and ""won't want to miss"" are subtle ways to encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you're secure knowing you have John as a backup buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
