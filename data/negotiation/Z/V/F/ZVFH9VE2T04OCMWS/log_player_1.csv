Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $105 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to give Bob one more chance to meet my expectations.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm trying to do the same. I'm willing to come down to $112.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to go up to $108. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $108 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not quite there. We're getting close to the end of our rounds, but I'm still going to try to get a better offer from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  I really want to make this work, but I can't go any lower than $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm still not willing to pay $110. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's my final offer. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting very close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and Bob's final offer of $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While it would be nice to make a deal with Bob, I don't want to risk going too low and ending up with a price that's not worth it to me.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $120."
