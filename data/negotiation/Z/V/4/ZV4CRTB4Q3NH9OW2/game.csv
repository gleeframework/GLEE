"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm hoping to secure it for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a more profitable investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your desire to make a profitable investment.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a solid price that's fair to both of us. What do you think?",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
