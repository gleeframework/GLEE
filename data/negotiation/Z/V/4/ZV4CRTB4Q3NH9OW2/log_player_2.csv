"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth every penny to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can always purchase from John, although it's not the ideal scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm hoping to secure it for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a more profitable investment. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your desire to make a profitable investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's target:** While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal price of $1,050,000.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  Bob has room to bargain and try to get closer to his target. 
* **John's offer is still a fallback:** If negotiations fail, Bob can always purchase from John, but that's not the ideal outcome."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a solid price that's fair to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's target:**  $1,065,000 is only $15,000 above Bob's ideal price of $1,050,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk that Alice may not come down further or even increase her price.
* **John's offer is still an option:**  While not ideal, Bob can still buy from John if negotiations with Alice completely fail.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is close to his target and within his budget, minimizing the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
