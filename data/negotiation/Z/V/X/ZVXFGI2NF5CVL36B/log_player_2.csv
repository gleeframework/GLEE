# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering its worth $800,000 to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $825,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.

Alice's offer:

Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle on $795,000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I think you'll find it's a great value.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price. It makes more sense to cut our losses and buy from John for $800,000."
