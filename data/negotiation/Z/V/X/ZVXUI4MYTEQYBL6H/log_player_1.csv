{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing profit:** While this price is lower than my minimum value, it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Setting a benchmark:** By making the first offer, I establish a baseline for future negotiations.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** I can always adjust the price if necessary, or switch to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle yet. There's still room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he's willing to increase his offer.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll still be flexible but will aim for a price above $9,000. If Bob continues to refuse, I might reconsider selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? This would give us both a good deal. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns but reiterate my desire to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Negotiation tactic:**  I'm aiming to  meet Bob halfway, which often signals a willingness to compromise and can encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  I'm trying to find a price that is acceptable to both of us.
* **Maintaining my bargaining power:**  By not accepting Bob's first offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if needed.
* **Setting a new benchmark:** I'm establishing a new price point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal to John to achieve that. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly above $9,500, like $10,000.  If he continues to refuse, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as his offer is significantly higher and more profitable for me."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but $10,000 is my absolute bottom line. This price still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing $10,000, a slight increase from Bob's last offer. This demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation but still holding my ground.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the good deal it represents. 
* **Setting a final price:**  I'm stating that $10,000 is my absolute bottom line. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a final decision.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  I'm attempting to find a compromise that both of us can live with.
* **Making a final push:**  I'm making one last effort to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. While I've tried to negotiate with him, it's clear that we're too far apart in our desired prices. 

Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially risk losing both Bob and John, I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  His offer guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirement."
