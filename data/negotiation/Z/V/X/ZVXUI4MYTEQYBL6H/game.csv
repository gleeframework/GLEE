"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $9000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10500? This would give us both a good deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but $10000 is my absolute bottom line. This price still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",8500.0,Bob,6,
