"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking value. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above my minimum.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $10,000. How about $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
