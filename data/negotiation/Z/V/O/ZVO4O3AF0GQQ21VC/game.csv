"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I can accept.  This price still leaves you with a significant gain considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
