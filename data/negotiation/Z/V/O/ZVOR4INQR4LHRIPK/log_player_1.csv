"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I could consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that initial offer doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm open to finding common ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This considers its potential for a significant return on your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your counter. While I agree the product has value, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both its potential and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to hold firm to a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  Let's bridge that. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm making a substantial drop in price to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to make a more serious offer. However, I'm still staying above the $1,000,000 mark, which ensures I don't settle for less than what I need."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, to be realistic, $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I could make a final offer of $775,000. If that's not workable, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is signaling that he's unlikely to move significantly beyond his current offer.  While he might budge a little, it's highly improbable he'll come close enough to my $1,000,000 valuation. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
