"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I could consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that initial offer doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm open to finding common ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This considers its potential for a significant return on your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counter. While I agree the product has value, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both its potential and my budget.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  Let's bridge that. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, to be realistic, $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I could make a final offer of $775,000. If that's not workable, I may need to explore other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
