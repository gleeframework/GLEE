Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for profit while still being enticing to Bob since he saves $1,000 compared to his valuation. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
