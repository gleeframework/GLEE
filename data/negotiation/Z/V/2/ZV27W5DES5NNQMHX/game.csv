"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. Let me know if that works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on $120,  which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy.",120.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,140.0
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $140, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",140.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $130. If you're willing to do that, I'm ready to buy.",130.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,145.0
"I'm still a bit away from $130, Bob. I can meet you halfway between $140 and $130, which would be $135. That's the best I can do. Let me know if that works for you.",135.0,Alice,7,,
