I look forward to discussing the details further and potentially bringing this product to your organization.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit. She knows you have a maximum budget of $1,500,000 and is starting high.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a $200,000 difference between Alice's valuation ($1,200,000) and her current offer ($1,400,000). This suggests there's room for her to lower the price. 
* **John as Leverage:** You have John as a backup option, ensuring you won't be left without the product.

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. She'll likely come back with a lower price, closer to your desired range."
