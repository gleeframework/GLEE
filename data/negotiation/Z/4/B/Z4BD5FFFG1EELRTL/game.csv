"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm trying to be fair to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to meet you in the middle. How about $11,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,625? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",11625.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's finalize this deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my limit, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt. How about $11,250 again? I know you rejected it earlier, but I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $11,400 for the product. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. I'm not willing to go lower than this, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. ",11400.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm really at my limit. I'm willing to go up to $11,250 one more time. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15,000.",11250.0,Bob,10,
