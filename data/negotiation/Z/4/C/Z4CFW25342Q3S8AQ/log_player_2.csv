"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is a compromise, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He can still buy the product from John for $12,000, so there's no immediate need to accept a price above his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm expecting from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's getting close, but Bob is better off buying from John.  John is offering a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
