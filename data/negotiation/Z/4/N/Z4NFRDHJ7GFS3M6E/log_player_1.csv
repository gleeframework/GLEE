Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($120), hoping to maximize my earnings. I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $120, so this offer might be appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counter-offering with $115.  This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. It also signals that I'm willing to negotiate but won't go too far below my target."
