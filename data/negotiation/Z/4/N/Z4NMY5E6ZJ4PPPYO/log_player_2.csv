"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save more money by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000 shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good price. This initial offer is still well below your maximum budget, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000 and is still within your budget.  Further negotiation might get a lower price, but it's risky. There's a chance Alice might reject any further counteroffers and you'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and minimizes risk."
