"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for cheaper than $9,000. Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. This shows Alice you are serious about buying the product while also leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price range.  While it's closer to your initial counteroffer, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. You should reject the offer and try to counter again, aiming for a price closer to your initial $8,500 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also trying to get a better price than her initial offer.  By increasing your counteroffer slightly to $8,750, you show a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price lower than her current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without jeopardizing your goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much from her initial offer. Even though her price has come down slightly, it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying.  It's now becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to negotiate further. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John, who is offering a predictable price, even if it's higher than your ideal."
