{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but we can likely get it lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  This sets a strong starting point for negotiation and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. We'll see how she responds!"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is a good price, it's still a bit high.  We can try to squeeze out a bit more by continuing to negotiate.  There's still time and we can always fall back on John's offer if needed."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer again, and we're getting close to a price that's reasonable for both of us.  While we could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that we'll run out of time or Alice will get frustrated and walk away.  $760,000 is a good compromise, saving us $240,000 compared to buying from John."
