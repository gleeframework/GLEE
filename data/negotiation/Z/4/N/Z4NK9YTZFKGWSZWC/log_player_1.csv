"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and set the stage for a negotiation. It also leaves room for me to make concessions if needed while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit above $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still maintaining a significant profit. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also showing Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is getting close to the $1,000,000 mark, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more profit.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge just a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
``` 

I'm making a small concession to show I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm still aiming for a profit that's closer to my desired $1,000,000 mark.  This keeps the pressure on Bob to come up with a final counteroffer that gets us to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a difficult decision, but with only two rounds left, I believe it's time to move on.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below the $1,000,000 I can get from John.  I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John will guarantee me the highest possible return."
