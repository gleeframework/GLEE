"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $8,200 as my final offer. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.  What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,5,
