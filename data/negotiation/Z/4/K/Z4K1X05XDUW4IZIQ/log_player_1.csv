Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $11,500 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still attractive compared to my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as time-sensitive and exclusive, I aim to encourage Bob to make a quick decision and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point for negotiation. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation skills, I might be willing to slightly lower the price. However, I would never go below $12,000 as I have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
