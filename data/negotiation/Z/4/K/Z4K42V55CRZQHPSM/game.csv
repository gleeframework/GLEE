"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1100000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1100000. How about we meet in the middle at $1175000? This would allow us both to achieve a good outcome.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1175000. I can meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1212500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
