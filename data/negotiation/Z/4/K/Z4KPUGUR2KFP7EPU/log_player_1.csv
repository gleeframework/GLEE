{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you and I'm sure you can see its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

This offer starts at a price that is slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but significantly lower than what the product is worth to Alice. This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000 and you're valuing it at $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still not quite what I want. I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a slightly higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,200,000 as a final offer. I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer is still too low for me. It's very tempting to continue negotiating, but I've already gone down significantly from my initial price.  I'm confident that I can get my desired price from John, so it's time to move on and sell to him."
