"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Opening with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value provides room for negotiation. It establishes a strong initial position.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and potential for a higher sale price. His reaction will guide your next move. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind you have the John offer ($1,500,000) as a fallback if negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. It's highly likely a better deal can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but I believe your offer undervalues the product's potential significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't accept anything below $1,875,000.  This is a fairer offer considering its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by reducing your initial price by $375,000, but it remains significantly above both your minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Emphasize the product's ""true worth"" to reinforce that your price isn't arbitrary and encourage Bob to move closer to your range. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving but still positions you for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches both your minimum acceptable price and his perceived value of the product. This is a strong signal that it's unlikely he'll go any higher. Accepting now secures you a profitable outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome or stalemate."
