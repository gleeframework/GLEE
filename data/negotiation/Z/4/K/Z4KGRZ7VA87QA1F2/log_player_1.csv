Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit.
* **Lower than your minimum value:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob while still protecting your interests. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter his offer or even sell to John for $12,000, depending on his counteroffer and my assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum.  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,250 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial $10,000 goal, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise and a fair price considering the product's value.  It's also likely that I won't get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John would only earn me an extra $3,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer to close the deal."
