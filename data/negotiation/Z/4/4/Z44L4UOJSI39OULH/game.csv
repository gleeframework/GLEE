"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose an offer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the full value this product will deliver for you. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $950,000 might be a bit high for my current budget. I would like to propose an offer of $900,000. I hope this is within your considerations.",900000.0,Bob,4,
