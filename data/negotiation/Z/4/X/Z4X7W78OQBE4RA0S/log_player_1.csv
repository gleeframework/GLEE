{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is lower than my minimum but still leaves room for me to make a profit. It also frames the offer in a way that highlights the value of the product to Bob.  

I'm choosing to start by making an offer to Bob, rather than waiting for him to make a counteroffer. This is because I want to be in control of the negotiation and set the initial terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is significantly less than my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original price.  How about $11,000? It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is still a good price for Bob, and it allows me to make a profit. I'm also trying to build rapport by acknowledging his desire for a good deal and expressing my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $12,000 to $11,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant loss.  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and selling to John for $15,000 will achieve that.  Therefore, I will sell to John."
