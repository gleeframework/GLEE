"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is a good one, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a valuable asset.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $950,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",950000.0,Bob,4,
