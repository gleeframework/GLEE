Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a valuable asset.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise for me.
