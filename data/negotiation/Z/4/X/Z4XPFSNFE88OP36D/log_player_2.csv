"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This represents a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's well below its true worth. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
