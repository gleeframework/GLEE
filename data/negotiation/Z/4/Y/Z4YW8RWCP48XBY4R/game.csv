,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $82.50? I'm willing to negotiate a bit further, but I can't go any lower than that.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
