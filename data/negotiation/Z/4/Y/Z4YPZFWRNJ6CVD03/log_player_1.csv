{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay this price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $100.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $120. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping Bob will find this price acceptable, but I'm still willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum value of $100 and higher than what I could get from John. I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
