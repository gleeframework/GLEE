"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a special price! Would you like to buy it from me for $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $125 is a decent price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her initial offer might prompt her to sweeten the deal. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
