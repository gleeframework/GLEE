"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $12,800. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,800 is very close to my limit, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?  If so, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",12000.0,Bob,6,
