"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to let it go for $9500. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I have to make a living from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9000 for the product. How about we compromise at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there.  $8500 feels like a fair price that would benefit both of us.  Let's close this deal at that price, and we can both move on.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $9200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $9200 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This feels like a win-win for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I've already met you at $9200 and then came down to $9000, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $9250 for the product. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,7,
