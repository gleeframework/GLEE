"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
