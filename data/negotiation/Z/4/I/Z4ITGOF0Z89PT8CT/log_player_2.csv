Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's final offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. It makes more financial sense to stick to your budget and buy from John, even if it means missing out on a slightly lower price from Alice."
