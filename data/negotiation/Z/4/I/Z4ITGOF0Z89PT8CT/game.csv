"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while working for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
