(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still far too high.  It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum. This will hopefully push Alice towards a more reasonable price point.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's moving in the right direction. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and hopefully close the gap further.  I'm still wary of going over my $800,000 limit, so I'll keep John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm still aware of my budget constraint and will keep John's offer as a fallback if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for too much. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a price closer to my budget. I'm not yet ready to buy from John, as I believe I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but this time by a smaller margin. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also sticking to my budget. If she rejects this offer, I'm seriously considering buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm running out of time.  I've made significant efforts to negotiate, but it seems Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
