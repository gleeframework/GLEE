Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that you've expressed interest in. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $115 is still higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This price is still above your minimum, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It shows flexibility:** It shows you're willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

This approach sets the stage for a productive negotiation while ensuring you're in a good position to either sell to Bob or move on to John if the deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You should reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. You have a backup option with John, so you're not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $110?  That's a fair price that's still within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a good middle ground: 
* **It shows flexibility:** You've reduced your price, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **It's still profitable:** $110 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're leaving space for further discussion, but you're still holding firm to a price that is reasonable for you."
