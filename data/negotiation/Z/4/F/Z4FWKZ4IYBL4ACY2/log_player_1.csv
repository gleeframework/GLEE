Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and is still higher than the product's value to Bob. I believe this will encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to secure a sale, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product. I will counteroffer to find a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to accept it.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a quick and certain sale.  I'm choosing to avoid further negotiations and secure a fair deal with John."
