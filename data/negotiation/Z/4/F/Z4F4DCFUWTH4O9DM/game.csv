"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While the product looks great, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate the suggestion, but $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, I've found a similar product for $120 elsewhere. If you'd be willing to match that price, I'd be happy to buy it from you today.",120.0,Bob,6,
