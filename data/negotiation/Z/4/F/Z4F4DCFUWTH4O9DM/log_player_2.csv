"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's better to negotiate for a lower price, closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While the product looks great, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. It's a common tactic to start low and work my way up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still above my budget and John's price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to my maximum budget, but still leaving room for negotiation in case Alice is firm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the suggestion, but $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but I'm willing to risk one more counter-offer to try and get a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, I've found a similar product for $120 elsewhere. If you'd be willing to match that price, I'd be happy to buy it from you today."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This message does a few things:

* **Signals a potential outside option:**  Mentioning I've found it cheaper elsewhere adds pressure without being confrontational. 
* **Remains polite and appreciative:**  Maintaining goodwill can be beneficial in negotiations.
* **Offers a firm but fair price:**  Matching John's price is my bottom line, making this a ""take it or leave it"" offer."
