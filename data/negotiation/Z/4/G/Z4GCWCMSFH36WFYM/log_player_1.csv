Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $825,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is still a little steep for me - how about $760,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price. While $760,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $760,000 is pushing it. How about we settle at $800,000 even? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, it's strategic to hold firm at $800,000. This price matches my fallback option with John.  By framing it as a final offer that meets both our needs, I put a bit of pressure on Bob while still leaving room for negotiation if he counters."
