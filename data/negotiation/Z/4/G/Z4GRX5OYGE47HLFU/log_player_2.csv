# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can likely get a better price than $1,750,000, and you're still willing to pay more than Alice's minimum."

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, it's still above your target. You can likely negotiate a price closer to $1,600,000.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy."
