"Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is immense, and I am confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I am offering it at the price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value. How about we start with $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However,  $650,000  significantly undervalues the true potential and unique advantages of this product. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  To be frank, I've seen similar products on the market for less.  Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but comparing this product to others on the market wouldn't be doing it justice.  It offers unique advantages and a level of quality that others simply don't. I'm willing to move down slightly to $975,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value you'll be receiving.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price gap is still quite wide. I need to see a more significant move to make this work. How about $800,000? That's my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
