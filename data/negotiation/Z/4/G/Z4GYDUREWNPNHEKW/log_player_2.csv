# Alice's message: Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is immense, and I am confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I am offering it at the price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both my budget and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value. How about we start with $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However,  $650,000  significantly undervalues the true potential and unique advantages of this product. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down in price, but it's still far too high. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  To be frank, I've seen similar products on the market for less.  Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but comparing this product to others on the market wouldn't be doing it justice.  It offers unique advantages and a level of quality that others simply don't. I'm willing to move down slightly to $975,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value you'll be receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  We're still significantly above my ideal price and what John is offering. It's time to push a bit harder and see if Alice is truly willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price gap is still quite wide. I need to see a more significant move to make this work. How about $800,000? That's my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
