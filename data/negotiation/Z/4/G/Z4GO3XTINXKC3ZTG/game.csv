"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. Let's start with an offer of $140. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This allows us both to be satisfied with the transaction.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $115.  Would that price point be feasible?",115.0,Bob,4,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, how does $120 sound to you? It's a bit higher than your last suggestion, but still below the original asking price.",120.0,Alice,5,
