I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to me and $10,000 to him. It gives Bob a chance to get a good deal, while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000.  This is still a good deal for him, considering his value is $10,000, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, his counteroffers are still too low. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a deal below my minimum acceptable price."
