"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go that low.  $750,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I still think $825,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000. How about $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $787,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $806,250? This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",806250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I still think $806,250 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no more. This is my final offer.",795000.0,Bob,6,
