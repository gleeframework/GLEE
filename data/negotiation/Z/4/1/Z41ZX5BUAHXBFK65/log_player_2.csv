"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible."
