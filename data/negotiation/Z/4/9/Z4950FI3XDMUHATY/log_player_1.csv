Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
This is a significant lowball from Bob. We need to steer him significantly closer to our acceptable range. Selling to John is a last resort if we can't bridge the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly surpasses that figure. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's inherent worth and potential for substantial return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 2000000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value is high, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can increase my offer to $1,350,000. Hopefully, we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, we're still not there yet. We can afford to negotiate a bit more before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my sincerity in closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive offer for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,500,000 is the highest I can go.  I'm ready to close the deal right now at that price if you're willing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price.  There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations or going with John at this point."
