Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than mine. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob's thoughts and counteroffers, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me at least $1,200,000. This knowledge empowers me to be firmer in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to reach at least the midpoint between our initial prices ($1,350,000). Rejecting his offer signals that I'm looking for a more favorable agreement. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation since I have a solid backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,300,000 doesn't fully reflect that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our previous offers, demonstrating fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's high value, justifying my counteroffer. 
* **Confident Tone:** I'm using a confident but not aggressive tone to encourage agreement without appearing overly demanding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll try to accommodate you as best as possible within my budget. My counteroffer would be $1,325,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the absolute midpoint, it's a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price and further negotiation might risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer secures a strong return and avoids the uncertainty of continued back-and-forth."
