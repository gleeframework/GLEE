"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still above your budget. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,325,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  Rejecting this offer gives you another chance to negotiate and hopefully get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still trying to stay as close to my budget as possible. I'm offering $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the conversation. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the value I bring to the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's clear that we're not going to reach a price that's significantly below your budget.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price, saving you valuable time and effort in further negotiations."
