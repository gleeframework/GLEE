"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still trying to stay as close to my budget as possible. I'm offering $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the conversation. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the value I bring to the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of our needs. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
