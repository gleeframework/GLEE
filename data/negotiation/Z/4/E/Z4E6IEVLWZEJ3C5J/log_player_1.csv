Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it holds significant value for you."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for potential haggling, while still securing a significant profit over my minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net, allowing me to aim higher with Bob."
