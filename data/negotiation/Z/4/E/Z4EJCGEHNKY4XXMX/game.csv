"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
