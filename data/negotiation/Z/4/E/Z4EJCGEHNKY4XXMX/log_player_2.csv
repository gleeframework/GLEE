"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its worth.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $130 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$115 is still a bit too high, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate. Let's try to get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
