"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a significant offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is the minimum I can accept, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
