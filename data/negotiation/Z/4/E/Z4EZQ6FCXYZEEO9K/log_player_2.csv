"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. Would you consider $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still too high for Bob's budget.  While he could continue to negotiate, with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal increases. Buying from John at $80 ensures a successful purchase within his budget."
