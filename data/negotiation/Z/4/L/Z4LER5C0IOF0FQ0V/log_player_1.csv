Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting too low.  He's now significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  His mention of John also suggests he might be trying to use that as leverage. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
