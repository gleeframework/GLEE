"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm confident in its potential to exceed your expectations. I can come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects its true worth and ensures a win-win scenario for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,012,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $925,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider buying from John.",925000.0,Bob,6,
