"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
