"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
