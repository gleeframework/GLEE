Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I believe it's a fair price considering the product is worth at least $12,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer at $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer than before, I'm not confident he'll budge much further. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with him. I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
