"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Let's find common ground and make this deal work.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial. I could come down to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth while still allowing some room for negotiation.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,100,000 is still above my limit.  I'm ready to pay $1,900,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and get this deal done.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
