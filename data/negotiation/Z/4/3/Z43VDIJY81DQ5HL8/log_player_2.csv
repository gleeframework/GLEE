"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your inventory. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can always buy from John for $120."
