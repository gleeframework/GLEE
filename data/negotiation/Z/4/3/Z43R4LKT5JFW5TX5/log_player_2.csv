"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider selling it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, $105 is still above my target. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to my target price while still leaving some room for further negotiation.  Alice might be more receptive to a smaller price jump this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite comfortable with $97, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering $102. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better price. $102 is still a bit too high for my liking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  Let's make this easy - $99 and we have a deal.  It's a great price for a product you'll love."",
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

This counter-offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **Strong Position:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and we're now in a price range where it makes sense to be firm. 
* **Odd Pricing Psychology:**  $99 feels significantly cheaper than $100 to many people, making it more appealing. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, encouraging a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm counteroffering $100.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting ridiculous.  While $100.50 is very close to Alice's value, it's clear she's trying to squeeze out every last cent. I'm willing to walk away if I can't get a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I've enjoyed negotiating with you, but I'm afraid we've reached an impasse. I'm willing to pay $100 even, as that's a fair price for both of us.  If you can't agree, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, reflecting a price I believe is reasonable while still staying under my budget.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, I need to make Alice understand I'm serious about walking away.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice that I have John as a backup."
