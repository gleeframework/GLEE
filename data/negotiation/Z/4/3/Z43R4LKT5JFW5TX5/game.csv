"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider selling it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $105.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite comfortable with $97, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering $102.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  Let's make this easy - $99 and we have a deal.  It's a great price for a product you'll love.",99.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm counteroffering $100.50.",100.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've enjoyed negotiating with you, but I'm afraid we've reached an impasse. I'm willing to pay $100 even, as that's a fair price for both of us.  If you can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,8,
