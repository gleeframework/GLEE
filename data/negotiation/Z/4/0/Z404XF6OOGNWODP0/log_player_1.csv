Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've already spoken to another seller who is willing to sell it to me for that price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than what you're proposing.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I've already spoken to another seller who is willing to sell the product to me for $1,200,000, and I'm not sure I can justify paying more. Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000, or perhaps throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $1,200,000 offer.  There's no indication he'll go any higher. Since I have a guaranteed offer for the same amount from John, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
