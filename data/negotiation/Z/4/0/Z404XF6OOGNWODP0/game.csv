"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've already spoken to another seller who is willing to sell it to me for that price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than what you're proposing.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I've already spoken to another seller who is willing to sell the product to me for $1,200,000, and I'm not sure I can justify paying more. Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000, or perhaps throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
