"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but still below my minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I want to signal that I'm willing to compromise, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I'm willing to negotiate further:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **I have time:** With 10 rounds, I have room to explore options and potentially reach a better agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $120?  I'm flexible and open to a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $130 to $120, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Openness:** I'm emphasizing my flexibility and willingness to find a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price with more rounds of negotiation.
* **John is a backup:** I know I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will increase his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  $110 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to go down to $115. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is close to my minimum, but I'm signaling that it's my last move. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""final offer"" statement adds pressure to get Bob to agree.
* **Motivation:**  I'm highlighting the progress made (we're within a $5 difference) to make the deal seem more achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $105? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay under $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are already on round 6, and I'm running out of time to reach a better deal. 
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $105 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a safe option:**  I can sell the product to John for $150, which is a much better deal than what Bob is offering. 

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that may result in an even lower price."
