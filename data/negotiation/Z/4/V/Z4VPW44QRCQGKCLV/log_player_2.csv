"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $7,500 is a good starting point, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob can use this time to try and get the price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 7000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price range, and at $7,250, the offer is now very close to what Bob is willing to pay.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will become unwilling to continue the negotiation.  Accepting at this point ensures Bob gets a good deal without jeopardizing the sale."
