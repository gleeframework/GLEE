"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has tremendous potential and I'm confident it will bring you substantial value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial solution. Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
