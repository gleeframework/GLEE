Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make a compelling offer just for you. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below her own $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but is still a significant profit for Alice.
* **Confidentiality:**  By mentioning a ""confidential"" minimum, Alice creates the impression that she's already offering a good deal, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice doesn't need to be desperate because she knows John will buy it at her minimum price. This confidence allows her to aim higher with Bob."
