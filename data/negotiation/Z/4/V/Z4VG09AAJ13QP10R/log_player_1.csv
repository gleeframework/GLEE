Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hopeful to get closer to my desired price point of $1,150,000. I have 9 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
