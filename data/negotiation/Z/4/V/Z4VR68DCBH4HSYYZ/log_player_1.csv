{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the potential benefit for both of us. This builds a good foundation for the negotiation.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential earnings:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer.
* **Provides flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can either negotiate further or move on to John. This keeps my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. 

**Why reject and counteroffer?**

* **Negotiation opportunity:** Even though Bob's initial offer is low, he's shown interest.  This means there's still potential for negotiation. 
* **Increase potential earnings:**  I can try to bring Bob closer to a price that's more favorable for me.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my ideal price. This will keep the negotiation going and potentially lead to a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is a compromise.  It's higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, framing the deal as mutually beneficial. This helps to maintain a positive negotiating tone.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer gauges Bob's willingness to negotiate.  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his initial offer and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale.  This keeps me in a stronger negotiating position.
* **Room for flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I still have options. I can either make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I consider a fair price for the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating.

**Why reject and counteroffer?**

* **Potential for better deal:** There's still room to increase the price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, suggesting he values the product.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. This positions me to potentially get a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still being reasonable for Bob."
