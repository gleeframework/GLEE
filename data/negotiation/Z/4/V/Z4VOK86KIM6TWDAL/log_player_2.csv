(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in the 9th round of negotiations.  While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it's still above Bob's ideal price. With only one round remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might not be willing to lower her price further. 

Considering that buying from John will cost Bob $1,200,000, buying the product from Alice for $1,160,000 is still a better deal, even if it's not ideal. The benefit of buying from Alice is that Bob saves $40,000 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and close the deal."
