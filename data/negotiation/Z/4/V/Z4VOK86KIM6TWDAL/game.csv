"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I can meet you in the middle at $1175000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1175000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I need to emphasize that this is a stretch for me. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to help you with that. However, $1150000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1125000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1140000, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement. I need to consider other options, including selling to John. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1140000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm eager to make this deal work. I'm willing to go up to $1130000. This is a significant improvement from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1130000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to meet you at $1160000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit anxious about selling to John if we can't agree on a price. Let's see if we can make one last push for a deal.",1160000.0,Alice,9,
