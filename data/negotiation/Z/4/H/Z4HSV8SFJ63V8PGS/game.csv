"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me for this opportunity. While I'm interested,  $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $11500?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13000, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13000, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  Let's split the difference. How about $12500? I'm really interested in this product, but this is the highest I can go.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12500. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. How about $14000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
