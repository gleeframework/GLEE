"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping this initial offer will pique his interest while still allowing me to secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away.  I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer one more time, but if he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

This is my final offer. I'm coming down to $12,500, which is still a good profit for me. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  He's clearly not willing to meet me in the middle, and his offers are getting too low.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000.  While I wanted to get more,  $12,000 is still my minimum acceptable value, and I don't want to risk getting even less."
