Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a profit well above my minimum. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so starting high allows me to gauge his interest and potentially get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price in the next round.  I'm also not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still a chance to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility. It's also a price that's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his $1,500,000 offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal. It's time to move on and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
