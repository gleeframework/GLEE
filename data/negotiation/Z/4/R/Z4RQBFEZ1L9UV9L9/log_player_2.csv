"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's minimum value of $100.  A $105 counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $108 is still within Bob's budget of $120 and is a decent compromise.
* **Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a higher price, or Alice could become frustrated and walk away.  

At this point, accepting the offer is a reasonable choice for Bob to secure the product at a good price."
