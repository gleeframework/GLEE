Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a price that's still beneficial to me. If he rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to inform my next move, and if negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. There's still potential for a mutually beneficial deal, and I want to explore that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum value.  While I'd love to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer. It's a good deal, and I'll accept."
