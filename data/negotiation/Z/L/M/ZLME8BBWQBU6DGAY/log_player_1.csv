Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for room to negotiate and potentially settle at a price both of us are happy with.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I have a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm unfortunately not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's room for further negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise that meets Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one.
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation amicable to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving some room for further negotiation, if necessary, to potentially reach an acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good deal for both of us as it's closer to your desired price while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Room for Improvement:**  While closer, there's still room for improvement and negotiation. I'm confident I can push for a higher price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** My guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000 provides a strong safety net, allowing me to take a risk with continued negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This is a fair compromise and a solid deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer represents a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, demonstrating a willingness to find common ground.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message is phrased positively and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Staying Firm:** While willing to compromise, I'm not drastically lowering my price, keeping the negotiation close to my desired range.
* **Leaving Room for a Final Agreement:**  This counteroffer provides a small margin for further negotiation, but it's still within a range that's acceptable for me."
