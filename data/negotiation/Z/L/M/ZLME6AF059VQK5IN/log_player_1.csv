"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $17,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($17,000 vs. $15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone sets a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value to me emphasizes its worth and justifies the initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $17000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $14,000 is below my minimum price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is below my threshold, it's close enough that there's potential for further negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is not optimal:**  Selling to John for $15,000 would be a safe option, but it would be better to try and get a higher price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? It's a fair compromise and reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  My counter-offer of $16,000 is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but haven't completely abandoned my desired price. 
* **Emphasize fairness:**  By using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""value of this product,"" I'm attempting to justify my offer and appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone helps to keep the negotiation amicable and open to finding a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can close it here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum price of $15,000. This is a good deal for me.
* **Close to my target:** While I initially wanted more, $15,500 is a good outcome, especially considering Bob's counteroffers.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate. It's better to take this offer and secure a profit. 
* **Time pressure:** We're already in round 4, and every round that passes increases the risk of me needing to sell to John at a lower price."
