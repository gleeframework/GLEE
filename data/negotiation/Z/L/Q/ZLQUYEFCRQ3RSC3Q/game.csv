"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $150 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $135 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at that price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
