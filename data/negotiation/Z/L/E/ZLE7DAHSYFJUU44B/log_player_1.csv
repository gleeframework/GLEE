"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're starting with a strong initial offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits to Bob's business helps justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open, signaling that we're willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than both our desired price and his perceived value. We have room to negotiate and can likely reach a better outcome in subsequent rounds. Selling to John would be a last resort if negotiations with Bob completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** We're briefly acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating that it's too low.
* **Significant Drop:**  We're making a significant drop from our initial offer ($950,000) to $875,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:** This new price acts as a strong anchor, moving the negotiation closer to our desired range while still leaving some room for compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer is increasing, but at a very slow pace. Accepting now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table.
* **Negotiating Power:** We still have time and rounds for negotiation. Showing a willingness to walk away (or sell to John) maintains our negotiating power. 
* **Target Price:** Our goal is to get as close to $875,000 as possible. Accepting $750,000 is a significant deviation from this target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is undeniable, and $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make a final offer of $825,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I need a decision from you this round."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging Bob's effort but standing firm on the price needing to be higher.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our final offer, we're creating a sense of urgency and signaling that we're serious about our bottom line.
* **Compromise:** We've come down to $825,000, splitting the difference between our previous offer ($875,000) and his last counteroffer ($750,000). This shows a willingness to compromise, but not at the cost of a significant loss. 
* **Decision Deadline:**  Requiring a decision this round puts the ball in Bob's court and prevents the negotiation from dragging on unnecessarily. We're prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
