```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing that I'm getting closer to accepting.  I'm confident that Alice will accept this offer, as it's within her acceptable range and we've both made concessions.  However, if she rejects, I'll still have a few rounds left to reach a final agreement."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,085,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to go any lower, and I'm only one round away from having to accept her final offer or walk away.  Given that I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous for me to take John's offer rather than risk paying $1,090,000 to Alice.  While I would have liked to save an additional $85,000,  securing the product at my target price is the most important factor."
