Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth to the right buyer. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant worth"" to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""I believe this represents a fair deal..."" and ""What are your thoughts?"" suggests a willingness to discuss the price further, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob without losing him to a rejection. If Bob counters, Alice can gauge his seriousness and potentially negotiate down slightly, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup offer."
