{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm selling it for $140. It's worth a lot more to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $110 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $125, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $117 is a reasonable compromise and closer to my desired price than selling to John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
