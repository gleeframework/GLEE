"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm offering $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is taking into account the true value and potential of this product. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
