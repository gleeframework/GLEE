"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm prepared to drop my price slightly, considering your offer. My counteroffer is $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
