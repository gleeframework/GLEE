This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows I'm willing to be flexible and negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's so far below my value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm still not able to meet at $11,500. I would like to propose $10,500 as it feels closer to the value I can reasonably offer. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I am comfortable moving forward with an offer of $10,800 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of your item while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $10,800 is still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum. I've already made several counteroffers, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for more. It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing at all."
