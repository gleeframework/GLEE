Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  While aiming high, the message also conveys that you value the product and believe it's worth the price to Bob. However, it doesn't come across as excessively greedy, leaving room for negotiation."
