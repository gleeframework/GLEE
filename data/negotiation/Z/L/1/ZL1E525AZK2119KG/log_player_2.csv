"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're comfortable with.  It's worthwhile to keep negotiating, especially since you have more rounds to go.  There's room to meet in the middle without going all the way to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement closer to $875,000.  This would be a fair price that allows for a good profit for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the gap."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to $875,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is still a good compromise. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer, but still higher than what you're aiming for. You've made some progress, and you're getting close to your target.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a slightly lower price. Remember, you have 5 rounds left, so you still have time to get a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $920,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and agree on $895,000.  This would be a good compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 895000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $895,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $910,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you'd ideally like to get the price lower, Alice's offer of $910,000 is getting closer to your goal. You only have 3 rounds left, and the risk of going to John is significant. Accepting this offer guarantees you the product at a reasonable price, and you avoid the potential of needing to pay John's higher price if negotiations with Alice fail."
