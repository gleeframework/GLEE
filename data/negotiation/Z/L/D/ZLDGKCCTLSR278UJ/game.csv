"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $950,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to go as high as $880,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more.
