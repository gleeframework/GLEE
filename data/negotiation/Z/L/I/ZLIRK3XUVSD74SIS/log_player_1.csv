Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:** Highlighting that this is a pre-public offer adds a sense of urgency and value for Bob."
