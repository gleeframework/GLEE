"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a significant discount.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While Alice is exaggerating the value to you, $12,000 is still a better price than John's offer of $15,000."
