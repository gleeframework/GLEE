"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we do $17500? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",17500.0,Alice,5,
