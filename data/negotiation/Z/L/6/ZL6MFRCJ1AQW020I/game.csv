"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,500 is my final offer. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Could we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $11,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
