Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,500 is my final offer. Let me know your thoughts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $11,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we've reached a price that's a good deal for both of us. It's better to secure the product at $11,750 than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John $15,000."
