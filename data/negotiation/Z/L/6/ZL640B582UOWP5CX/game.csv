"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would still give you a great deal and leave me with a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
