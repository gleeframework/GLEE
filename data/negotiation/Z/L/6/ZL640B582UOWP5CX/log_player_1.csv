Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's space to negotiate. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the value of your product.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is still above your minimum, it's lower than your initial offer. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would still give you a great deal and leave me with a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but are not giving in too easily. 
* **Is a compromise:**  It's a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's.
* **Is still a profitable deal:** $1,350,000 is more than your minimum acceptable price.

Let's see if Bob agrees to this compromise!"
