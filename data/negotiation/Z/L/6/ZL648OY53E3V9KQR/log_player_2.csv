"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it presents a great opportunity for you.  However, I've also received a firm offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer, so I can't hold this offer open for too long. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
