Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 gives you significant room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you know its worth is precisely $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of scarcity and desirability. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  You get a fantastic deal, exceeding your minimum by a large margin.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have space to haggle and potentially meet in the middle, still making a substantial profit.
* **Bob rejects:** You haven't lost anything and can proceed to sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
