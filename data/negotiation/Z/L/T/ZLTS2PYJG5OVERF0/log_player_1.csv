{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still being fair to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $10,000, your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's value, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows confidence:**  Offering a price close to your desired outcome shows you believe in the product's value. 

Remember, you can adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below your desired price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is still a bit lower than your ideal price, it's a good deal considering Bob's initial offer and the option of selling to John for $10,000. It's likely that further negotiations won't get you significantly more, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
