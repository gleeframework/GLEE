Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum Price:** $1,500,000 (anything less and you're better off selling to John).
* **Bob's Maximum Value:** $1,200,000 (he's unlikely to pay more).
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is only possible if one of you compromises.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you hold a strong position.  You can aim high with your initial offer, knowing you have John as a backup. However, starting too high might make Bob completely walk away without even trying to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:**  This starting point leaves room for negotiation while still positioning the product as high-value. 
* **No Justification:**  Avoid providing reasons for the price. This gives you flexibility later.
* **Focus on Value:**  Your message highlights the product's ""exceptional value and potential"" to pique Bob's interest.

**Possible Outcomes**

1. **Bob Accepts:** Unlikely, given the price is significantly above his perceived value.
2. **Bob Counter-Offers:** This is the ideal scenario.  Bob's counter-offer will reveal how much he's truly willing to pay.  You can then negotiate down towards your minimum, knowing you have John as a safety net.
3. **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your desired price.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is about finding a mutually agreeable price. While you have a strong position, being open to some negotiation (within reason) could still lead to a successful sale to Bob."
