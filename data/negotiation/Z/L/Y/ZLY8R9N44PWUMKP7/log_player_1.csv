Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth without being too aggressive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), suggesting you're willing to hear Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
