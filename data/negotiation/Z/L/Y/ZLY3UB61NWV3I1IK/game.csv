"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start things off, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While the product is truly valuable at $14,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $11,500?  That would make it much easier for me to commit.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I value your interest and I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. How about we settle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
