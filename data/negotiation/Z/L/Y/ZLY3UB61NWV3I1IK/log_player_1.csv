Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start things off, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While the product is truly valuable at $14,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $11,500?  That would make it much easier for me to commit.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I value your interest and I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. How about we settle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly very interested and $11,750 is a strong offer that surpasses my minimum by a good margin.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely."
