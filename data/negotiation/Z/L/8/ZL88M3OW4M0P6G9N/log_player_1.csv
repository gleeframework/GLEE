Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm willing to accept a lower price, but I want to see if Bob is serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I want to make sure I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired value. I'm happy to accept this price and secure the sale.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's always a risk that Bob might walk away, or I might not be able to get a significantly better offer. It's better to take this good deal and move on."
