"Alice,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,400,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
