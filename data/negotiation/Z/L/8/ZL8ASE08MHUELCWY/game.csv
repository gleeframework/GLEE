"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,250,000.  This price still leaves plenty of room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
