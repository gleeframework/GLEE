Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,250,000.  This price still leaves plenty of room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
