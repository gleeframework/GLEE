"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $7,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a price of $7,250. It's still a good deal for me, but I'm trying to find a middle ground.",7250.0,Alice,5,
