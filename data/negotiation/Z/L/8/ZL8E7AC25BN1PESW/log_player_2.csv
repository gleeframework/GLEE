"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob's budget. While it's a competitive price, Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate counteroffers and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm really interested in this product and would like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant investment for me. I hope you'll consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $925,000 is still higher than his ideal price. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. He can still potentially get a better price, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for further counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm committed to making this deal work, and I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my investment. I hope you'll accept this final offer."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $910,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $920,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, and with only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will be able to get a better price.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John, who is offering a lower price."
