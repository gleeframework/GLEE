"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm really interested in this product and would like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product.
