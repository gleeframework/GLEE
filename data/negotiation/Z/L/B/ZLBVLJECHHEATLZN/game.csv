"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I really like the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $9000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8200.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your eagerness to get the product, Bob, and I appreciate your serious offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8200. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. How about we meet at $8400? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",8400.0,Alice,5,
