Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($150) to leave some room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to earn a little more without risking losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for $80, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer, but $80 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $120 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with $120, which is still a good profit for me and leaves some room for further negotiation.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $100? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly what the product is worth to him.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair price and avoids further negotiation.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a sale and avoid any risk of Bob walking away completely."
