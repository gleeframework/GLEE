"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still a bit too high. It's time to counter-offer and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and appreciative:** Maintaining a positive tone helps negotiations go smoothly.
* **Express interest:** Showing we're serious about the product encourages Alice to work with us.
* **Set a firm target:**  $70 is a good starting point, leaving room for compromise while staying well below our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $85.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to our price range, but we can still try to get a better deal.  We'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a friendly and optimistic tone.
* **Shows Compromise:** We've moved up from $70, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 is a strong position, only $5 away from our ideal price while still offering Alice a decent profit."
