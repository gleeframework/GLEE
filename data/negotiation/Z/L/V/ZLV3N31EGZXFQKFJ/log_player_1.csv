Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  Offering $100  leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm taking a huge loss.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or if I should sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.  
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll use the information from Bob's counteroffer to determine the best counteroffer strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer above Bob's offer:** I'm countering with $95, which is higher than Bob's offer of $85 but still lower than my initial offer of $100. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Closer to my minimum:** $95 brings me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm framing the counteroffer positively, highlighting the value of the product and expressing a willingness to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll have a successful sale. If he rejects, I'll analyze his new counteroffer and decide whether to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $90 is only $30 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I would prefer a higher price, there's always the chance that Bob might be willing to go up a bit if I reject his offer.
* **Risk of losing John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer again, there's a chance that John might change his mind or find another product.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer for $90. This is a good deal for me considering I can still make a decent profit and avoid the risk of losing John as a buyer. I might even try to negotiate a slightly higher price later, but for now, I'm happy with this outcome."
