You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a lower price. You can always buy from John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you.

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you another opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
