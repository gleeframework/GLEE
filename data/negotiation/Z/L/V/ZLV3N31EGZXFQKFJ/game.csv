"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
