# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price of $15,000.** You want to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better deal.**  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still above your target price of $15,000.**  You are determined to stay within your budget.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer again could lead to a stalemate or further price increases.** It's not guaranteed that she'll budge further, and you risk wasting time.
* **Buying from John for $15,000 is the best option at this point.** While not ideal, it ensures you get the product and stays within your initial price limit."
