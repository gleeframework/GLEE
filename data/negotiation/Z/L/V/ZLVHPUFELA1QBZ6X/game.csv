"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has great potential, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this revised price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth and leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable point.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm prepared to spend. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming up on the price.  However, I need to be straightforward: $1,200,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for a product of this caliber.  Its long-term value and potential benefits far exceed the immediate price tag. To be transparent,  I've received significant interest from other potential buyers. However, I value our discussions and believe we can still reach an agreement. Would you be willing to consider a price point closer to $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
