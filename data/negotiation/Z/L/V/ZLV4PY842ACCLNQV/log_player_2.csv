I am offering this extraordinary opportunity to acquire it at a special price tailored just for you. Please consider my offer carefully and let me know if you wish to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $950,000. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with buying from John."
