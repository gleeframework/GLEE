"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $500,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get it lower. It's too early in the negotiation to accept, and there's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This sets the stage for a negotiation and signals Bob's willingness to walk away if the price isn't right.  A $400,000 offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within Bob's budget. This approach aims to push Alice towards a more agreeable price while leaving room for counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $450,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it lower. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and might lead Alice to offer a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now gradually increasing his offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to meet Alice halfway. A $425,000 counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, showing Bob's seriousness while still leaving space for further negotiation. This approach aims to secure a price that's favorable while avoiding a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $437,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $437,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $437,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high, as Alice may become more resistant. It's also possible that Alice might offer a higher price in the next round.  It's a good time to accept the offer, as Bob is saving $362,500 compared to buying from John."
