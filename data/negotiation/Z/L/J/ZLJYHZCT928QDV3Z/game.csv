"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $9000 at this point. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's make it happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's close this deal and make it happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9750.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $9750 is still too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $10250. This represents a significant compromise on my end. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know your final decision.",10250.0,Alice,7,
