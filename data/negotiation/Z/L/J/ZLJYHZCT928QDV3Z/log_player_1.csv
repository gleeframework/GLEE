"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Offering a deal:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us to create a positive tone. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message invites Bob to counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Note:** I'm keeping in mind my minimum value ($15,000) and John's offer, but also aiming to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $9000 at this point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum of $15,000, and also less than what John is offering.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** There are still rounds left.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to Bob at $9,000 would result in a significant loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as fair and beneficial for both of us to encourage a positive response. 
* **Creating urgency:** I'm mentioning ""making this deal happen"" to subtly indicate that time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000, and less than what John is offering.
* **Negotiation space:** There are still rounds left. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, there's room for further negotiation to reach a more profitable price.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to Bob at $9,500 would still result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, or even by considering John's offer in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and urgency:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but emphasizing the ""halfway"" aspect to suggest that this is a fair compromise. I also add a sense of urgency by mentioning closing the deal.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the benefits for both of us, aiming to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** $10,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired price point. I'm strategically narrowing the gap. 
* **Balancing risks:**  While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiation, I'm also aware of the risk of John's offer becoming more appealing as time passes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9750.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000, and less than what John is offering. 
* **Limited negotiation space:**  Bob is declaring this his ""final offer,"" which suggests there's limited room for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is attractive:** With only four rounds remaining, John's offer of $15,000 becomes increasingly appealing as the risk of not closing a deal with Bob grows.
* **Potential for better deal:**  While Bob might be at his limit, there's still a chance I could get a better offer from him or secure a deal with John.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will counteroffer to maintain pressure on Bob.  I will also carefully consider John's offer and the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will seriously consider selling to John to avoid further risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This represents a significant compromise on my end. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is my last counteroffer to Bob before seriously considering John's offer.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's final offer, showing flexibility and urgency.
* **Emphasizing compromise:**  I'm highlighting the ""significant compromise"" to emphasize my willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Urgency:**  I'm reiterating ""closing the deal"" to create a sense of finality and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Next steps:**  Depending on Bob's response, I'll be ready to either accept his offer or move on to John."
