Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range where there's potential for negotiation.  $13,000 is a good starting point, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to get a good deal."

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial $18,000, it's still above his maximum budget. He has more negotiating power and can continue to try and drive the price down."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Bob should finally make a counteroffer of $15,000. This is his absolute maximum, and he's essentially calling Alice's bluff. If she's serious about selling, she'll likely accept.  If she rejects, Bob can always buy from John for the same price."
