"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above the minimum I'm willing to accept, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good return. I'm also keeping my message friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,575,000? That would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1575000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,675,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to what I'm hoping to get for the product.  While I could potentially get a bit more, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a good price."
