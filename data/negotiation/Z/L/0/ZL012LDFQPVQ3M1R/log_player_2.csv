"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. He has 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering your profit margin and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $900,000 is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal. He still has several rounds to try and find a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer $875,000. This would be a good compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here.  Let's close this deal - I'm willing to come down to $885,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially ending the deal is high.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
