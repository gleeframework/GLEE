"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $16,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this exceptional product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $17,000. Let's make this deal happen.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, but I'd like to propose a slight premium for the exceptional condition and rarity of the product. How about we settle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point about the condition and rarity, but $17,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $17,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",17250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $17,250, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to ensure I'm getting the value I'm looking for. How about we settle at $17,500, but I'll throw in a special warranty and maintenance package, which is worth $250. This way, you'll get the product at the price you want, and I'll get the value I'm looking for.",17500.0,Alice,7,
