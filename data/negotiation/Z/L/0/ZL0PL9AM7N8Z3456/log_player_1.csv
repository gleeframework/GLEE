Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,750,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* This price is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, making it tempting for Bob to negotiate.
* I'm aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low or if the negotiation process takes too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the next round.
* Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* My counteroffer of **$1,400,000** is a compromise between Bob's offer of $1,200,000 and my initial offer of $1,750,000. 
* This price is still above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but is closer to his offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* It's a reasonable starting point for the next round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* Negotiating further with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I reach my desired profit margin and avoids further negotiation.
* While I might get a slightly higher price in the future, the risk of further negotiations dragging on and potentially resulting in a lower price is too high."
