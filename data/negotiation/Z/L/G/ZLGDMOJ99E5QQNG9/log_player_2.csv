"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. Considering its value, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense in Round 1."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I propose a price of $9,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $8,500.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort in trying to reach an agreement, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. My counteroffer is $8,900 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,900. This is only $400 above Bob's last offer and very close to his ideal price of $8,500.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
