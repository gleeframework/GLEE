"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room to negotiate.  You can likely get a better price than that. You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so you can make a counteroffer closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's also above Alice's minimum acceptable price, so there's a chance she will be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and is likely closer to the true value of the product for Alice.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your offer and you having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
