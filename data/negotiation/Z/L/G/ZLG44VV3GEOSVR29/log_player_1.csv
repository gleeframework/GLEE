"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial benchmark and gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but also want to keep the possibility of a deal with Bob open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm also closely watching how much time I have left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a serious offer and we can reach a deal.  I'm starting to run out of time, so I need to make a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call. I'm running out of rounds and Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price.  I'm choosing to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $800,000.  While I would have loved to get more, I need to secure the sale and can't risk losing the deal completely."
