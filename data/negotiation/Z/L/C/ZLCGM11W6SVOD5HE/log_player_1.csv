Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This doesn't mean he's unwilling to pay more, just that it's his maximum perceived value.
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This is a significant advantage for you.

**Strategy**

The goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay without going so high that he rejects the offer.  We want to leave some room for negotiation but start strong.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and features, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exceptional product"" and ""valuable asset"" reinforce the product's worth.
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming significantly above your minimum. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  This shows flexibility and invites a counter-offer from Bob.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer, and you need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, $800,000 is your absolute floor.
* **Consider Alternatives:**  Depending on how much you value a quick sale, offering a slightly lower price (e.g., $900,000) might be tempting to close the deal faster."
