Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make the offer tempting to Bob. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000. Offering it at $14,000 leaves a significant gap, but it's a starting point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving us a chance to settle closer to our desired price.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at our minimum acceptable price."
