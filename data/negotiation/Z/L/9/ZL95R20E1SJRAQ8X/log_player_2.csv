Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $8,000 at most for my needs. I'm willing to offer you $6,000. It's a fair starting point for negotiation."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $11,000? That's a more reasonable price reflecting its quality and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need you to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price that ensures you get something incredible without undervaluing what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still significantly above your maximum budget and seems to be anchoring her price at $10,000.  You've been steadily increasing your offer, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower given her last message. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
