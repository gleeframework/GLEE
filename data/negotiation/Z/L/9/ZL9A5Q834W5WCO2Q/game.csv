"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $1,150,000? This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
