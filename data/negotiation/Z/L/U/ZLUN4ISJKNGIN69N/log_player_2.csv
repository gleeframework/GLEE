"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price.  Since we have 10 rounds, rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully encourages Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's still early in the negotiation process, and I have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to meet her current price.  By moving closer to her offer, I hope to encourage her to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal.  Since I have the option to buy from John for $10,000, I'm not in a rush to accept any offer that's higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm offering Alice her minimum acceptable price.  If she rejects this offer, I'll move on to buying from John. I'm confident that Alice will accept this offer as it's her minimum desired price."
