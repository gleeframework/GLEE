"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,200,000. Considering its worth to you, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  Alice is already offering a discount, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me, I need to maintain a reasonable margin. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I believe you'll still get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and the price is now within a range that is still a good deal for you.  It's worth accepting her offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more to John."
