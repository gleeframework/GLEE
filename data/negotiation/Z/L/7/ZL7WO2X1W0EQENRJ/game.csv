"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's my absolute limit. Can you consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1000000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $1150000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do at this point.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
