Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite high, and I have room to negotiate.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm hoping to find a price that's a bit more in line with my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1200000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a lower price.  I'm not yet ready to buy from John at $1,500,000, so I'll keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
