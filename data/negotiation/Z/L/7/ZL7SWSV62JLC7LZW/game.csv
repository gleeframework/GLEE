"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still allows you to make a good profit, and it's a fair price for this valuable product. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be reasonable.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $1,050,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's close this deal before we run out of time!",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. How about we meet at $1,075,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal now!",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I need to be honest with you, Alice, I'm starting to think about buying the product from John for $1,000,000. Can you meet me at $1,075,000 or is that really your final offer?",1075000.0,Bob,8,
