Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell for $900,000 yet, as it's below my minimum threshold. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still allows you to make a good profit, and it's a fair price for this valuable product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $1,050,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's close this deal before we run out of time!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. How about we meet at $1,075,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,075,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm determined to secure a price closer to $1,100,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I need to be honest with you, Alice, I'm starting to think about buying the product from John for $1,000,000. Can you meet me at $1,075,000 or is that really your final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly showing signs of going to John, and his offer is still below my desired price.  It's not worth risking a lower offer and losing the sale completely.  Selling to John will secure the minimum amount I'm willing to accept and ensures I don't end up with nothing."
