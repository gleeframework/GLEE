I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$10,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for that price.  I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $17,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, $12,000 is still too low.  John offers a safe and secure $15,000.  I'll take it."
