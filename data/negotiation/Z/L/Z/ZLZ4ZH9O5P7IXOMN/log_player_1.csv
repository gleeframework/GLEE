Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's in excellent condition and would be a great addition to your collection. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm willing to try and get a bit more. I have 9 rounds left and can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $17,000? It's a fair price for a product in excellent condition."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $16,250. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. We've already had a few rounds, and I can afford to keep negotiating.  I believe I can get closer to my goal of $17,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $16,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $16,500? It's a small step closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm ready to close the deal at $16,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price of $17,000, Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good deal.  We've already had several rounds of negotiation, and with only four rounds left, it's getting risky to keep pushing for a higher price. I'm confident that accepting this offer will secure a good profit and save time."
