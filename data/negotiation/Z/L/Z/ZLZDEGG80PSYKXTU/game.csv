"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm getting closer, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your patience.  I'm willing to move a bit. How about $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to move a bit, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and $9,800, which would be $9,975. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9975.0,Alice,7,
