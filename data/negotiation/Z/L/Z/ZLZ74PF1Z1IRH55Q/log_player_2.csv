"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value ($12,000 vs. $10,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Your maximum value is $15,000.** You have a significant buffer before needing to buy from John.

By rejecting the offer, you open the opportunity to negotiate a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $11,500.** This is still within my budget and a better price than buying from John. 
* **I'm not sure how much lower Alice will go.**  Further negotiation may result in a lower price, but there's also a risk she'll reject my counteroffer.
* **There's a risk of getting stuck with the $15,000 price from John if I keep rejecting offers.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $11,500 is a reasonable compromise that secures the product within my budget without risking a higher price from John."
