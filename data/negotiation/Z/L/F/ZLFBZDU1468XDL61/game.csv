"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's in excellent condition and a great value for the price.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,750. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Can you consider that price?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $10,750. How about we split the difference and go with $11,125? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's get this deal done!",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
