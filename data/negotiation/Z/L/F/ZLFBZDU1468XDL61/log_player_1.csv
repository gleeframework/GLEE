"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,750. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there at $10,750. How about we split the difference and go with $11,125? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 11125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $11,000 is close enough to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a sale now than to potentially lose out on any sale at all."
