I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $950,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his attempt to meet me halfway, $980,000 is still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offers are getting increasingly close to my minimum price.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
