Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is both reasonable for me and allows for some room to bargain if needed.  I'm also emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate to make it more likely Bob will accept or at least counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $120?  This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise for me."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me try one last time. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial counteroffer.  It's not ideal, but it's still a better deal than selling to John. It's possible I could get him to go higher, but the risk of him walking away and me being stuck with the lower price from John is too high.  I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
