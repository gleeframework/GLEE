"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $1250000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1275000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much value.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a price of $1225000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1200000? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
