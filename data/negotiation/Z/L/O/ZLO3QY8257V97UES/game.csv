"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $175 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives us room to work with.  What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While I'm open to negotiating, $137.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $146.25. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",146.25,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. $140 is getting closer to what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference and go with $143. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",143.0,Alice,7,
