{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000,  aiming slightly lower than that with Bob allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and positions it as a premium opportunity. This price gives Bob a significant discount compared to your alternative offer while still netting you a substantial profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. You can always slightly lower the price to reach an agreement that still benefits you more than selling to John."
