Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still a significant markup from Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to counter again to see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

``` 

I'm countering with $16,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're close to a deal and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum price. While I would prefer to sell for more, it's close enough to my target that it's worth accepting.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him, and I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
