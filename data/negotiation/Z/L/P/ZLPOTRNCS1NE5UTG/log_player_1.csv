(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1325000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him and ending up with John's offer, which is less than what I'd like to receive."
