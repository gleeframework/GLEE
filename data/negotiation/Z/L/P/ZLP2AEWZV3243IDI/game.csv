"I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is simply too low for me. I understand your position, but my minimum selling price is $11000. This still allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10500. I think that's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
