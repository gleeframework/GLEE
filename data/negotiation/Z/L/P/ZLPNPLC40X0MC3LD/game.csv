"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product to your specific business model is significant, and $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. Let's meet in the middle on this one.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,375,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
