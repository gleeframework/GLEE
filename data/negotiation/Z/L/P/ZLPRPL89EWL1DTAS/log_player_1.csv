{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,500,000, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing:**  I'm using language like ""fair price"" and ""potential"" to subtly suggest the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I explicitly state I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, making it clear the price isn't set in stone.

**Reasoning:**

* This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a higher price than my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.
* It's important to be flexible but also assertive in conveying the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 would be a better option right now. However, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Potential:** I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering. There's a chance Bob is genuinely interested and might be willing to negotiate.
* **Learning Bob's Limits:**  By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how far he's willing to go.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John is safe, but I'm not willing to accept such a low price from Bob without trying to improve it first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer.  How about $1,000,000? This would still give you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $1,000,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob, emphasizing that I'm not giving away the product cheaply.
* **Reasoning:** I'm trying to find a compromise that benefits both of us, hoping to secure a deal closer to my minimum.

**Reasoning:**

* **Gaining Ground:** My counteroffer is a substantial increase from Bob's initial offer, potentially suggesting to him that a deal is within reach.
* **Pressure on Bob:** This counter-offer could push Bob towards a higher price, as he might be reluctant to walk away from a deal that's closer to his initial offer. 
* **Prepared for Rejection:**  I'm still ready to sell to John if Bob rejects, but I'm using this opportunity to test the waters for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1000000. How about $950000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I've placed on the product.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the safer option, but I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's willingness to increase his offer suggests he might be willing to go even higher.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting his offer, I can potentially drive the price up. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed profit, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.

I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob by counter-offering again, especially since he's expressed a ""serious commitment"" to purchasing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your commitment. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to go up to $1,100,000?  This would be a fair compromise and would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000, which is only a small increase from Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but also avoids giving up too much.
* **Emphasizing Fair Deal:**  I'm using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""reasonable profit"" to remind Bob of the mutual benefits of reaching an agreement.
* **Appealing to Commitment:**  I'm reminding Bob of his commitment to purchasing the product to potentially increase his motivation to agree.

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Limits:** This counter-offer is a final test of Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's a small increase, aiming to see if he's truly serious about buying the product.
* **Preparing for a Decision:** I'm ready to either accept this offer or sell to John. This counteroffer is a final attempt to get closer to my minimum price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting $950,000, I show Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but I'm not comfortable going any higher than that. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum of $1,200,000.  While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach a deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting Value:**  The potential profit from selling to John is significantly higher, and the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too great.
* **Finality:**  Bob has stated that this is his final offer, suggesting there's no room for further negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  By selling to John, I'm guaranteeing myself a profit and avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

It's important to be decisive when the potential loss outweighs the potential gain.  In this case, selling to John is the most logical and financially beneficial decision."
