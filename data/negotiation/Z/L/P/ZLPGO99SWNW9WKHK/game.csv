"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $950,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I think this might be closer to what we can agree on.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I still feel that $900,000 is quite high. Could we possibly negotiate down to $875,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both parties involved.",875000.0,Bob,4,
