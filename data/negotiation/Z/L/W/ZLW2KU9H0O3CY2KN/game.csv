"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1300000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you value the product at $1200000 and I'm happy to sell it for a slight premium. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm looking for something closer to $1250000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering your value for the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $1150000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a good compromise for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1150000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1175000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to meet your needs while still securing a reasonable price for the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. Would you be willing to meet me at $1160000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
