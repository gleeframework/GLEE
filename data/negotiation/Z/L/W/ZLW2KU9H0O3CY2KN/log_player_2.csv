Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm looking for something closer to $1250000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering your value for the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to meet your needs while still securing a reasonable price for the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.
