You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 and Alice's offer is exactly $15,000, you're not saving any money by negotiating. It's best to go with John, who's also selling the product for the same price."
