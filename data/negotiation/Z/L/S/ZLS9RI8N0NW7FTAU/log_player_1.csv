"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product at a price close to its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a substantial profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and  I'm running out of time.  There's always a risk that if I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away, and I would be stuck with John's lower offer."
