"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,200,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not quite comfortable with the $700,000 price point. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm not quite ready to accept $775,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stalled at $825,000 for two rounds.  This suggests she's reached her lower limit.  While we could push for a slightly better price, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible. Accepting now secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
