"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,200,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not quite comfortable with the $700,000 price point. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
