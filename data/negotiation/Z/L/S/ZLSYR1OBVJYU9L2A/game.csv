"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $600,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us to find a price that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",675000.0,Alice,5,
