Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $600,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 700000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise.
