"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 
 Here's the reasoning:

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation while anchoring the discussion around a high number.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus towards the perceived benefits.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: Creating a sense of scarcity and exclusivity can make the product seem more desirable.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a better deal. Accepting $900,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table, especially knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't fully reflect the true potential and uniqueness of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its inherent value while still providing you with a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective, showing I'm engaged in the negotiation process.
* **Standing Firm (For Now):** I'm only reducing my price by a small amount.  This signals that I'm serious about the value and not willing to make drastic concessions quickly.
* **Focus on ""Potential"":** I'm reiterating the ""potential"" of the product, subtly suggesting that its value might be even higher than Bob's current assessment. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""acknowledging its value"" frames my offer as a balanced solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances your desired price with my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting $1,050,000 is a strong profit, exceeding my minimum price by $50,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. This offer represents a solid compromise and a significant return."
