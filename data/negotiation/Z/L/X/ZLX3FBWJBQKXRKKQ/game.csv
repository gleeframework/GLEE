"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't fully reflect the true potential and uniqueness of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its inherent value while still providing you with a significant return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
