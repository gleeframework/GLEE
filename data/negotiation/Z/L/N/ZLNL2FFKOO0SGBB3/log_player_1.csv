"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to get a higher price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in hopes of getting a better deal. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to do that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I have more rounds left and I believe there's potential for a more profitable deal. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,100 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I have four rounds left and believe there's room for a final push to get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I want to maximize my potential earnings with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $9,150. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 9150}
