"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been working on for a long time, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  This is a special price, as I value our relationship and believe in the potential of this product for you.  Please let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is attractive, it exceeds his maximum budget of $10,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can purchase the product from John for $10,000, staying within his budget."
