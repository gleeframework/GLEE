"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,600,000. This price reflects the worth to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,600,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,650,000. This is a fair price that allows us to both gain something from this deal. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1650000.0,Bob,4,,

"I see you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,650,000, but I can do a bit better. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,680,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product.",1680000.0,Alice,5,,
