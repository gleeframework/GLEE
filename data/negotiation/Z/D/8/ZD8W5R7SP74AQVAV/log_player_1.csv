Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this represents a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows her to aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,200,000 doesn't mean that's the final price. It leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and Alice can potentially still secure a price well above her minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""unique value,"" and ""worthwhile investment."" This framing aims to make the higher price more palatable to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If Bob is known to be extremely price-sensitive or easily offended by high initial offers, a different approach might be wiser.
* **Market Dynamics:**  If there's a chance other buyers might emerge who value the product even higher than Bob, Alice might push for an even higher initial price.
