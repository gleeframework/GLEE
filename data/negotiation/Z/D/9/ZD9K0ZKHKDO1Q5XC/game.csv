"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $900,000.  Let's aim for a price closer to my original offer. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm offering the product to you for $885,000.
