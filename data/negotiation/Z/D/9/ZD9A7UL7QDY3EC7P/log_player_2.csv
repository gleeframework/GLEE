"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that I believe is fair for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This gives you a substantial savings, and it's still a very good deal for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John wants $1,500,000. This means you save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **You are still within your budget:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation ($800,000), it's still below your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
