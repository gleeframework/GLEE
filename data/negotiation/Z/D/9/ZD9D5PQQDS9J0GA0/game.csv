"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a new price of $870,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.",870000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to keep negotiating. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",860000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still negotiating. However, I'm not willing to accept $860,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm proposing a new price of $863,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",863000.0,Alice,7,
