"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $800,000 to me, and I believe it holds similar value for you. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $750,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  $725,000 is getting closer. However, I'm still holding out for a bit more to ensure I'm comfortable with the final price. How about we compromise at $740,000? This feels like a fair meeting point given the value of the product and the progress we've made.",740000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I think $730,000 is a reasonable offer. It reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",730000.0,Bob,6,
