{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is incredibly valuable, worth at least a million dollars to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a significant discount considering its true worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It also frames the offer as a ""discount"" to emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand $1,200,000 is a significant amount, this product truly holds immense value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering its potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $1215000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,215,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,215,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure how much more he's willing to budge.  It's a risk, but accepting this offer ensures a sale and a significant profit."
