"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $9,500 is better than Alice's asking price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He's only willing to pay $8,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob should start by offering a price that's closer to his maximum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  $8,500 is a good starting point, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also that he's not going to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to his target price, he still has some leverage. He has the option to buy from John for a lower price, and Alice has already rejected his counteroffer. This shows that she is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. $8,750 is a good middle ground, and it's possible that Alice will be willing to accept it to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's only willing to pay $8,000, and Alice is still asking for more than that. While it's getting close, he still has the option to buy from John for a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

Bob should try to push his luck and make a lower counteroffer. Since Alice has already rejected a price of $8,750, Bob is likely to get her to agree to a price below his maximum of $8,000.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still giving him some room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He has only a few rounds left, and Alice is still unwilling to come down to his target price of $8,000.  While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation when he has a guaranteed deal with John for his desired price."
