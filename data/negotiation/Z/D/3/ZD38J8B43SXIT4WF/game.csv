"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to only pay up to $8000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below what I can realistically accept.  I'm willing to come down to $12000 to facilitate a deal.  This price still reflects the product's value, but also allows for some flexibility.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I am still unable to meet at $12000. I would like to propose $10000 as a compromise, acknowledging the product's value while staying within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
