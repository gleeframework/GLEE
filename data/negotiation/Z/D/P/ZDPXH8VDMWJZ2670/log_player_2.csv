"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your $100 limit and even above her own valuation. John offers the product at your maximum price, making it the best choice."
