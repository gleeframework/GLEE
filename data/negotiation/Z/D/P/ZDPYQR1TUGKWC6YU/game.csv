"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've valued at no less than $800,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $900,000. This would be a win-win for both of us, as it would be a significant value for you and a substantial profit for me.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
