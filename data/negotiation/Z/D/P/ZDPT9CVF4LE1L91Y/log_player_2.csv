"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While buying from John is a safe option, there's no harm in trying to negotiate with Alice first. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, there's potential to get a better price if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer of $130 is a reasonable starting point. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating, but it leaves room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $140, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $150.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of the deal falling through."
