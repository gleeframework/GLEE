"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to let you have it for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum willingness to pay ($120) and also a better deal than buying from John. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
