Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value. I'll be ready to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum value of $100. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum value of $100.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it seems like we're getting stuck in a stalemate. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $100."
