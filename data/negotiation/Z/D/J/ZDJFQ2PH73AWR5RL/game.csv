"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can you meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you were thinking of $1000000, but I'm not quite comfortable meeting you at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still confident that this product will bring you significant value in the long run. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is at least $800000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1020000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1020000. I'd be willing to meet you at $990000. Can you consider that?",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I can offer it to you for $1015000. This is my last concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price, Alice, but I'm really struggling to go above $990000. I'd be willing to meet you at $995000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",995000.0,Bob,10,
