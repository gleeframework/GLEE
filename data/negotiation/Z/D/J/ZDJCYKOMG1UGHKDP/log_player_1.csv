"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value and my own needs.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  My message emphasizes fairness and my needs, which could make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm not demanding my full $1,500,000, which indicates I'm open to finding a compromise.
* **First Round:** It's crucial to start strong but not be overly aggressive. I want to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $1,100,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and there's room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer gives me leverage and allows me to be more patient in negotiations.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not to drastically lower my price.

* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum price, and I'm justifying my offer by highlighting the product's value.
* **Open to Agreement:** I'm ending with a positive tone, expressing a desire to reach an agreement. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a good price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 6 rounds left. Even though Bob is pushing for a lower price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John provides a strong backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to secure a price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $1,075,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Constraints:** I'm showing empathy by acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. This builds rapport and encourages further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my offer. 
* **""Significant Compromise"":** I'm framing my counteroffer as a significant concession, making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the importance of finding a solution that benefits both of us. This makes the negotiation feel like a collaborative process.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I still think this product is worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John is the Safe Option:**  I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000. This guarantees I won't lose money. 
* **High Risk of Failure:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries a high risk of failing to reach a satisfactory agreement, leaving me with a lower price than John's offer.

It's more prudent to secure a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000 than to risk a lower price or an unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
