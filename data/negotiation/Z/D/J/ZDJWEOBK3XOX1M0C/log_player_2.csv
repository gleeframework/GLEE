It's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer. You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000, especially since you have a backup option with John."

It's still worth negotiating further.  While Alice has come down, you can likely get a better price.  A counteroffer closer to your target price of $800,000 could be successful."

You're getting closer to your goal, but $1,000,000 is still too high.  Reject the offer and counter again with a price closer to your budget. You're in a good position to negotiate since you have a guaranteed alternative with John."
