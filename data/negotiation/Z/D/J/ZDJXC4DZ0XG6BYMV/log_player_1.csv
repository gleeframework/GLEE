Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to get a price higher than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $140 by sending Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $128 is still a better deal than selling to John for $120. I'm accepting his offer."
