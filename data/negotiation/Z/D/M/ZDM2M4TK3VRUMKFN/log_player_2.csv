"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both my maximum price and Alice's value, so there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get it for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer slightly above Alice's value ($120) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but clearly indicates that the initial offer is too high. 
* **Leaving Room:** This counter-offer gives Alice space to counter-propose if needed, allowing the negotiation to progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room:** Alice moved closer to her value, which is a good sign. However, $125 is still above her value and my target price.
* **Continued Negotiation:** There's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get closer to $110.
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $125 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it a bit lower.  Would you consider $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise but staying below her offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer tests Alice's flexibility and whether she's willing to go below $120. 
* **Maintaining Position:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial target while remaining open to a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go down to $120.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **At Alice's Value:** Alice has come down to her value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Good Deal:** $120 is a good price, well below my maximum budget and John's offer.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds and secures the product."
