"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if you're interested!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $900,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",975000.0,Alice,5,
