Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? "", ""product_price"": 10250}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $9,750. That's still a good price for you, and a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750.

``` 

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my minimum that it's not worth risking the deal for a potentially small gain.  It's better to secure the $9,750 profit than to risk losing the sale entirely."
