"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she's offering it at that price, there's no room for negotiation. Buying from John for the same price is the best option, as it guarantees you get the product without any risk of a failed negotiation."
