"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I believe it's worth at least $8,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $7,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,250 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
