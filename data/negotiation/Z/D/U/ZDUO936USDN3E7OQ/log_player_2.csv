"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product while still giving her some room for profit. This aggressive counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation and aims to quickly narrow the price gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point. Even though Bob's initial counteroffer was rejected, Alice's counter-counteroffer shows that she is willing to negotiate further.  There's still room to push for a lower price, and Bob should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while keeping it below Alice's previous offer. This approach maintains pressure on Alice and signals a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While the gap is narrowing, Bob is determined to get the best price possible. He has already rejected three offers and is still within his budget. Continuing the negotiation could potentially yield a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time it's only by $50,000. This demonstrates that he's approaching Alice's last offer and is getting closer to a potential agreement. He's still aiming for a lower price but acknowledging that further concessions may be necessary. This smaller increment shows he's serious about reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now equal to the price offered by John.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, there is no benefit to continuing the negotiation with Alice. Buying from John guarantees a known price within Bob's budget, even though it's not the most ideal price.  There's no chance of getting a better deal from Alice, and the remaining rounds are too risky."
