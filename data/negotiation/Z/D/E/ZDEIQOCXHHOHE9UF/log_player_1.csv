"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still within a reasonable range given my minimum desired price ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm starting with a friendly and positive message to establish good communication from the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,250,000 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,250,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Time for a counteroffer:**  I still have time (9 rounds left) to continue negotiating with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer,  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still significantly less than my initial offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm reducing my price but staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Show Flexibility:**  By reducing my price, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that my counteroffer is still a good deal for him. 
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I am still working within my budget and am willing to pay up to $1,450,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **More Negotiation Potential:**  We're still within a range where negotiation is possible, and I have a few more rounds to potentially secure a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Balancing Risk:** While John's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, I have a chance to get a better deal with Bob.  If I sell to John now, I forgo the potential to earn more.  

**Next Steps:** 

I'll likely make a counteroffer closer to $1,480,000 or $1,490,000 in the next round, seeing if I can close the gap and secure a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  your offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for. How about $1,480,000?  This would allow us both to get a fair deal and close this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1480000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close the Gap:** I'm offering a price only $30,000 below Bob's last offer, showing I'm serious about finding a solution.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** I'm still slightly above my minimum price, leaving room for a final negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the communication positive.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider lowering my price by a smaller increment, or even accepting his offer if we're close enough. However, I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John if a deal with Bob doesn't materialize."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I am willing to consider $1,460,000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,460,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,460,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,460,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 6, leaving only 4 more rounds to negotiate.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I keep rejecting offers, I risk Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with only John as a buyer.
* **Potential for Future Deal:** While this offer is slightly below my desired price, it's still a significant sum, and there's always the possibility of future business with Bob if he proves to be a reliable client.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at this stage is the most logical decision. It secures a substantial sum and minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely."
