"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to start at $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is still higher than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a slightly higher price that reflects the value this product brings to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to you, but it's closer to your maximum budget. It's a good compromise and a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
