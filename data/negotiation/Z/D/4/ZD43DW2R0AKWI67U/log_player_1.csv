Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
