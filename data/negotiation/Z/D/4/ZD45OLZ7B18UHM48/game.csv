"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the product's true worth.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,350,000 is still outside my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is a price I believe is fair, considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but this is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and understand your need to get a fair price. While $1,275,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,225,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and hopefully is a price we can both agree on.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
