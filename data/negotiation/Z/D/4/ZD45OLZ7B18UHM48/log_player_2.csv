Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, and if not, buying from John for $1,200,000 is still a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and understand your need to get a fair price. While $1,275,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too high for me.
