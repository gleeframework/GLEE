"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell.  You can reject this offer and see if she comes back with a lower price."
