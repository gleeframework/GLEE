"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500.  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and will come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price. I could continue negotiating, but I've already had several rounds and there's a good chance he won't budge further. To avoid the risk of further negotiation failures and the possibility of ending up with nothing, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. This guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
