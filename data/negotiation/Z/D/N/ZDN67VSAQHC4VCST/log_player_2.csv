"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This is a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is slightly below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her first offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to $10,000, saving you even more money."
