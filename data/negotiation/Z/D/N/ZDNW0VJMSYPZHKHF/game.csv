"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay $7,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point. Let's split the difference and go with $8,000. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",9200.0,Alice,5,
