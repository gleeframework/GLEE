"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll be happy with this price, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for less than $14,000.  Since Alice values the product at $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,800, which is still a good deal for Bob. He can buy the product for $1,200 less than what he would pay John. While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much lower, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal completely."
