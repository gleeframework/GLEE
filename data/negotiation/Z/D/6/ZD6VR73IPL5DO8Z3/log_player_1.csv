""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves a $200,000 potential profit margin to negotiate within.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 creates a significant incentive for Bob (saving him $75,000) while still securing a substantial profit for you ($125,000 above your minimum). 

This offer aims to balance maximizing profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept."
