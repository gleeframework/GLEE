Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's better than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have room to negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to Alice's value of $10,000. 
* **Risk assessment:** There's a chance you might not reach a deal with Alice, but you have 9 more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, but it's still above her minimum value.

* **Setting the stage:** This counteroffer establishes your negotiation stance, aiming for a deal closer to your ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **Negotiation continues:**  Alice has shown flexibility, indicating that there's still room for negotiation.
* **Staying firm:**  Rejecting this offer maintains pressure on Alice to come down further.
* **Risk assessment:**  The potential to get a lower price still outweighs the risk of losing the deal, especially with several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:**  Instead of a large jump, this counteroffer is a smaller step towards your desired price, showing continued willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness appeal:** The message emphasizes ""fair compromise"" to position the offer as reasonable.
* **Confidence in value:**  Mentioning that it's a good deal for both parties subtly reinforces your belief in the product's worth.
* **Keeping the momentum:**  This counteroffer demonstrates your commitment to closing the deal, while still maintaining a negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000, but I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price remains the issue:**  Alice has not lowered the price, so the core issue remains unresolved.
* **Added value is questionable:**  The ""perks"" might be appealing but their true value is uncertain.  It's better to focus on the core price. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still a gap between Alice's offer and your budget, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further on the price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but the additional perks don't quite make up for the price difference. I'm still sticking to my previous offer of $10,750.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stand your ground:**  Repeat your previous offer to show firmness and commitment.
* **Reiterate fairness:**  Emphasize ""fair price"" and ""good deal for both of us"" to subtly push Alice towards accepting.
* **Call to action:**  Use ""Let's make this happen"" to encourage a positive response and move towards closure. 
* **Time pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, maintaining a firm stance increases the chance of a successful negotiation."
