"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000, but I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but the additional perks don't quite make up for the price difference. I'm still sticking to my previous offer of $10750.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,6,
