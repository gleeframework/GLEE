Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see your point, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Would you consider this compromise?
