"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with it. I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's too early to buy from John, as I want to explore if I can get a better deal from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for me, as I'm only willing to go up to $800,000. I will counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see your point, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Would you consider this compromise?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. Let's find a solution here. How about we settle on $1,025,000?  That's a substantial reduction on my part and brings us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above my budget. I'm committed to getting the product for as close to $800,000 as possible. I will counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  While I see this price is getting closer to what I can afford, $1,025,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope this will be acceptable to you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
