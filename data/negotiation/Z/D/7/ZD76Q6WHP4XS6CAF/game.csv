"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with it. I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see your point, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Would you consider this compromise?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. Let's find a solution here. How about we settle on $1,025,000?  That's a substantial reduction on my part and brings us closer to a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  While I see this price is getting closer to what I can afford, $1,025,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope this will be acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,6,
