Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high offer.

{""product_price"": 15,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my minimum price.
