# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the profit I'm willing to make.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $925,000 is still a little steep for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This gives you a significant profit, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $850,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product to you and gives me a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $875,000. This is a good price for Bob, considering his goal is to save as much money as possible.  He can get the product for a significant discount compared to John's price ($1,200,000) and it's still a reasonable profit for Alice.  It's a win-win situation and Bob should accept the offer."
