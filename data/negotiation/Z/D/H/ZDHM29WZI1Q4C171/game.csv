"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value to me and gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the profit I'm willing to make. Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $925,000 is still a little steep for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This gives you a significant profit, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $850,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product to you and gives me a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",875000.0,Alice,5,
