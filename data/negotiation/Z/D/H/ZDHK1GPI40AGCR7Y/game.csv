"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,200,000 is way above my budget. While I see the potential in this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on this product, $1,750,000 is still out of my range. Let's try $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this opportunity.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to consider a significant reduction to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair price given its potential.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
