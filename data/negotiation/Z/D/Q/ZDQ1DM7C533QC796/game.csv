"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs perfectly, just like it did for me. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $120 for it. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both the product's worth and your budget.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the explanation of the product's value, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, considering its value to me.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $105 for the product. This allows us to find a balance between respecting the product's value and accommodating your financial situation.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",97.5,Bob,4,
