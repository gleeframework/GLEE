Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price can make it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $115, I have space to potentially go down in price if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to get a better deal. I'll try to meet him halfway between our previous positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Clear and Concise:**  The offer is straightforward and easy for Bob to understand. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm not dropping the price too drastically, signaling that I believe in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer, Alice. I could do $108, but that's really pushing it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $108 is still a good profit margin, exceeding my minimum price by $8.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might irritate Bob or risk losing the sale altogether. The potential gain from further negotiation is small compared to the risk. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids prolonging the negotiation process."
