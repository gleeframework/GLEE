Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,150,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to gain significant value. I believe this price is fair, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I want to see if I can push him closer to my initial offer.  Selling to John right now would be a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1,050,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant advantage, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
