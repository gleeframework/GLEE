,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting a little frustrated with this back and forth. While I appreciate your negotiating skills, I'm only willing to go down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",115.0,Alice,7,
