"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to make a reasonable profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
