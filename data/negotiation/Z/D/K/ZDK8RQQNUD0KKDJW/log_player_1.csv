Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's also reasonable to assume that he may be willing to pay even more if I pushed further. However, there's a risk he might reject a counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale.  Accepting his offer is the best option to guarantee a sale and a profit."
