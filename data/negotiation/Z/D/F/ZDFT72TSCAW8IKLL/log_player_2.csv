Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not convinced that $880,000 is sufficient for the product's value.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a discount:** $900,000 is a $100,000 saving compared to John's offer.
* **Alice is firm:** She's indicated this is her final offer, suggesting she won't go lower.
* **Time is ticking:**  You have fewer rounds left, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. 

While you could try to push Alice further, there's a risk she won't budge, and you'll end up paying John's full price. Accepting the $900,000 secures a good deal now."
