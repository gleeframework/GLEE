Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be of great value to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $100 allows for some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering too low a price (close to your minimum of $80)  might discourage Bob and make him think the product isn't valuable. 

This strategy aims for a win-win situation. Bob gets the product for less than his perceived value, and you make a significant profit above your minimum."
