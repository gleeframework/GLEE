I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $130 is close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is the lowest I can go right now.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer for $135.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, it's getting late in the negotiation and it's above my minimum. It's better to get a good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
