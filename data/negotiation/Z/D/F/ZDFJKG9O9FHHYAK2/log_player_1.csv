"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and slightly higher than what it's worth to Bob ($80). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positivity:**  I'm using positive language to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob an open-ended question to encourage a response and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better offer than Bob's first counteroffer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is fair for both of us. This helps to build trust and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is a good final price, hinting that I may not budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product, but no more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'm still hopeful that I can get a price closer to my target of $100. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $92 is just a little too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $96. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 96}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Understanding:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts to get a good price to show empathy and build rapport.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting him halfway between my last offer and his last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal and suggesting this is a fair final price.

**Important Note:** I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding out for a little more. I'm hoping Bob will accept my offer, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $94 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $94 is just $6 away from my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could keep negotiating, I'm starting to run out of rounds. I've already compromised significantly, and there's a good chance Bob won't budge much further.  To guarantee a sale at a reasonable price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. This is a safe and secure option, and it ensures I won't lose out on a good deal."
