"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer is a terrible deal! It's way more than your $10,000 limit and even higher than her own valuation. John is offering a much better price.
