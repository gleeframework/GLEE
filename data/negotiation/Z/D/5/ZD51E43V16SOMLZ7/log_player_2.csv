"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $2,000 by negotiating with Alice.  Even if the negotiation goes poorly, he can still buy from John as a backup, so there's no risk in rejecting the initial offer and trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000 but also wants to leave some room for negotiation. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget and saves him $2,500 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice, securing a good deal with minimal risk."
