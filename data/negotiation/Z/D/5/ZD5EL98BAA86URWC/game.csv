"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's definitely closer to what I was hoping for.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
