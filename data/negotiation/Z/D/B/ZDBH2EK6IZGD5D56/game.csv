"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,375,000. This is a compromise that gets us closer to a deal. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's my final offer. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
