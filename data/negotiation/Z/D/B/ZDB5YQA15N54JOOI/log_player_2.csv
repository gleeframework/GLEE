Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting allows me to start the negotiation process and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  This product is very valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and I'm happy to save $50,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
