"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",980000.0,Bob,4,
