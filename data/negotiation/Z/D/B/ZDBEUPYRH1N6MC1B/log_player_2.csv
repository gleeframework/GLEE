"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, there's potential to get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down significantly. Offering $10,000 is a considerable drop from Alice's initial offer, showing his willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000?  This still gives you a significant savings compared to what the product is worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's first offer, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives him the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price.  He has several rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more measured approach this time.  He's not going for a drastic price drop, but a smaller increment to show good faith and signal that he's getting close to a deal.  $10,500 is a reasonable compromise, showing he's willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is getting close:**  Alice is now offering $11,000, which is only $500 more than Bob's last offer. This shows a clear willingness to compromise.
* **Time is running out:** Bob has already used 4 rounds, and there are only 6 left.  If he rejects this offer, he risks losing the opportunity to get a good deal from Alice and may have to buy from John at a significantly higher price.
* **Value is still good:**  Even at $11,000, Bob is still saving $4,000 compared to John's price.  

Accepting the offer secures a good deal and minimizes the risk of having to buy at a higher price later."
