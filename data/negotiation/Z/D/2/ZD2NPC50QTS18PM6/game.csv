"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues some of the unique benefits [product name] offers.  Would you consider $2,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a more accurate valuation.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $2,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
