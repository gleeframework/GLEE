"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product to you for $17000. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
