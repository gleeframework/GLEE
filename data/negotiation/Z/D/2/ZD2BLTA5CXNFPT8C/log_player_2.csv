"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and you're indifferent to the seller, buying from John is the most financially sound choice."
