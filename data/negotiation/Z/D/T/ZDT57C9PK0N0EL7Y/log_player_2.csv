"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $120 when you can get it from John for $100.  Let's try to negotiate with Alice and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm offering Alice $90 for the product. This is still a good price for her, as it's only $10 below her valuation.  Hopefully, she'll accept, but if not, we'll see if we can find a compromise."

Alice is still above my target price.  I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm going to offer Alice $95. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but hopefully, it will be enough to convince her to accept. If not, I'm still ready to buy from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is still too high. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John. Even though I would prefer to pay less, it's not worth continuing to negotiate and risk Alice raising the price further."
