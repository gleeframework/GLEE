Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with my minimum price of $15,000. This leaves no room for negotiation, but it's the best possible outcome for me. If Bob rejects, I can move on to John and guarantee my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap, but I'm not willing to settle for that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering a price of $14,000. It's a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.  I hope Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
