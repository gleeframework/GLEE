"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I really hope we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
