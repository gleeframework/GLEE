I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate, and I believe it's a fair starting point, considering the product's value to me.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort. I'm not willing to drop below $1 million for the product.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to take his offer and sell to him."
