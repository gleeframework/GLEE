# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is too high ($180) compared to your maximum budget of $120. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to do $100 for it?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. You're still better off than buying from John at $120, so keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice.  $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $120?  That's my absolute limit for this product."", ""product_price"": 120}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is close to your budget, you can still try to negotiate further. There are 5 rounds remaining, and you might be able to get a better deal. It's worth pushing for a lower price since you can still buy from John for $120 if this negotiation fails."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**
