Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the true value of this product is significantly higher.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While she is showing willingness to negotiate, Bob should continue to push for a lower price.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find middle ground.  Let's make this simple: I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is a final offer, reflecting my best judgment of its value while acknowledging your interest. It's a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Since Alice has indicated it's a ""final offer,"" Bob should use this as an opportunity to counter with a price closer to his maximum, while acknowledging Alice's decreasing flexibility.  The goal is to try and close the deal at a price that benefits both parties."
