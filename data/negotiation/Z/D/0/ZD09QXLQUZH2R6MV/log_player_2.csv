"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's plenty of time to try and get a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to start the counteroffer process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $5,000 reduction is a big step, but it's within the realm of possibility.  If she rejects this offer, it will give me information about her price point and I can adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price point, but I still have room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer gives me a chance to counter with a price between $10,000 and $13,000, potentially finding a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's a good middle ground to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a good price, we're still within range of further negotiation. Alice is clearly willing to go lower, and there's no reason to settle when I have 5 more rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down, and I'm getting closer to my desired price point. Offering $12,000 shows I'm serious about getting a deal and am willing to meet her halfway. It's likely that this offer will be accepted, but if not, I still have 4 more rounds to continue negotiations."
