Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 price gives Bob enough room to feel like he's getting a good deal while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
