Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, while still leaving me room to earn more than my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation."
