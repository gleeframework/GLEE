"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $15,000. This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

Bob is trying to get the best price possible. Offering $11,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's still above Alice's minimum of $10,000 and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $12,000. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer is still below Alice's previous offer and closer to his desired price.  It's a reasonable middle ground to see if they can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his preferred limit. It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if Bob can squeeze out a bit more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This counteroffer is Bob's final push. It's still above Alice's minimum, but it's the highest price Bob is willing to pay. If Alice rejects, Bob will purchase from John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum price. At this point, it's better for Bob to purchase the product from John for $12,000, as this is the best price he can get without risking further negotiation."
