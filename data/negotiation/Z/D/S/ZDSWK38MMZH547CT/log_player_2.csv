Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum budget of $10,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it still leaves room for Alice to negotiate if she's willing to come down a bit more.  If she rejects this offer, I'm ready to buy from John."
