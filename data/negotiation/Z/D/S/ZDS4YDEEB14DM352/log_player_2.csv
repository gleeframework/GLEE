"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be beneficial for you to own it. My first offer is $95, hoping to reach a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is close to my maximum, but there's still room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a little steep for my budget right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?"",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming for a significant discount, so starting with a much lower offer ($75) creates more room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the conversation going smoothly.  
* **Justification:** Briefly mentioning my budget adds a touch of realism to my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider $80 as the product price. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved closer to my price, which is a good sign. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to her offer to show I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $78, I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($75) and her counteroffer ($80). This shows I'm willing to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Fairness:**  Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" reinforces the idea that I'm looking for a win-win solution.
* **Continued Interest:** My tone remains positive and engaged, indicating I'm still serious about purchasing the product."
