{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,200,000 is less than $1,500,000. 
* **You're still saving money:** You're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product while saving $300,000 compared to buying from John."
