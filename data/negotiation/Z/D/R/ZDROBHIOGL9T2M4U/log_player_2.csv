# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your counteroffer of $650,000, I'd like to counter with $750,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.

{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I can appreciate you holding onto its value.  To be honest,  $725,000 is a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $712,500?"",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $712,500 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering your offer, I'd like to counter with $720,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $712,500.  Continuing to push for a lower price might irritate her and jeopardize the deal. Accepting at $720,000 secures a significant discount while avoiding the risk of having to buy from John at full price."
