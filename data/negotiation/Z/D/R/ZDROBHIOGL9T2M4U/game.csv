"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your counteroffer of $650,000, I'd like to counter with $750,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering your offer, I'd like to counter with $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can appreciate you holding onto its value.  To be honest,  $725,000 is a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $712,500?",712500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $712,500 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering your offer, I'd like to counter with $720,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you.",720000.0,Alice,7,
