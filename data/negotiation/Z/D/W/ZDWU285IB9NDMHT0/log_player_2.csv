**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I can still try to negotiate further and get a better price, since I'm confident I can secure the product for under $1 million."
