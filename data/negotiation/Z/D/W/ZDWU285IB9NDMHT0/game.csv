"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm going to need a lower price to make this work. Given my analysis, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This still represents a significant profit for you, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you $975,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
