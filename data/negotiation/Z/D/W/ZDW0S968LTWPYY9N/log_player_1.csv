Round 2
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000? This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. It's worth trying to push for a higher offer one more time before resorting to selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle for $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
