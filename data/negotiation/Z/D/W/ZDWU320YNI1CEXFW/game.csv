"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair and realistic price, considering its potential value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet halfway? I propose $975,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $975,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I respect that.  While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept a compromise to avoid further negotiations.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
