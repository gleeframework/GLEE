"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but still gives me a significant profit.  Let's see if he's willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,750. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it's still a good deal for him, and it's closer to the profit I'm aiming for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting quite close and we are already in round 4. There's no guarantee I can get a better price, and if I keep rejecting, I risk him walking away completely. It's best to take this offer and secure the sale."
