Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $15,000, so I'm hoping to strike a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is a decent price, I'm still not happy with it. I will counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise. I think I can still get a better deal than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $12,500. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to sell for closer to $13,000, it's clear that Bob is not willing to go higher.  Selling to Bob for $12,000 is a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000."
