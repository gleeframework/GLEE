{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. It's a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for you. It also demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it is still below your minimum threshold of $15,000. It is worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can reach a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's still a great price for you and a fair deal for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $12,750, which is right in the middle of our last offers. This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $12,750 is closer to your minimum threshold, it's still not enough. It's getting late in the negotiation, and further back and forth with Bob may not lead to a satisfactory result.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees your desired profit and avoids any further risk of getting a lower price."
