"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's still a great price for you and a fair deal for me. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $12,750, which is right in the middle of our last offers. This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,4,
