"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your price is a little high for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a significant discount.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
