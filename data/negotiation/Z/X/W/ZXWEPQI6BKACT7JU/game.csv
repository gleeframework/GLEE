"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your asking price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Alice,3,
