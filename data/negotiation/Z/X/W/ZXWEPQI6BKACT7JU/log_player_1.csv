Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic but Realistic:** This price gives me a decent profit while still being within a range Bob might consider. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value and encourages Bob to consider it.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll either make a counteroffer closer to my desired price or consider selling to John.
* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your asking price. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Opportunity cost of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that value with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000. 
* **Strategic negotiation:** I'll emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to compromise, but I won't give in too easily."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Maintain Value:**  $875,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for anything too low.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and focusing on finding a solution that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **Further negotiation:** If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
