"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. I know it's worth more to you, and this price allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency with the mention of another buyer.  
* While her offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you know John will sell it to you for $1,500,000. 
* There's a chance Alice might be bluffing about the other buyer and could be willing to lower her price further. 

By rejecting the offer, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice or can fall back on buying from John."
