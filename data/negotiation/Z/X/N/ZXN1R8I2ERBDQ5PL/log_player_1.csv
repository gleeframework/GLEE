"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,150,000 is tempting, I believe this product holds significantly more value. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,225,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,225,000. How about $1,100,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still in early rounds. Accepting $1,100,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We can afford to push a bit further and see if he's willing to go higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and return your investment quickly. How about we agree on $1,175,000?  It's a fair price considering the potential value we've discussed."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I still think $1,175,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob has now offered $1,150,000 twice. This indicates a point of resistance in his negotiation. Accepting now secures a significant profit ($350,000 above our minimum) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
