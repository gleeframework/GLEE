Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and you can still come down slightly while remaining above your minimum.
* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120), but the message frames it as a ""deal,"" potentially enticing him to negotiate. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome with Bob while ensuring you don't lose out on a profitable sale to John."
