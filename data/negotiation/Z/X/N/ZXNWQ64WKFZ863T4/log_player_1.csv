"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than Bob's valuation but not overly aggressive. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me.  While I could sell to John for $100, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is still a fair price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $98 is almost my minimum, I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer one more time before seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell to John. While I would prefer to get $102 from Bob, we've been at an impasse for a while now. It's time to move on and secure a deal."
