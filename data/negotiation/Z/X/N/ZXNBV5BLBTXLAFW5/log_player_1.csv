Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's Alice's offer, carefully calculated:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Here's the reasoning behind this offer:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but she also needs to offer Bob a price enticing enough to accept.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, Alice needs to price it above that to make a profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for her minimum acceptable price.

**Why this strategy is effective:**

This approach balances profit maximization with a realistic understanding of Bob's perspective, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale."
