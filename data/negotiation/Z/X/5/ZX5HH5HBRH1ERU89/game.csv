"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10500. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $10250 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is the last price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.
