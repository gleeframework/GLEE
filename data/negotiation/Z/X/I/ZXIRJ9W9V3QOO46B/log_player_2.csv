"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still possible to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, leading to Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a purchase within Bob's budget and avoids the potential for a less favorable outcome."
