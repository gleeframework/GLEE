"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7500. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7400. It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,400 is close to Bob's counteroffer of $7,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to compromise, and the price could rise closer to the $8,000 he'd pay John. Accepting the offer at $7,400 is a good compromise and saves Bob $600 compared to buying from John."
