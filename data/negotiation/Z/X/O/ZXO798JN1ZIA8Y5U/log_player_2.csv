Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,800, which would be $9,950. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very attached to a price above $9,800.  While getting it for $8,000 from John would be ideal, Alice's latest offer of $9,950 is a reasonable compromise and a good price overall.  It's time to accept and avoid the risk of her increasing her price again."
