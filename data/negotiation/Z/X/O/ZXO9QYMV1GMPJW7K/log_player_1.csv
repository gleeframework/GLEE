Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a significant amount, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer is within his range of what he'd potentially be willing to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for some back-and-forth during the negotiation process, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a backup offer from John at $1,200,000, I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's shown interest by making a counteroffer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial value of $1,000,000.
* **John as Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so rejecting Bob's offer doesn't put me at any risk. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise from my initial price of $1,150,000. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Midpoint:** It also sits at a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Still Profitable:** This price is still higher than what Bob initially valued the product at, and it's closer to my desired profit margin. 

I believe this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is getting increasingly close to his initial valuation of $1,000,000. It's clear he's not willing to budge much further.
* **Profit Margin:** This price is too low to make a reasonable profit, given my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, which significantly exceeds the potential profit from continuing the negotiation with Bob.

While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and losing the opportunity to sell to John outweighs the potential gain from a small increase in price. It's time to move on to a more profitable deal."
