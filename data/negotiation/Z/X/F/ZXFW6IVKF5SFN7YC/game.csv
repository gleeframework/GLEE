"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value you've highlighted, $950000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product, considering my maximum budget and the value I see in it.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique benefits it offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer of $800000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $825000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
