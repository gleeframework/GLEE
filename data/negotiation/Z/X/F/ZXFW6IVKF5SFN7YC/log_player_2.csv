Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The price is higher than his maximum budget, and there's no indication of how much Alice is willing to go down. It's best to try and negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique benefits it offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $800,000. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is unwilling to budge further, and her offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to secure the product from John at his price, which is within Bob's budget."
