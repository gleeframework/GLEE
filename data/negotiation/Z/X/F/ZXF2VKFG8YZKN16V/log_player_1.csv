Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and his perception of the product's value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $100, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product ($100). While you want to make a deal, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're showing a willingness to negotiate by moving significantly down from your initial offer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** The $120 counteroffer keeps you well above your $100 minimum and closer to a price that reflects the product's value to both of you.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By proposing a price in the middle ground, you encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially offer a counter-proposal closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer, his latest offer of $90 is still below your $100 minimum.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $100 you can get from John. It makes the most business sense to accept John's offer."
