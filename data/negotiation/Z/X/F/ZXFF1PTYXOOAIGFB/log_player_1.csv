Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob might agree exist between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer.  You can aim high with your initial offer. However,  pushing Bob too hard could make him walk away, leaving potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a limited-time offer as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **Strong Price:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying well above your minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) adds urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Stay firm on your minimum price, but consider small concessions to secure the deal.
* **Information is Power:** You have the advantage because Bob doesn't know your guaranteed sale price to John.
