"I'm interested in the product, but $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,250,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  I understand your perspective. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $2,025,000?  This reflects a significant reduction on my end and demonstrates my willingness to find a fair agreement.",2025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $2,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I've tried to be flexible to reach a deal.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction and a firm offer. I believe it represents a fair price given the product's value. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to proceed with other opportunities.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
