{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is fair for both parties. It's above my minimum threshold of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also highlights the potential value for Bob, incentivizing him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm willing to hold out for a higher price.  Bob has shown interest and acknowledged the value of the product, so there's potential for us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still represents a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price point. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $85? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to make more than $80, Bob's counteroffer is only slightly above what I can get from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation at this point, especially considering Bob's statement about being at his budget limit. I'll sell to John and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
