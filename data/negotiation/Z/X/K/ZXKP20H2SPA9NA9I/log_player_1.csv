I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still exceeding my minimum value of $10,000. 

I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is appealing enough for Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum value and a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
