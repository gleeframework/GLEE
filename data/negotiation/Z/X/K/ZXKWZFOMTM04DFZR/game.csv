"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds great value for your company and can significantly benefit your operations. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be valuable for my company, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $650,000 is lower than my initial asking price, I am willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your company.  I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this deal with you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a significant benefit from this product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell this product is important to you, and I want to make a deal. How about $825,000? That's a significant investment from me, but I'm willing to make it for the right product.",825000.0,Bob,6,
