{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage in a discussion. 
* **Asking for their Opinion:**  By asking ""What do you think?"" I'm encouraging Bob to share his thoughts and potentially make a counteroffer. This helps me understand his perspective and potentially find a middle ground.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Value:** I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product. This offer is a starting point to gauge his interest and get him to reveal his potential price range.
* **Market Research:**  If possible, I'd research similar products to get a better understanding of what the market value might be. This can help me set a realistic starting price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Depending on Bob's responses, I'll need to adjust my strategy. I might need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers or more willing to compromise depending on how much I want to sell the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and I'm not sure I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Since I'm not confident about getting a better price with further negotiation, it's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
