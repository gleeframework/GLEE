{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds, while still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to keep negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $8,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I can't go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. I could do $8,750. That's a fair price and would allow me to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
