"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my ideal outcome, but leaving some room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price, while still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures I can still make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $125 is still a good profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
