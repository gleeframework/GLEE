Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $12,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, but this is my final offer. If you're serious about buying, I'm ready to close the deal now.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit over my budget at $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14,000.  This is truly my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal now. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $14,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You've already made multiple counteroffers and it's clear that Alice is unlikely to budge further.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for $10,000 rather than risk losing out on the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
