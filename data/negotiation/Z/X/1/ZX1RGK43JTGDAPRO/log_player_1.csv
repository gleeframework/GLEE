Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase my product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will greatly benefit your operations. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. While I understand its worth to you, I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still higher than what I would get from John. It's important to keep the negotiation going to see if I can secure a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident I can achieve a higher price. It's only round 4, and I have more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore potentially better options."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1280000}
