It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially save a significant amount of money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to see if Alice is willing to come down considerably from her initial price. This puts the pressure on her and opens up room for negotiation."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still above my ideal target.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to my desired price. There are still rounds left, and I want to make sure I get the best possible deal."

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is a good price, it's still not the best possible deal. With 5 rounds remaining, I'm willing to risk rejecting Alice's offer again and see if I can squeeze out a bit more savings by counter-offering."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to Alice's desired price. I believe that this offer shows Alice that I am serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. It will be interesting to see if this offer will be accepted."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 3 rounds left, it's time to be pragmatic. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is very close to my desired price.  Accepting the offer now ensures I get the product without running the risk of further negotiation failure and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price."
