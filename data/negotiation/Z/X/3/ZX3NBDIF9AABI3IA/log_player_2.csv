"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $14,000.**  This is less than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $1,000** compared to buying from John. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save money."
