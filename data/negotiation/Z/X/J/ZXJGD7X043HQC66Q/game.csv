"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I can't go all the way down to $900,000, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $950,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $937,500.  This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to close this negotiation quickly.",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about $930,000?",930000.0,Bob,6,
