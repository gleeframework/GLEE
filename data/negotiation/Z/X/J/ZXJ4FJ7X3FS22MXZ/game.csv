"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $80 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement around this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $180. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I still feel that $80 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to my budget.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'll make one more compromise - I'll meet you at $160. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet at $160. I would like to propose $120 as a final offer. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value to me.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'll meet you at $180, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to consider it, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",180.0,Alice,7,
