"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $12000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to extend a revised offer at $9500 for the product. This price still reflects its true value while providing some flexibility within your budget. I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial considerations and we can reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",9000.0,Bob,4,
