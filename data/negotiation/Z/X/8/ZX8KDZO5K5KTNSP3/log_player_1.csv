Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me halfway?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While I could push for more, Bob landing at my minimum acceptable price means there's no need to risk further negotiation. Accepting ensures I get a good deal."
