This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also focuses on the value proposition and opens the door for a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $13,000? It's a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $11500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Bob's offer of $11,500 is above your minimum of $12,000.  It's a good deal, and you're likely not to get a better offer from him.  It's a good time to close the deal."
