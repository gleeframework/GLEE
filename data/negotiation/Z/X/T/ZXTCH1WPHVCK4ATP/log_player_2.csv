"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $950,000. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options before settling for the $1,000,000 price from John."
