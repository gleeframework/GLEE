"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to close the deal, I cannot accept such a low price, as it falls below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair offer and I'm happy to accept it. I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with nothing, especially since John is also willing to buy for the same price."
