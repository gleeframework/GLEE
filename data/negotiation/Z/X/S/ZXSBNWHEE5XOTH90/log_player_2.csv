Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $650,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm offering the product to you for $675,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $675,000, which is a significant improvement from her starting price. While I'd still prefer to pay closer to my initial counteroffer of $650,000,  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer gets me the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
