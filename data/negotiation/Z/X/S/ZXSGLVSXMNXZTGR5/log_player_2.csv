"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe it's only fair to present it at a price that reflects its true worth. My initial offer is $14,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There are more rounds, so Bob should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This offers a compromise between the original price and your proposed offer, while still reflecting the product's value. I hope this suggestion is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better offer than the previous round, it's still a bit above Bob's ideal price. He has more rounds to negotiate and should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget. Let's reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I've carefully considered your latest proposal and am willing to accept $12,800 as the price for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between respecting the product's value and accommodating your financial situation. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $12,800 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than the initial offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Bob has already rejected a couple of offers, and it's likely Alice is getting closer to her bottom line. 
* **Potential Risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will make a lower counteroffer. Additionally, there's a risk that they'll run out of rounds before reaching an agreement. 

By accepting this offer, Bob saves $200 compared to buying from John, and the negotiation process is complete."
