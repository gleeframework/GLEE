Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer. He's hoping that Alice, wanting to sell the product, will be willing to negotiate from this point. It's a good strategy to show Bob is serious about getting a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should continue negotiating, keeping in mind that he can always buy from John as a last resort. The goal is to try and get a price as close to his $10,500 counteroffer as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is once again raising his offer, showing that he's serious about closing the deal and that he's willing to compromise. However, he's still trying to keep the price as low as possible.  He's approaching his maximum, but with 4 rounds remaining, there's still room to try and get a slightly better deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, he still has a few rounds left and can try to push for a lower price.  He's already at a point where he's willing to pay more than the product is worth to him, but he's still aiming for a better deal. There's a good chance Alice is also willing to negotiate further, as the price gap between them is closing. He shouldn't give up yet and can try to meet in the middle with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a significant jump in his counteroffer, getting closer to Alice's offer. This demonstrates a strong commitment to closing the deal, and shows Alice that Bob is willing to meet her halfway.  With only two rounds remaining, the pressure is on to find a middle ground. This counteroffer also leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with a price lower than $13,500, which could then lead to a successful deal within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now higher than Bob's maximum price, and there's only one round left. There's not enough time to negotiate further, and accepting her offer would mean paying more than Bob is comfortable with. Buying from John, even though it's at Bob's maximum price, is the most sensible option in this scenario.  Bob is guaranteed to get the product and won't risk potentially losing the deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
