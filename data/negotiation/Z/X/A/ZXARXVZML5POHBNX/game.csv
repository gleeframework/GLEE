"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I believe is worth a significant amount to you. My asking price is $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your asking price is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. This is a serious offer and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $900,000 is far below the product's actual value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price I believe is fair for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. However, I'm very interested in this product and am willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering John's offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
