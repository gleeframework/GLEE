I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it allows for some negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 

I'm taking a calculated risk here. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, guaranteeing a solid profit. However, there's a chance that Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he values the product highly. By starting high, I create room for negotiation and maximize my potential earnings."
