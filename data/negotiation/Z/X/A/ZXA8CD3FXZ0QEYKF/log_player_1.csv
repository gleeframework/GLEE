Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its significant value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a great deal for you.
* **Strong but Fair:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price while maintaining a polite and professional tone.

**Why not ask for more?**

While Bob values the product at $15,000, there's a chance he might try to negotiate or find a similar item elsewhere.  Asking for slightly less increases the likelihood of a quick and successful sale."
