Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's a price that is significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,200,000) but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), which hopefully encourages him to consider the offer. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I hope to initiate a dialogue and create an opportunity for negotiation. This allows us to potentially find a price that is mutually agreeable. If Bob rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  

Remember, my goal is to maximize profit, but I also want to ensure that the negotiation process remains productive and doesn't unnecessarily delay the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. This also gives me the opportunity to send a counteroffer that reflects my desired price point and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

My previous offer of $1,150,000 was rejected, and Bob countered with $1,050,000. This indicates that he's willing to negotiate, but not drastically.  

Therefore, I'm adjusting my offer to $1,100,000. This counteroffer is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, hopefully incentivizing him to accept.  It is also significantly closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.  

This offer allows me to potentially secure a sale at a price closer to my desired value while still remaining open to further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation,  his offers are getting closer to the point where it's no longer worth my time and effort.  Furthermore, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000.  

Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept the offer from John and sell the product for $1,200,000. This ensures a quick and profitable sale without the risk of further negotiation with Bob that may not yield a favorable outcome."
