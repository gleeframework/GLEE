Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic, hoping to create a positive rapport with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also need to keep in mind that John is a backup option.  Since Bob values the product at $80, I'm hoping to find a price somewhere between our valuations.  Starting at $110 gives me some leverage in case Bob wants to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.** While I'd like to sell the product, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum value.
* **John is a guaranteed sale at $100, which is a better option than accepting Bob's offer.**  
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price that works for both of us.**  
 
**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $100. I'll try to be reasonable but also firm in my negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $95:**  This is a compromise, bridging the gap between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). 
* **Friendly and encouraging message:** I'm staying positive and reinforcing the value of the product for Bob.  

**Strategy:**

* **Finding middle ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's fair for both of us. $95 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my ideal.
* **Staying flexible:** I'm open to further negotiation if necessary. I'm confident that $95 is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.**  It's a significant improvement from his previous offer and is a good compromise.
* **Selling to John for $100 is a better outcome, but it's risky.**  There's no guarantee that John will actually buy the product, and I might end up with nothing. 
* **Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that's reasonable.**  It's a win-win situation for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This is a calculated risk. While I'd prefer $100, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because:

* **It's a fair price:**  $90 is a good compromise between our valuations.
* **It's a guaranteed sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit.
* **It minimizes risk:**  It's better to accept a good offer than to risk losing the sale to John or having to negotiate further."
