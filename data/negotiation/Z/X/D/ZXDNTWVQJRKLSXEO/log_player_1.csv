Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $2,300,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has immense value, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $1,500,000. Can we meet at this price?

Bob is unlikely to go higher than $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed offer for that amount from John. It makes the most sense to cut off negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
