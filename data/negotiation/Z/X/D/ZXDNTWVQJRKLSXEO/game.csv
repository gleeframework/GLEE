"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $2,300,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. This product holds immense value, and I believe a price closer to $2,100,000 is more reflective of its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product has immense value, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $1,500,000. Can we meet at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
