"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if that works for you!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This allows me to make a fair profit, and it's still a good price for you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,5,
