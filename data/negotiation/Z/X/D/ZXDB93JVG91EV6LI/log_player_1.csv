Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting close to the end of the rounds. If I continue negotiating, I risk losing time and the deal may fall apart entirely.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me a secure sale and a good return on the product."
