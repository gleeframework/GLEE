"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that aligns with your interests. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Alice values the product at $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation to get a price lower than $1,000,000.
* **John's Price:** Bob has a fallback option of buying from John for $1,200,000. This sets a ceiling on how much Bob is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process. He can counteroffer with a lower price, aiming for a deal closer to Alice's perceived value."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product is interesting, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable with the $900,000 offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. Here's why:

* **Alice is still above Bob's desired price:**  Bob is aiming to pay no more than $1,200,000. Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price range.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** While Alice has shown some flexibility, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to lower the price further. 
* **John's Price as a safety net:**  Bob still has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, which provides a fallback position. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price closer to his target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, it's still above his target of $1,200,000. Here's why rejecting makes sense:

* **Potential for further negotiation:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.  There's still room to bring the price down further.
* **John's price as a safety net:** Bob can still buy from John for $1,200,000, giving him a fallback option.  
* **Small price difference:**  The difference between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price is relatively small.  Further negotiation might be worth it to save a few thousand dollars.

By rejecting, Bob keeps the negotiation going and maintains the potential for a better deal."
