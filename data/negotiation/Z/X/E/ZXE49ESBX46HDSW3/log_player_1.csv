"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Being friendly:** A friendly message helps to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The price is not my absolute minimum, so I have room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I can still potentially get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can always sell to John for $120 if I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a great deal for both of us, so let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but still maintain a price point that is above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm highlighting that this is still a great deal for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Positive language:**  Using phrases like ""let's make it happen"" creates a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **More room for negotiation:** I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering again.
* **John is still a safe option:** If this round doesn't work out, I can sell to John for my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $80.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing efficiency:**  Highlighting that this price allows for a quick deal might make Bob more likely to accept. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly tone reinforces the idea of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
