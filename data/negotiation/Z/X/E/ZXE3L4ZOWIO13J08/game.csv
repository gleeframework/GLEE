"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's priced at $20000, reflecting its value and quality.  I'm open to discussing the price, but I'm confident it's a fair offer. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8000 for it. Would you consider reducing the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference at $14000? This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. This is the highest I can offer given my financial constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This would be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to proceed with the sale. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I am willing to pay $11000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions.",11000.0,Bob,6,
