Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement. I am willing to pay $1300000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a significant amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and the potential to earn more money.  Selling to John now would leave significant value on the table."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000? This would still give you a considerable profit margin while allowing me to achieve a more favorable outcome."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and I think we can find common ground. I'm willing to pay $1325000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $1,325,000 is still below my target. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $1,340,000?  This would be a good compromise, allowing us both to achieve a favorable outcome."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  Although Bob has increased his offer, I have 4 rounds left and can still get a better deal with him.  Selling to John at this point would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,335,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our positions and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1335000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $1332500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,332,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,332,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm nearing the end of the negotiation process.  Bob's offer of $1,332,500 is a significant improvement over the last few rounds and is very close to my target.  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of getting a lower offer or needing to sell to John for $1,000,000 is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a profitable outcome."
