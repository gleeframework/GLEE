"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1350000",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already met you halfway multiple times, and I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to make sure it's a good one. My final offer is $1380000, and I'm not budging from this price. It's the highest I'm willing to go.",1380000.0,Alice,9,
