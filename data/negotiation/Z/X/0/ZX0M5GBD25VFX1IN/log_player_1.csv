Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  While I value the product at $1,200,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000. Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves a potential profit margin for Bob, making it more enticing for him to accept.
* **Alternative Option:** It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $1,200,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While I want to maximize profit, accepting a loss isn't a good strategy. I know I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John. I'll counter-offer in the hopes of finding a price point that works for both me and Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position,  $1,100,000 is significantly lower than I can consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $1,250,000, I'm offering a compromise that is exactly halfway between his initial offer and my original asking price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to my target.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps the price above my absolute minimum ($1,200,000), ensuring I still make a profit if Bob accepts.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I haven't revealed my minimum price to Bob, keeping my position stronger."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to do $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While he's inching closer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point where I'd make a significantly larger profit than selling to John.  

* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Time Savings:** Further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming with no guarantee of a significantly better outcome.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Negotiations tie up the product and prevent me from pursuing other opportunities.

It's in my best interest to take the guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
