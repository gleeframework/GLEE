,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500, but I think I can do better than that. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit below my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think I can do better than that. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
