Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. I believe it's a good price considering its value, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is a significant drop from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While getting a higher price would be ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting the $16,500 offer secures a profit above John's standing offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
