Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $14,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $14,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit far from that number. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a price I might accept, it's slow progress and I have a guaranteed offer for $10,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
