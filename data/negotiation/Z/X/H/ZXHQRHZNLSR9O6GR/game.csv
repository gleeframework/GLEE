"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we meet in the middle? ",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That being said, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you consider $750,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
