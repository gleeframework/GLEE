Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $150. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $100, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $150 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively to make the product seem desirable and encourage Bob to buy. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on the context (e.g., if I know Bob is price-sensitive), I might adjust my approach."
