Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. Can you consider that?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While getting closer to Bob's valuation, $17,500 is still significantly less than our minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. We are willing to negotiate but need to push for a price closer to $19,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I still think I can do better. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,000. Can you consider that?

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob seems stuck on the lower end of the price range and is unlikely to meet our minimum of $18,750.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  Continuing with Bob has a decreasing chance of success and risks missing out on John's offer."
