{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, hoping to get a good deal. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price that is closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more. How about $85? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to keep my spending within $80. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same price I can get from John.  There's no need to continue negotiating, so I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
