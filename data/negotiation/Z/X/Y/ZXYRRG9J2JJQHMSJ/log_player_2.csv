"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still significantly higher than Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $750,000 is a substantial discount, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a strong starting point for a counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $850,000 is a fair deal considering Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum value of $800,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid further negotiation."
