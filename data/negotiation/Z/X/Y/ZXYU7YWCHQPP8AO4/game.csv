"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's start our negotiations here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures that we both get a fair deal.  Let's finalize this deal, as I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
