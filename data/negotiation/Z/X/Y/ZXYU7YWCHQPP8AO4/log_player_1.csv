"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price is also above Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This makes it more likely Bob will counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's start our negotiations here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will reject his offer and continue negotiations with Bob. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price range in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer but still kept it above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make my price seem more reasonable. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using language that encourages compromise and a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I want to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal. There's still a chance that Bob will increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures that we both get a fair deal.  Let's finalize this deal, as I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Stand:** I'm firming up my position by offering my absolute minimum price.  
* **Emphasize Win-Win:**  I'm highlighting the positive outcome for both of us if we agree on this price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Subtly implying that I'm running out of time by encouraging Bob to finalize the deal."
