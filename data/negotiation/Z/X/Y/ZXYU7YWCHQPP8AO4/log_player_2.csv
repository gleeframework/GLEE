"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's time to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's start our negotiations here."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is better, it's still too high. It's worth continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures that we both get a fair deal.  Let's finalize this deal, as I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and with only five rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiations. Buying from John guarantees a price within my budget."
