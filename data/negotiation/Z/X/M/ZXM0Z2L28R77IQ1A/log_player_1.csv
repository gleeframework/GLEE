Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation, but also gives you a good profit. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving you the chance to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also ensuring I make a profit closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my desired price point and represents a significant profit. While I could try to push for more, the risk of him rejecting the offer and potentially selling to someone else for a lower price is too high.  It's better to secure the deal and ensure a healthy profit."
