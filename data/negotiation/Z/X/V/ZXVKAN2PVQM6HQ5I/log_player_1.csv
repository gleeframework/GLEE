Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good strategy to present a friendly and encouraging message to Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  Bob clearly wants the product, so I'm going to counter his offer and see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,500. This price is still above my minimum and gives Bob a little room to negotiate. It also shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in too easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,500 is a better offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and only $800 below my minimum. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely and potentially needing to sell to John at $12,000. It's better to secure a sale at this point and move on."
