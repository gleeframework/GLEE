"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my earnings.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $11,500 price leaves room for negotiation, allowing for potential compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob if I continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control and leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** $11,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't sell for less than I'm comfortable with.
* **Positive and Persuasive:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer, emphasizing the value he'll receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit above my target. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10750. Let's try to reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $11,500, especially as I have a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Risk Management:** Selling to John is a secure option, but I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price just yet.  
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and potentially drive up the price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $10,750 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10,875?  This would be a fair compromise, and I think you'll be very satisfied with the product.  Let's try to close this out."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Gradual Adjustment:**  I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our last two offers. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** $10,875 is still above my minimum but also below my desired price of $11,500.  This gives me some wiggle room.
* **Urgency and Finality:** I'm suggesting a ""final compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer, as the deal is getting closer to closing.
* **Reiterate Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to remind Bob that he's getting a good deal, even at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm really close to my limit, but I can go up to $10800. This is a fair price considering the product, and I hope we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, which means there's little room for further negotiation and potential for higher earnings. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a stalemate, as we're both close to our limits. 
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer and meets my minimum requirement.
* **Time Constraint:** With only four rounds remaining, selling to John is a safer and more time-efficient choice to avoid potential delays and uncertainties."
