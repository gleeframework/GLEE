{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is above your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still a decent margin between your offer and Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, allowing for potential counteroffers and a final price closer to the middle ground. 
* **It signals your willingness to negotiate:**  By not starting at a very high price, you avoid appearing unreasonable and make it more likely Bob will engage in a back-and-forth."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,350,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher before settling."

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,375,000 is still a decent profit and above John's offer.  It's likely Bob won't budge much further, so I'll accept and move on."
