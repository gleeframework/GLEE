"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still  too high for my budget. I could potentially go up to $11,000 if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make one more significant move to close that gap. How about $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. That being said, $14,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
