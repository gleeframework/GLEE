"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to us, but given its importance to you, we believe it's a perfect match. We're offering it to you at a special price of $9,500. We understand this might be a substantial investment, but considering its worth to you, we believe it's a fair and reasonable offer. Should you have any questions or need more information, please don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your value:** You are willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice is offering it for $9,500.
* **John is your fallback option:** While not ideal, you can still get the product from John for $10,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or get the product for your maximum price from John."
