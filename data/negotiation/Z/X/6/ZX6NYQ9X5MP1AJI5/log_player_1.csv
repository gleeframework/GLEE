Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to find a price closer to my valuation. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'll counter with a price closer to $900,000 to see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer of $885,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a sale and avoid risking a further decrease in price or a potential deal with John for $800,000."
