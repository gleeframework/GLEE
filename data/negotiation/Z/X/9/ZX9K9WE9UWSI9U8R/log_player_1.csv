I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it still leaves room for Bob to potentially profit. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for profit:**  I believe Bob might be willing to pay more than $800,000, as it's unlikely he'd be interested in the product unless it held value for him.
* **Risk mitigation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000, so there's no downside risk. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  By starting with a higher price, I have room to negotiate down if needed. 

I hope Bob sees the value in the product and accepts my offer!"
