Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you subtly anchor Bob's perception to a higher price range.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's thoughts signals that you're open to discussing the price.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to secure the highest possible profit. If Bob accepts the $1,500,000, you've maximized your gain. If he negotiates, you have the buffer to lower the price while still staying above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
