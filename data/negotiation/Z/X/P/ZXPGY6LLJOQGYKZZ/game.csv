"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $10,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on the profit margin I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
