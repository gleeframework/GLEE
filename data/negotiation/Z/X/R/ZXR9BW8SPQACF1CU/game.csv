"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high at $9,500. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John.",8500.0,Bob,4,
