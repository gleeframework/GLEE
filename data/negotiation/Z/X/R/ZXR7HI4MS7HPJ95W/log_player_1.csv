{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** It's above the $800,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Lower than my minimum:** It's below my $1,500,000 minimum, ensuring I'm still making a profit.
* **Reasonable margin:** The $400,000 difference allows for potential counteroffers and a negotiation range. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price through a counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget and the value I see in the product.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Stay above my minimum:** It's still above my $1,500,000 minimum, ensuring I'm still profiting.
* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and compromise.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** The $150,000 difference allows for potential counteroffers and a negotiation range. 

This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to continue negotiating while still maintaining a profitable price for me."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm confident I can still get a higher price, and I'm not ready to give up yet."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. It's a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum requirements.  While Bob's offer is the closest he's come, it's still below my desired price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees the best possible outcome for me, so I'll choose to finalize the sale with him."
