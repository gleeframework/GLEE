I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening that reflects the value I place on the product. It also gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident that the product is worth this much to me, and I'm willing to walk away and sell it to John for $800,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $950,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on the value I believe the product holds. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my bottom line. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and I'm happy to secure a sale at $920,000."
