"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

This is a terrible offer from Alice!  Bob should reject it and proceed to counteroffer.  $18,000 is far above Bob's budget and significantly higher than the alternative of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should offer the minimum amount he is willing to pay, which is $10,000.  This is his ""walk-away"" price, as he can buy the product from John for that amount.  By offering the minimum, Bob maximizes his potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still offering a price higher than Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer than her initial offer, Bob should still reject it and try to negotiate further. It's likely that Alice is willing to go lower to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should counter with a price closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget. $12,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but leaving room for compromise. This gives Alice an incentive to consider the counteroffer and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob should continue to reject and negotiate, aiming to push Alice down to his maximum limit. This is still better than accepting the offer or buying from John at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly to show he is still engaged in the negotiation but not conceding too much.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This move puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,250 is close to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he's willing to pay. Bob should continue to reject and negotiate to push Alice down further. There's a chance Alice will lower the price even more to secure the deal, especially since she has already rejected several counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer again, but only slightly.  He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's not willing to go above his maximum budget.  This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is getting close to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to budge.  There's a chance Alice will lower her offer further to avoid losing the deal, as she has already rejected several counteroffers.  It's better to try to get a better price than accepting this offer or settling for John's $10,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly to $14,500. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is not willing to go above his maximum budget. It also gives Alice a reasonable price point to consider and potentially come down to. This move keeps the negotiation alive and puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal altogether."
