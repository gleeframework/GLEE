"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and ensures a win-win outcome for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
