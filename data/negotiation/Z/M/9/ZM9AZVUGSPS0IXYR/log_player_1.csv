Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below that is pointless.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
