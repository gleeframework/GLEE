"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value significantly exceeds $850,000.  I've already factored in a fair profit margin, and I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment for you. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This allows for a good profit margin for you while staying within my budget.  I hope we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I want to see this product in your capable hands. Let's settle this at $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
