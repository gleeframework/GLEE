"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is close, but I need to get a bit more out of this deal. Would you consider $1,300,000? It's a fair offer for such a valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I can do $1,275,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
