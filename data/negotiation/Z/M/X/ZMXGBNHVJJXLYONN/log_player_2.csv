"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something so valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($140) is within your budget ($150).**
* **It saves you money compared to buying from John ($150).** 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's a risk she might refuse, and you'd end up paying more by going with John."
