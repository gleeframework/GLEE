Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Testing the waters:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and gives you an idea of his perceived value of the product.  
* **Potential for significant profit:** If Bob accepts, you've secured a $400,000 profit over your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You can always come down in price, but you can't go up from your initial offer."
