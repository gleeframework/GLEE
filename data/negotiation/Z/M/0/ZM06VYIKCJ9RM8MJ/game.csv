"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $82 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and I pay $80?  Let's make this happen.",80.0,Bob,4,
