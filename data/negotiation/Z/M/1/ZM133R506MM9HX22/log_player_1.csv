Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I also want to be flexible in case Bob has a different idea of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$50 is far too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a good amount higher than my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is better than Bob's first offer, it's still too low for me.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John, rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
