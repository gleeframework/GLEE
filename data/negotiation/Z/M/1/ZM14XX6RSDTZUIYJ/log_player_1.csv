Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaves room for profit as it is below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives Bob some incentive to purchase, while ensuring you still earn a substantial amount.  If Bob rejects, you can confidently sell to John at your minimum price."
