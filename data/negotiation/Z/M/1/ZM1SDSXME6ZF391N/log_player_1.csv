Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $9,500 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving you some room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so you won't be losing money if he accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can negotiate down a bit without jeopardizing your minimum. 

By leaving a small buffer, you allow for a more natural negotiation process while ensuring you get a good price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I am not able to go above $9,000 for the product. I would like to stick with this price point as it aligns better with my budget. Let me know if there's any way we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob seems firm on his price, and I'm not comfortable going any lower.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  John is willing to pay my asking price, so it's best to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
