"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, would you consider $1,700,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, that price is still quite far from what I'd consider reasonable.  Would you be willing to settle closer to $1,000,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I need to be mindful of this product's value.  Let's try $1,400,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  To be honest, my absolute top limit is $1,000,000. If you can meet that price, I'm ready to agree today.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
