Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point as it is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, it's not worth sacrificing $100,000.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still a decent profit for me and it's closer to Bob's offer, which could encourage him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering less than my minimum acceptable price. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still not enough. I'll counteroffer again, and if that doesn't work, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  If Bob doesn't agree, I'll happily sell to John for the same amount."
