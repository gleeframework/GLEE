"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,800,000? I appreciate your consideration.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but $2,300,000 is already a competitive price for a product of this caliber.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,100,000 is a step in the right direction, my budget allows me to only consider offers up to $1,900,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
