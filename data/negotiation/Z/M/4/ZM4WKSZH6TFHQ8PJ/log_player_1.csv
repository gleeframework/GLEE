"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible. I'm starting with a high offer to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. I also have the option of selling to John for $15,000 at any time, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting it would be a significant loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll use this opportunity to send a counteroffer that's more reasonable but still closer to my desired price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I still have time to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $10,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my reasoning for rejecting his offer and highlighting the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a compromise and using language like ""meet in the middle"" to show flexibility.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.  By offering $10,000, I'm hoping to reach a deal in the next round or two.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider either lowering my price further or selling to John if the remaining rounds are limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $7,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. With four rounds remaining, I still have time to try and secure a price closer to my desired value. I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our current positions. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John as the rounds dwindle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is still a bit low. How about $9,000? I'm trying to be fair here, and this price reflects the true value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $9,000, which is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing fairness and the true value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's close this deal!"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

With only five rounds remaining, I'm aiming to reach a compromise closer to my desired price. By lowering my offer slightly, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round, as the time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're getting closer.  Would you consider $7,500? I'm trying to meet you halfway on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is an improvement, it's still a significant distance from my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

With only four rounds remaining, I'm going to continue negotiating.  I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our current positions. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John as the rounds dwindle and my risk of losing a significant amount of money increases."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $8,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  We're running out of time, so let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $8,500, which is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing fairness and the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Urgency:** I'm highlighting the limited time remaining to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm taking a more aggressive approach to try and reach a deal.  I'm raising my offer slightly but am still leaving room for potential negotiation in the next round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider selling to John as the risk of losing a significant amount of money increases."
