Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice is guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so she won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This is the absolute maximum he's willing to pay.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (Alice's minimum).

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and market potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why this approach makes sense:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  It's closer to Alice's desired price while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""market potential"" helps justify the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer doesn't start at Alice's absolute bottom line, allowing for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or he might walk away altogether. Alice needs to be prepared to walk away from the deal with Bob if he doesn't meet her minimum price."
