"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is $850,000, which is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. However, since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll try to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer Bob the product for $875,000.
