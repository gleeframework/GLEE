**Reasoning:**

While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $825,000 is quite strong. It's a significant amount, and continuing to push for a higher price might alienate Bob, leading him to walk away. Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal."
