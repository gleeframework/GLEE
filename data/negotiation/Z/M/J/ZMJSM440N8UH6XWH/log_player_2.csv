"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in.  I'm starting the price at $110, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer of $110 is too high. It is best to reject the offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80. It's best to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit more than I can spend right now.  Would you consider $90?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
