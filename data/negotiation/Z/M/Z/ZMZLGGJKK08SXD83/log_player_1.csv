"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, considering its unique features and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches John's, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price from Bob. Accepting Bob's offer now guarantees the same amount as John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing."
