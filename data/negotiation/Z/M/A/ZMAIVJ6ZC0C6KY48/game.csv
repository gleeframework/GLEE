"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
