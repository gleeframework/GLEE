"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal, you can still try to get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to pay $115. Would you consider $105?  I'm really interested in the product and hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $105 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $110 is still within your budget and a better price than John's offer of $120.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice will walk away or you'll waste time and potentially end up paying more than $110. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price you're comfortable with."
