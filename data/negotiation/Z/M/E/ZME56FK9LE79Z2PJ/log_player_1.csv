"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, while also showing him I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is a decent price, it's still below my ideal selling price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a further compromise, but it still leaves me with a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, we've been going back and forth for several rounds and I'm not convinced we'll reach a deal before the 10 rounds are up. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and with the limited time, it's the safer choice."
