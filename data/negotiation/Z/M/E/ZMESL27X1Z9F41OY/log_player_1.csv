Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $500,000 more than you do. Aiming for a price around $1,350,000 lets you capture a significant portion of that extra value. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you get well above your minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob. You are not desperate to sell at any cost."
