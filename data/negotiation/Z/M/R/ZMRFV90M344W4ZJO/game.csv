"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000.  Would that be feasible?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. Let's settle this.  How about $1,250,000?  It splits the difference and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
