"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows for room to negotiate and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Expressing Value:** Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and express his thoughts. 

**Important Note:** This is a high initial offer.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the potential for reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800000. Would you consider reducing the price to $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, there's still potential for a higher price. I'm confident in the product's value and want to see if I can get closer to my initial ask.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better price in the next round. 
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** By rejecting the offer, I can assess Bob's level of interest and commitment to purchasing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I believe the product's value is higher, I'm willing to compromise slightly. I'd be happy to accept $900,000 for it. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product while being fair to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Justification:**  The counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a higher price than Bob's initial offer. The message justifies the price by emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Middle Ground:**  The $900,000 offer is a middle ground, potentially appealing to Bob's desire for a lower price while still being significantly closer to my initial ask.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question encourages continued dialogue and allows Bob to express his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $850000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, leaving fewer rounds to negotiate. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing a potential sale and getting a lower price in subsequent rounds.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** Even if I reject this offer, there's a strong chance Bob won't increase his offer further.  I might end up with the same price or even lower in the next round. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a good price with minimal risk and allows me to move forward with the sale."
