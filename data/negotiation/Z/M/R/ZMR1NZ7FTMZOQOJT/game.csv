"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $9,500. What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle at $8,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000 at this point. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $10,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,250. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $8,750? That's a fair compromise, meeting you halfway between our last two offers.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $8,750 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,750 and $9,250, which is $9,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet at $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to come down just a little bit more. Would you consider $8,850?  That's a significant savings for me and still a good profit for you.",8850.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to the price I could get from John. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",9100.0,Alice,9,
