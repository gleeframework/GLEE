"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750.  How about we compromise at $9,250? This leaves a little room for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the price. Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
