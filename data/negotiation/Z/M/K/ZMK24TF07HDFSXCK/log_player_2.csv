"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering allows for a potential better deal."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $920,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $920,000 is an improvement from $950,000, there's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to his target.  He can try a counter-offer to see if Alice will go lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $920,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my maximum budget and still allows you a substantial profit."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can do $915,000, which is still a good deal for you, but also reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has already negotiated down the price significantly.  While he could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and he'd be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  $915,000 is a good compromise and secures the product for Bob at a price that's within his budget and significantly lower than the initial offer."
