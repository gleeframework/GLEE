Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice, that's a great price, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. Given the value I'm placing on the product, $750000 is the highest I can go right now. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's unique features and my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $825000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $800000?  I think that's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
