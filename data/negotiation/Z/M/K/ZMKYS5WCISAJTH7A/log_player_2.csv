# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

This is a good starting point.  $900,000 is a great price, but we can likely get it lower.  Let's try a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's unique features and my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $825000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice is still a bit too high.  Let's try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our goal."
