"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $700000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet at least $1000000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I must respectfully decline. My maximum budget remains $800000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
