"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $115. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly hope you'll consider it. Let's make this happen!",115.0,Alice,5,
