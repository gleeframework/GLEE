{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a good amount. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm adding a friendly message to make Bob feel like I'm willing to work with him.
* **Strategic:** This allows me to potentially get a better price than John's offer, but also leaves room to adjust if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's rejection shows he's willing to negotiate, his offer is too low to be acceptable at this stage. 
* **Counteroffer opportunity:** I can use this rejection to make a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price, hopefully securing a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $120, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also protects my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm using a friendly tone to keep the conversation positive and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic:** This price leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while still being significantly higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Close to John's offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's not yet worth risking losing John's guaranteed $150.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 

I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation with Bob to try to get closer to my desired price. However, if he doesn't budge further, I will accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $115. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly hope you'll consider it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm offering a final compromise at $115. This is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  I'm highlighting that this is a significant compromise on my end to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to try to close the deal.
* **Risk assessment:**  While I'm taking a risk by lowering my price further, I believe this is the best chance to get a better price than John's offer. If Bob rejects this, I will accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go as high as $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:**  $105 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **No further negotiation room:** Bob has made it clear that he won't go higher than $105.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is a much better deal than Bob's offer. 

While I'd like to get a better price, it's not worth risking losing John's offer."
