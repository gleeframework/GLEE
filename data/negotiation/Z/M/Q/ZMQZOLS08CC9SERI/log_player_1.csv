Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and increases the chance of a higher profit margin than selling to John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $14,000 offer provides a starting point for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, leading to a mutually agreeable price higher than $10,000.
* **Maintain Confidence:**  A strong initial offer demonstrates the value you place on the product.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. Bob could reject the offer outright, leading you to John's $10,000 offer. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
