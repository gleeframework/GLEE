"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John at $1,200,000 saves you $100,000 and ensures you stay within your budget."
