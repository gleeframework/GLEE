"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for this discussion. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000 would be reasonable.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly lower than its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $13,000? This feels like a price point where we both feel we're getting a reasonable deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting close!  I'd be willing to meet you at $11,000.  That's about as high as I can go.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're really close! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,000 even? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,7,
