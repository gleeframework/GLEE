Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you're willing to work with."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is better than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get a better deal.  There's a chance you can convince Alice to lower the price further, or you might be able to secure a deal with John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering your offer, I'm willing to come down another $500 and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. Although there's a chance you might be able to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will stand firm at this price.  It's a better option to secure the product from John for $8,000 to ensure you get the best possible deal."
