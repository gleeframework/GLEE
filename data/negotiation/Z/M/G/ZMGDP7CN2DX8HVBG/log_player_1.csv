Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit and this price allows for that.
* **It's within Bob's budget:**  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full potential value, giving Bob some leverage to negotiate.

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize your earnings:** You're aiming for a higher price than your minimum, but not so high that Bob will immediately reject it.
* **Maintain control:** You have a backup buyer in John, so you're not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives you leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than your desired price. You have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,500,000.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** You show Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Potentially get closer to your desired price:** By making a counteroffer, you might be able to secure a price closer to $1,750,000.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll need to carefully consider a counteroffer that is high enough to entice Bob, but still profitable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to negotiate, but not at a significant loss. It's a compromise that allows you to make a profit while potentially securing a deal with Bob.
* **Value-Based:**  You are still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.
* **Moderate Increase:** It's a reasonable increase from Bob's offer, making it more likely for him to consider it.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a deal:** The offer is attractive enough to potentially convince Bob to accept.
* **Maximize your earnings:** It is significantly closer to your desired price than Bob's initial offer.

You are still in a strong position, knowing that you can sell to John if the deal with Bob falls through. This allows you to maintain leverage and potentially get a better price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1475000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum threshold and is only $25,000 more than his initial offer.  

Here's why selling to John is the best option at this point:

* **Profit Guarantee:** You are guaranteed a profit of $1,500,000 by selling to John, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on, potentially lowering your final price or wasting your time.
* **Limited Upside:** Bob's offer is approaching your minimum price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John offers the best balance of profit and time efficiency. You're securing a fair price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate."
