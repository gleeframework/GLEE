Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a backup buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than $10,000. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest. If he flat out rejects it, you can always counter-offer closer to John's price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  You could also try:
* **A ""take it or leave it"" approach** with a price slightly above $10,000.
* **A more collaborative approach** by asking Bob for his budget and trying to find a mutually agreeable price."
