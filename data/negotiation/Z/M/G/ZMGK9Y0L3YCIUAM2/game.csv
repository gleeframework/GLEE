I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your latest offer and my previous one.

"Bob, I've been flexible, but I need to be frank.  I have another buyer ready at $1,000,000. To move forward with you, the price needs to be $1,250,000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer at $1,000,000, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a compromise. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,220,000. If this is not acceptable, I'll consider buying from John at $1,000,000.",1220000.0,Bob,8,
