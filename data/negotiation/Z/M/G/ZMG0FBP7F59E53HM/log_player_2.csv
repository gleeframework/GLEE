"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly below your maximum budget, you can do better.  Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of getting the product for a lower price, closer to its value to Alice. You can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000 if needed."
