"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but $70 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to sell it to you for $85.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? ",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $82.50 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $87.50? I think we can both be happy with that price.",87.5,Alice,5,
