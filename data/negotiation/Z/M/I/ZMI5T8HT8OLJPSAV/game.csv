"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price given the value you'll receive. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
