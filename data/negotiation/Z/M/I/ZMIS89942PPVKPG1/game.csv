"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
