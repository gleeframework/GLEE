"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me to agree to.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and call it $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, so I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I respect that.  I'm willing to come up slightly.  How does $1,025,000 sound?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I'm bringing to the table. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already met you at $1,050,000 and you're not budging. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to the value the product has to me. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
