"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  I believe this product will really benefit you and it's a fair price for the value it provides.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a significant discount from my original offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  I can't go as low as $9,500, but to show I'm serious about making this work, I'll accept $10,750. This is my final offer.",10750.0,Alice,7,
