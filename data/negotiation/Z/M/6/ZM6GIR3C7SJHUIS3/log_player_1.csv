Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It's also significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, so you have space to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was wondering if you could lower the price a bit? I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still hoping to find a way to meet in the middle. Would $90 be possible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also a good compromise considering Bob's budget.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $90."
