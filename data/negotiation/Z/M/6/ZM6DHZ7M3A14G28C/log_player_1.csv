Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. Here's why:

* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This means he's willing to pay up to that amount. 
* **My Minimum:** I need to earn at least $10,000 to make this worthwhile.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering $14,000, I'm aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $10,000, so this offer has no downside for me."
