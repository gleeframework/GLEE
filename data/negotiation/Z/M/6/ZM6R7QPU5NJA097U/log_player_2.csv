{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets a clear expectation that I'm willing to negotiate but won't pay the full asking price. This price is still within my budget, but leaves room for further negotiation."
