"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value the product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're getting closer to my minimum price, Bob! However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $12,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,6,
