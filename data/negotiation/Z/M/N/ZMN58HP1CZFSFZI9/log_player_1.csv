Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000. I'm confident it's a great deal for you, given its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,000,000? This still leaves a good margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $900,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get closer to $1,000,000. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
