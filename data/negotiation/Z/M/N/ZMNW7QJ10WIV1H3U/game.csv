"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is the best price I can offer for now.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Would you be open to $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This is the best I can do for now.",9500.0,Alice,5,
