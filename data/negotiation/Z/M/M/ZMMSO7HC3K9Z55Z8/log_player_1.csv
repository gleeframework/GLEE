Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate and still make a good profit. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not willing to settle for less. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000.  This is a compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, especially since he rejected my initial offer."
