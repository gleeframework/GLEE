"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product from John for $1,500,000, so Alice needs to come down in price for Bob to buy from her."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, don't you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's willing to sell it for $1,375,000, which is still below his maximum price of $1,500,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he should take it."
