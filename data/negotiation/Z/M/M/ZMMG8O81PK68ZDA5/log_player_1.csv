Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think!

You have three options:

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $175, considering your interest.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

$120 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter Bob's offer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $160 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm better off selling to John and getting a guaranteed $150."
