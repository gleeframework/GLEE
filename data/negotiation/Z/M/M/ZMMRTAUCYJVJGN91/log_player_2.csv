# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This price still provides a good return for me, but also reflects your value for it.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I'm not sure we're going to agree.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute floor.  This is a fair price for both of us. If you want this product, this is the final offer.  Think it over.
