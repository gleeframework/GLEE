"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair offer, considering the value you'll gain from owning it. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This price still provides a good return for me, but also reflects your value for it.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $950,000. This price should be more palatable for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I'm not sure we're going to agree.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute floor.  This is a fair price for both of us. If you want this product, this is the final offer.  Think it over.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up from my previous offer, but I think $975,000 is the highest I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
