Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $15000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This reflects the value to me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me. I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
