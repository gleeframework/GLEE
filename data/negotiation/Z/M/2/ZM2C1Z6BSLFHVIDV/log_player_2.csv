"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $9,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut the losses. Alice has made it clear she's not willing to meet your price. You're better off taking John's offer and securing the product at your target price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better outcome for you at this point."
