{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $11,500, which is only $500 away from my initial counteroffer and a significant discount from her initial offer. This is a good deal for me considering my maximum budget.  While I could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are minimal, and it's risky to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a decent price."
