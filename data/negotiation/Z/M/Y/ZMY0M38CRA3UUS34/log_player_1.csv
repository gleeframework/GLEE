"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by asking for the full value of the product to me.  This is my best-case scenario and it sets the tone for the negotiation.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly.  I also have John as a backup, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in further negotiations, especially since I have John as a guaranteed buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. It shows willingness to negotiate, but also maintains my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're now within a reasonable range of my desired price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  I've made significant progress in the negotiations, and continuing to push for a higher price might risk losing the deal entirely."
