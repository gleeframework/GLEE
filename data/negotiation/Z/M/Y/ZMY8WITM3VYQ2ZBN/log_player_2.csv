"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a valuable asset worth at least $1,200,000 to both of us, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The price is now the same as John's offer, and he doesn't need to keep negotiating.  It's a good deal for him, and he can get the product without further hassle."
