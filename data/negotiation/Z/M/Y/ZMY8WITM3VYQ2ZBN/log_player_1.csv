Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy the product from you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
