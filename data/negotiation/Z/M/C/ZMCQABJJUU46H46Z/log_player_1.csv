Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Anchor Price:** By offering a price of $120, you are setting a high anchor. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it makes a lower counter-offer from him more likely to be closer to your desired range.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob."
