"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to you. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85, which is still within my budget and closer to the product's worth to Alice.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still offering a significant discount from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping to get Alice to come down further.  I still have time before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $90. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal. It's a compromise that might be acceptable to her, especially since she's already rejected my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is getting closer to the point where I might consider buying from John, I'm still within my budget and have time for more negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm determined to get a lower price and come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $95. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise and  move closer to her last offer.  Since we're nearing the midpoint of our negotiations, it's time to make a serious offer that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, Alice's offer of $110 is too close to John's price of $120. The risk of further negotiation is not worth it.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
