"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can meet you in the middle, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15000, which is still a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500 for the product. That's the highest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I can sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $16000, which would be $14750. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $14750. I can meet you at $16000, but I'm not going any higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go above $14000. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and buy the product from John for $10000.",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $14000. I'm willing to make one last concession, though. I can sell the product to you for $16500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $15000. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm not willing to pay $16500. I'm willing to make a final offer of $13000 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away and buy the product from John for $10000. This is my last offer.",13000.0,Bob,10,
