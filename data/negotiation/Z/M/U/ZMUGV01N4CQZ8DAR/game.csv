"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this asset, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
