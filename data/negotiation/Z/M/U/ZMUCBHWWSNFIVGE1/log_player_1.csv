Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $100 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $80, so Alice needs to offer it for less than that to entice him.
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $100 to John, so there's no risk of getting stuck with the product. 

By offering the product at $95, Alice aims for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation but still attractive enough for him to consider, given the potential value it might hold for him. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything as she can sell it to John for her minimum desired price."
