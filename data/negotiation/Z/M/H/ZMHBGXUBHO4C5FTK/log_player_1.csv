"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation and expressing confidence in the product's value for Bob. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  The price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting the short end of the stick. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to encourage Bob to counteroffer and we can find a price that works for both of us. If Bob doesn't counteroffer or we can't find a price we both agree on within 10 rounds, I'll be prepared to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than his own perceived value of $8,000.  Accepting it would result in a huge loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still early in the negotiation process, and I believe there's more room to bargain. If Bob continues to undervalue the product, I'll be prepared to sell to John in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $9,000 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, suggesting he's getting a good deal even at $9,000.
* **Setting a Limit:**  $9,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum. It leaves room for further negotiation but also establishes a clear limit.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground that's closer to my minimum price while still being attractive enough for Bob. This approach increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds. If Bob continues to undervalue the product, I'm prepared to sell to John in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than his own perceived value of $8,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't compromise my minimum price just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my target. We're only in round 4, and there's still time to find a mutually agreeable price. If Bob remains unwilling to budge, I'm prepared to sell to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $6,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's try $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing firm on a price above my minimum, but it's also closer to Bob's perceived value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a limit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and how $8,500 is a fair reflection of that.
* **Direct Appeal:** I'm directly asking for his opinion, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to push Bob closer to my minimum price by offering a price that's closer to his own perceived value.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to compromise and avoid the need to sell to John.  However, if Bob continues to undervalue the product, I'm prepared to sell to John in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. $8,500 is close, but I have a firm budget for this purchase.  Would you be willing to meet me at $7,000? This would be a great price for me and help me close out this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my perceived value of $15,000 and his own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to compromise my minimum price just yet.  I'm prepared to counteroffer again, aiming for a price that's closer to my target.  We're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation rounds, and I believe we can still find a mutually agreeable price. If Bob remains unwilling to budge, I'll be ready to sell to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  The product is truly valuable, and I believe $8,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm sticking to a price above my minimum, demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's worth and how $8,000 represents a good deal for both parties.
* **Call for Compromise:** I'm using a softer approach, calling for a compromise and expressing confidence in the value.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my minimum while still being appealing to Bob.  I'm hoping to convince him that $8,000 is a reasonable price considering the value of the product.  If this offer is rejected, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
