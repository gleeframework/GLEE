"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $15000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd like to counteroffer at $22000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $22000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counteroffer at $17500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",17500.0,Bob,4,
