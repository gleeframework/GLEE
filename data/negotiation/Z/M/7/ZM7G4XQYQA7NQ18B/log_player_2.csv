"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price ($100).** You want to save money.
* **Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.** 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option, but you want to avoid that if possible.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget ($100).** 
* **This price is a good compromise,  and you're saving $2.50 compared to buying from John.**
* **Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.**"
