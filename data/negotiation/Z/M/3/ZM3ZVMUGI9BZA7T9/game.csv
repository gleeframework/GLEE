"Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming higher than $1,600,000, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,950,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to move while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,950,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,775,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1775000.0,Bob,4,
