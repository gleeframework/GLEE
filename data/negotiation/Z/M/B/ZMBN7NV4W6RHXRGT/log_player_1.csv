"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize profit.  I'm setting the price at $1,500,000, which is a significant margin above my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation and will give me a better understanding of Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not satisfied with that price.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round. There are still 8 rounds left, and there's a possibility that Bob might be willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise for Bob while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a bit better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is another compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise for Bob and we can finally come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,220,000 is getting closer to my initial offer, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm hoping that with only 4 rounds left, Bob will realize that he needs to offer more if he wants to buy the product.  I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a little bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm countering with $1,275,000. I'm narrowing the gap between my offer and Bob's last one, hoping to make a deal before we run out of rounds. With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer being significantly better than John's offer, it's a good time to secure the sale. While I'd prefer more, $1,225,000 is still a good deal, and it's likely we won't get a better offer in the next round."
