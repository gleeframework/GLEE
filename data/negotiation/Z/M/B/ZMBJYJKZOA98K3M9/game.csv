"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the value of the product and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
