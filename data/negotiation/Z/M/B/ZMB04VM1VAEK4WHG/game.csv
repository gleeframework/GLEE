"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider fair value. This product has the potential to generate substantial returns, and I'm confident in its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
