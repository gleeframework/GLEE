"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm confident this product is worth $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to pay that.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
