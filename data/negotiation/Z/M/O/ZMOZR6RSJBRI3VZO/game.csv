"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can work together to make a deal!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,200,000, which is still a good value for both of us. This is my final offer on this price point, so I hope we can agree on it.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
