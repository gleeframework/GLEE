"I can do better than that, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $105?",105.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to pay $98 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",98.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not quite ready to give up yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $109?",109.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100. I'm not willing to go any higher.",105.0,Bob,10,
