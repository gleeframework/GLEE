"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
