"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price and still a good value for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer since I can get the product from John for $8,000 which is lower than Alice's offer of $10,000.
