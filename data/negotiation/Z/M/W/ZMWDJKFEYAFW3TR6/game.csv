"Hi Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
