Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Plan B:** I have a backup plan of selling to John for $12,000, which gives me leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8500. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $8000, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $8,500 is still significantly less than my minimum target of $12,000.
* **Leverage John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale for $12,000, which gives me leverage to counter Bob's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Even though Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's still within a reasonable range, meaning there's room for a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $9,500, which is still above his perceived value but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Mutually beneficial:** I emphasize the importance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum. I can fall back on selling to John if this counteroffer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $9500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum target of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially get a higher price with another counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd have to sell to John for $12,000.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation might be time-consuming and lead to further delays. Accepting Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's within my acceptable range, minimizing the risk of losing a potential buyer and ensuring a faster transaction."
