"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities and market potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $750,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product which I'm confident will bring you significant returns. I could consider a price of $925,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true value.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique aspects, but I still think $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
