Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for Bob to bargain. It also positions you to potentially earn a very good amount.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our initial offer and also below our minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above our minimum and demonstrates flexibility. It also leaves room for further negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet us halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. It's now significantly lower than our minimum and leaves very little room for further negotiation.  It's not worth risking further time and effort with Bob.  John is a safe option, providing a price that meets our minimum and allows us to move on from this negotiation."
