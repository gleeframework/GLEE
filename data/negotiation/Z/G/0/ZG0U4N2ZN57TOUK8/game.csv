"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about $10,800? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $11,200 is still pushing it.  How about we settle on $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
