"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has a few more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance he can get a better deal. Additionally, buying from John would still save him money at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I hope you'll accept it."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,025,000, which is $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is the same price as John's offer. Bob has no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice since he can get the product at the same price from John.  Additionally,  since Bob has a limited number of rounds, it's wise to secure the product now to avoid risking the deal falling apart."
