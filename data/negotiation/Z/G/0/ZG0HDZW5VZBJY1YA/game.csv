"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price for my product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value of the product to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I hope you'll accept it.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,025,000, which is $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
