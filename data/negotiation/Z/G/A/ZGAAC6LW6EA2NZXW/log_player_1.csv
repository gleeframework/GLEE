Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  My message highlights the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting at $12,000, I can potentially drop the price to $10,000 or even $9,000 if needed, while still getting a good price.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm mindful of John's offer of $15,000 and won't drop below $10,000.

This strategy allows me to potentially get a good deal from Bob while keeping John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, considering John's offer of $15,000.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price. 
* **Using John as Leverage:**  The knowledge that I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 gives me a strong position in the negotiation. 

I'm confident that by rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer, I can leverage the situation to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to My Minimum:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Show Willingness to Compromise:**  By dropping my price from $12,000 to $10,000, I demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting the deal is finalizable to encourage Bob to accept.

This approach balances my desire to get a good price with the possibility of a quick sale to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Continued Negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price or prolonged negotiation, which is not worth the risk.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed sale at a significantly better price.

It's more advantageous to sell to John and secure a higher profit than to risk a lower price or a lengthy negotiation with Bob."
