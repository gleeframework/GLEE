"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $150. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than my minimum, I can do better. Bob is clearly interested, so I'll counter his offer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $110?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is firm on his offer of $100. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, I've already rejected his offer twice.  Continuing to counteroffer might risk losing him altogether.  $100 is still a good deal for me and ensures I make a profit. It's better to secure the sale than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
