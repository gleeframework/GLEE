"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. Can we meet in the middle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Can we discuss this further?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to ensure I'm getting the best possible price. How about we add a small premium of $50000 to get to $1300000? I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
