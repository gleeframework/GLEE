Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, for a price that is highly competitive.  Consider this a chance to acquire something valuable at a potentially advantageous price. Please let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing it as an opportunity,  without revealing my minimum acceptable price. This encourages negotiation and leaves room for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Product price:** I'm offering the product for the minimum amount I'm willing to accept.  This ensures I get my minimum value while still leaving room for negotiation.  

**Why this strategy?**

This approach allows for a potential negotiation that could lead to a higher price.  By not revealing my minimum price immediately, I can gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my initial offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, guaranteeing a positive outcome."
