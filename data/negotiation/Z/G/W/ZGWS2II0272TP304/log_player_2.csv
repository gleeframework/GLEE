"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation. It's highly likely you can get a better price, either from Alice or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling your budget limitations. 
* **Politeness is Key:** Maintaining a respectful and collaborative tone encourages Alice to continue the discussion. 
* **Anchoring Bias:** By throwing out a low number first, you might influence Alice to consider prices in a lower range than she initially anticipated."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $900,000. This is a great product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, $900,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down closer to the $800,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($900,000) and your previous counteroffer ($600,000). This shows you're willing to negotiate but also holding firm to getting a significant discount.
* **Pressure Point:**  By suggesting $750,000, you're getting very close to your walk-away point (John's $800,000 offer). This might encourage Alice to accept or make a final counteroffer very close to your limit.
* **Positive Tone:** Continue to maintain a respectful and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $825,000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $825,000. While you could try to negotiate further, it's risky. You're better off securing the product from John for $800,000. This saves you $25,000 and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
