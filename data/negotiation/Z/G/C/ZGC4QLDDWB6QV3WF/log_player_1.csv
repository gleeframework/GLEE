"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above $900,000.  I want to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to try to make this work.  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure that we both feel good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$950,000 is still below my minimum, but it's getting close. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll be more flexible in my pricing. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting closer to an agreement and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my desired value. I want to explore if there is more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $925,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $950,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's the final offer I'm willing to make.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're not willing to go below $950,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I want to be upfront with you - I'm also considering buying this product from another seller for $1,500,000. If we can meet at $925,000, I'd be willing to move forward with the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum, and he's now explicitly stating that he's considering a competitor with a higher price. This tells me that further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired value.  It's better to accept the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower price or a stalemate."
