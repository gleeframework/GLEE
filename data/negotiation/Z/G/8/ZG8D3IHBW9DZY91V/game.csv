"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my specified price range. I would like to propose an offer of $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1100000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also being within your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Given my financial situation, I am unable to go above $950000 for this product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'll make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
