Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Initial Offer:**  $1,000,000 is a significant discount from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John's offer of $1,200,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob makes a low counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.
* **Negotiation:** It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my target price through further negotiations with Bob.

I'll counter Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 is still too far from my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm value in mind.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping a positive tone maintains a friendly negotiation environment, even with a rejected offer.

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still protecting my profit margins."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both find this agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a profit, albeit smaller than I initially hoped for. It's better than continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal altogether.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision at this point."
