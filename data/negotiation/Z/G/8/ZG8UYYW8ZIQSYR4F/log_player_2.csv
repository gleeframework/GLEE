"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject her initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me and the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $900,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's clear that she's not willing to come down much further. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget.  Further negotiations with Alice are unlikely to lead to a better outcome."
