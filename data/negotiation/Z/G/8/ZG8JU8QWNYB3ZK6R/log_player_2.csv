You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  $900,000 is still above your target, but there's potential to get closer to it."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to signal my serious intent to negotiate.  $750,000 is a good starting point, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $850,000 is still too high. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my maximum budget. If Alice rejects, I'll go with John's offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is getting closer to my price, but I'm not willing to risk going another round. There's a chance she'll reject my next offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  Buying from John guarantees I get the product for my target price."
