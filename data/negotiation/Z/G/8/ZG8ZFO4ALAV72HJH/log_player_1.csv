Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Value Perception:** The message aims to frame the price as a ""deal,"" potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale. If Bob rejects the offer, you have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
