Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum ($80) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended to encourage negotiation. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I give myself room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will give me an idea of how much he values the product.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If Bob doesn't bite, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is above my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, I show I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Potentially get a better deal:** A counteroffer might lead to a price closer to my desired $80.
* **Have a fallback option:**  If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$85:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still being profitable.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and reiterate my interest in selling to him.  The message is positive and inviting.

This approach aims to:

* **Signal willingness to negotiate:** By counteroffering, I show Bob I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable price.
* **Test the waters:**  His response will reveal if he's willing to go higher than $70.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $85, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's still below my ideal price. Here's why I'm rejecting and counteroffering:

* **Close to John's offer:**  $75 is only $5 more than John's guaranteed offer. I want to see if I can push Bob just a little higher.
* **Maintain bargaining power:** Rejecting shows Bob I'm not desperate and might make him more willing to compromise.
* **Potential for a win-win:**  If I can get Bob to meet me at $80, it's a win for both of us.

By counteroffering again, I'm staying in the negotiation with the chance to get a better price without losing out on the guaranteed $80 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $80?  That's my absolute lowest, but I'm confident you'll find this product worth it."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$80:** This is my minimum, but it's also a fair price that's potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Message:**  I'm making it clear this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to make it more attractive.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** I'm pushing for my desired price while still being open to a deal.
* **Create a sense of finality:** This could encourage Bob to accept before he loses the opportunity.
* **Secure a decent sale:** If Bob rejects, I can confidently sell to John without losing out on much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking we could meet at the price John is offering it for. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** He's willing to pay my minimum price, which is a good deal for me. 
* **No room for further negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer would likely lead to him walking away, leaving me with John's offer of $80.
* **Avoid further delays:**  Accepting avoids the risk of further negotiations and potential delays.

It's important to remember that even though I initially wanted a higher price, accepting a good offer is a smart move. This secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to a better offer."
