You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering $90. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has lowered the price to $88.50, which is still within your budget and closer to your ideal price point. Accepting this offer would save you more money than buying from John and is a reasonable compromise."
