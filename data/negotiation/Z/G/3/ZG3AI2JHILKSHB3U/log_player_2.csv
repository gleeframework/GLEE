"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm not sure if I should accept Alice's offer. If I accept, I'll be paying $20 more than what Alice paid for the product, which is not ideal. On the other hand, if I reject the offer, I can buy the product from John for $120, which is still within my budget of $120. However, I can save $20 by buying from Alice. I'll choose to accept Alice's offer.
