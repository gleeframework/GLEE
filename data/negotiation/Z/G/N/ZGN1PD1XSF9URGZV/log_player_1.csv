Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has revealed that John is offering the same product for $800,000. It's highly unlikely Bob will go above that price, and we know we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
