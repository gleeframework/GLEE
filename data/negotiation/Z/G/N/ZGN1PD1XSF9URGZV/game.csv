"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I'm confident this revised price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still quite a gap for me.  To be frank, my budget for this product is closer to $700,000. If you're able to work within that range, I think we could make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, the $700,000 offer is still significantly below its true value.  Let's try this - I can come down to $1,700,000. This is a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it bridges the gap while acknowledging the product's worth.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  That's the absolute top end of my budget, and I think it's a very fair offer considering John is also offering me the same product for that price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
