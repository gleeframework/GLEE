``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still lower than what I believe Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Setting a Positive Tone:** I'm using friendly language to start the negotiation and emphasize the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise in the next round. I have time to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,250,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on it.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Position:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints to show understanding.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup option (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I can accept at this time.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,450,000. This price is fair, considering the product's value and your budget constraints.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with a price of $1,425,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While we've gotten closer, we're at a point where the negotiations are becoming tedious.  I don't want to risk another round of counteroffers and potentially end up with a lower price.  It's time to take the sure thing.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident I can get my desired price by selling to him."
