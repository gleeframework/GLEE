{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being positive and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still within my minimum price range. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John.  Negotiating with Bob has taken time and effort, and John's offer is a guaranteed $100.  It's worth taking the sure thing at this point."
