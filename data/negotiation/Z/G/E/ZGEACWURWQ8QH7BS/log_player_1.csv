Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers incredible value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Alice knows she can get $15,000 from John, so there's no pressure to accept a lower offer from Bob."
