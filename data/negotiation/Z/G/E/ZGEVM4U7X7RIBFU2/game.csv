"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $7,500, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,800. Let's meet in the middle.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement.  $7,800 is closer, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,100? It's a good price for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,600. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",7600.0,Bob,6,
