Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Approach:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to create a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without making me immediately want to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested. This allows me to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price.
* **Not wanting to settle:**  Selling to John for $15,000 would be the safest option, but I want to maximize my profits.  Negotiating with Bob gives me the chance to achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for us both to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Show Flexibility:** By lowering my price, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message reinforces the value of the product, reminding Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal. 
* **Open for Discussion:** I end with an open question to encourage Bob to counter again if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might walk away entirely, and I would only be able to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.  

Given the situation, accepting Bob's offer of $10,800 is the most pragmatic choice. It's a good price considering my minimum, and it minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
