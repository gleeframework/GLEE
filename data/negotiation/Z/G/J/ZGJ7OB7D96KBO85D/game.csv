"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still reflects the product's value, but I want to make sure we can both be happy with the deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $15,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",15500.0,Bob,4,
