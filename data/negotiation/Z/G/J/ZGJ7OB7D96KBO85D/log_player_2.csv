Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still reflects the product's value, but I want to make sure we can both be happy with the deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.
