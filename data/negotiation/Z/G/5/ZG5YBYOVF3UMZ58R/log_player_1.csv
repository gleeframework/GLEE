Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe is worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can leverage this to aim for a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial limitations or his willingness to pay more than $10,000.  You can adjust your offer based on any additional information you might have about Bob's purchasing behavior."
