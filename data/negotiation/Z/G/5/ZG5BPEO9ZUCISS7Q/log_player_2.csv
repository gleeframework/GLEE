"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  The value this product brings is truly unique. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than what I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go slightly higher than my initial counteroffer, but I want to see if I can push for a lower price. There are still rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly above my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,325,000, which represents a compromise and a good value for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I'm ready to close this deal and am willing to come down slightly to $1,337,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,337,500 is close to my target price and represents a good compromise. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price while still saving a significant amount compared to buying it from John.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is increasing, and the potential savings are becoming smaller."
