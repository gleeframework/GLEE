"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  The value this product brings is truly unique. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,325,000, which represents a compromise and a good value for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I'm ready to close this deal and am willing to come down slightly to $1,337,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
