"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it has incredible potential for you. My asking price is $2000000. I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1500000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a price of $1750000, which still offers you a good value and allows me to meet my needs. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000.  This would be a good compromise and allow us both to close this deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
