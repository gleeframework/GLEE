"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $12,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
