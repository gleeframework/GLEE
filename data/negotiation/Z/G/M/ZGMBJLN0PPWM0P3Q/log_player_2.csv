"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good price, Bob can potentially do better by counteroffering.  He has a clear idea of his upper limit ($15,000) and knows the product is worth less to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already saved $1,000 from his initial target and is now only $1,000 away from his absolute maximum.  There's a good chance he can't get a better deal, and it's worth locking in the savings he's already achieved."
