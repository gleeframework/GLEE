"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I think $9000 is a bit too low considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $10500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800, and I think that's a fair price considering its value. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $9800 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10250 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10500, so I'm offering it to you for $10250.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit far apart, Bob. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get at least $10000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10250, so I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is my final compromise.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to make a final compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9700, and I think that's the best I can do. Can you meet me at this price?",9700.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10000, so I'm offering it to you for $9900. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",9900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9500, and I think that's the best I can do. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,10,
