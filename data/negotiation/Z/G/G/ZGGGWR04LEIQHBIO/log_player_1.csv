Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100, let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $100 allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a lower offer, potentially around $90, which is still a profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice knows she has John as a backup buyer at $80, so she can afford to be a bit bolder with her initial offer to Bob."
