Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about $800,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're running on a tight deadline, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While I could try to push Alice a bit further, the difference at this point is relatively small. Accepting the $795,000 offer ensures I get the product at a significant discount from John's price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in the remaining rounds."
