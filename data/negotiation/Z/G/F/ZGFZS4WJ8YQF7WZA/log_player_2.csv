"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While you could get the product from John for $12,000, Alice is offering it for $10,000, saving you $2,000.
* **It's within your budget:** The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice's price is well below that. 

By accepting Alice's offer, you get a good deal and stay within your budget."
