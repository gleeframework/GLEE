Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($9,500) allows room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still securing a price significantly above your minimum ($8,000). 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the backup offer from John."
