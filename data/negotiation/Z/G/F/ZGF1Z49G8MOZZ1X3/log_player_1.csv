Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I've already spent a lot of time negotiating and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher offer from Bob.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option at this point."
