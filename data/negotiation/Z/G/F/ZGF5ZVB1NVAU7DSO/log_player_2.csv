"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $95 for you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is too high.  Since the product is only worth $100 to me, I'm better off trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice a price that's still above her value for the product ($80), but significantly lower than her initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $90 for the product. This is still slightly above your offer but below my initial asking price. Would you like to proceed with this counteroffer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still higher than I'm willing to pay.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still closer to John's price of $100 than my desired price point. I will try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reiterating my previous counteroffer of $85. This shows I'm firm in my price point, but still open to reaching an agreement. By emphasizing fairness, I hope to appeal to Alice's desire to sell the product without losing too much profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In light of your persistence, I am willing to accept $88 for the product. This is the lowest price I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope we can agree on this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is a good deal for me. It's lower than John's price of $100 and still gives Alice a profit above her value of $80.  Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product for a good price and avoids further negotiation."
