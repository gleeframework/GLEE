"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $105, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101.25? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,6,
