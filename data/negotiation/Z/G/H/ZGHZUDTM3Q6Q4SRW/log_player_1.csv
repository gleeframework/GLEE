{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum of $120, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It's below John's offer:** $115 is lower than what John is willing to pay, allowing you to potentially get a better deal with Bob. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might counteroffer, and you can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to accept. While it's tempting to take $90, it's not worth it for you. You're better off trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $105, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you are comfortable with. You're better off trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob. The potential profit of $2.50 from Bob's offer is not worth the risk of losing the higher offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101.25? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not worth the risk.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  John is guaranteed to pay $120, providing a much more secure and profitable sale. It's time to cut your losses and move on."
