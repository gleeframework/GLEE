"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that can greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Given the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that respects both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to both of us, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. $925,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Let's keep moving towards a mutually beneficial price. How about $890,000?  This is a fair offer that's more in line with the product's value to you and still represents a significant saving for me.  What do you think?",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $890,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering it to you for $915,000.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  we're getting closer, but $915,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $890,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to both of us, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen.",890000.0,Bob,8,
