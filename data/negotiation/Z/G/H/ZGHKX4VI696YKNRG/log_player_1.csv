Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than what it's worth to Bob. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $12,000, which is the value he places on it. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to him, and I'm hoping he'll accept the offer."
