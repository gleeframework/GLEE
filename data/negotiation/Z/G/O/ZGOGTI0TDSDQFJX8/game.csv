"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, what do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,500 is too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,250? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price for the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
