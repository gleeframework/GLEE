{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm using John as leverage. Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 sale allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  The price is high enough to potentially entice Bob, but also low enough to leave room for compromise if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, what do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Leverage with John:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay $15,000. This gives me a strong negotiating position.
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,500 is too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,250? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** By splitting the difference, I show willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a significant portion of my desired profit. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I remind Bob that even at $10,250, the product is still a good deal for him, highlighting its value.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I maintain my leverage and show that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is a Safe Bet:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, so I don't need to settle for a lower price just yet.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $10,250 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still holding onto a significant portion of my desired profit.
* **Appeal to Win-Win:** I highlight the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal, suggesting that this price is fair for both of us.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell."
