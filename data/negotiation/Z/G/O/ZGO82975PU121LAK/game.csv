"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth considering, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see we're getting close to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $990,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
