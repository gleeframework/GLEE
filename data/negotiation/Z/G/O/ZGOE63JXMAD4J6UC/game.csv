"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the exceptional value of this product and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's work towards a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product, while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's close this deal.  If this isn't acceptable, I may have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement.  However, $1,100,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
