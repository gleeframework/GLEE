"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start at $100. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a good sign, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

Reason: Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($80) allows room for negotiation.  Alice might counter, but even if she meets in the middle, it'll be a better deal than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. We appreciate your feedback. Considering our costs and the value you place on the product, how about we meet in the middle at $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is willing to negotiate, moving from $100 to $90.  It's still worth pushing a bit further to see if she'll come down even closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $80. Would you be willing to do $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

Reason: By counter-offering with $85, we're splitting the difference between our initial offer and her counter. This shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $87.50 as a compromise. This still allows us to cover our costs while being reasonable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice is clearly trying to find a middle ground. $87.50 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $12.50 off her initial offer and only $7.50 above our target price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
