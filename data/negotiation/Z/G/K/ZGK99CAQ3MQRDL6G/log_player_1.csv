Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $975,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still securing a profit of $175,000 over my minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the money to invest elsewhere rather than continuing negotiations.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I push too hard, Bob might walk away, leaving me to accept John's lower offer."
