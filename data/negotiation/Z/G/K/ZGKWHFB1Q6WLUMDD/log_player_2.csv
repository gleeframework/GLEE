"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and significance to both of us, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. This offer reflects not only the product's worth but also the unique opportunity it presents for you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject her offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  You have a fallback option of buying from John for $10,000, so there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the costs and benefits involved, I am unable to accept $9,500 for the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000. This still allows us to work within a range that considers the product's value to both parties. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I can try to lower the price further or consider buying from John if we can't reach an agreement."
