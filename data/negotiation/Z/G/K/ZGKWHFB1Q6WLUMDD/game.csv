"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and significance to both of us, I propose a price of $12,000 for it.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the costs and benefits involved, I am unable to accept $9,500 for the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000. This still allows us to work within a range that considers the product's value to both parties. I look forward to your consideration.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
