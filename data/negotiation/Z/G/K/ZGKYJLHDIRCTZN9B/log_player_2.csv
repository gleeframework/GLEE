Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your budget limit, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,025,000.  While she might come down another $5,000 or so, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees the best price for Bob."
