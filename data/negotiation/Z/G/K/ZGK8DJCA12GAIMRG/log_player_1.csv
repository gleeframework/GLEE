Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique features of the product, $1500000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1000000.  This is the maximum I can afford to pay, given its potential value to me. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
