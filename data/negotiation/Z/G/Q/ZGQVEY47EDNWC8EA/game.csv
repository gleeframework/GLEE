"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $950,000. I can do $980,000, which is a bit closer to my original price, but still a compromise. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
