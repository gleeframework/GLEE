"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
