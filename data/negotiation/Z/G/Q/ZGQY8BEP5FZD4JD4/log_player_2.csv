"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price but still well below your maximum.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but there's room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your concerns about the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer of $900,000 and closer to your counteroffer of $750,000.  This price is within your budget and leaves room for potential profit, making it a worthwhile purchase.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further outweighs the potential savings."
