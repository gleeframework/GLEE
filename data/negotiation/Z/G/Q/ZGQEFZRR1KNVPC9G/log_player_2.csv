"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's starting with a price slightly above that.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,200, which is closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product for a price that is still within his budget and saves him $800 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk of Alice rejecting future offers and potentially increasing her price again."
