"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $100 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,5,
