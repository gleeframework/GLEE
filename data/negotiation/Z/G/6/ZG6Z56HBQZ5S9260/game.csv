"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me is $12,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your business, $13,000 isn't quite enough for me at this time.  Let's split the difference - I'd be willing to accept $13,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250 for the product. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me. What do you think?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 still isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and accept $13,375 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it!",13375.0,Alice,5,
