"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,500 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better. He should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $9000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

$9,000 is a good price and is close to Bob's target price of $8,000. It is also better than the price from John, which is $12,000.  There is always the risk that Alice might come down lower, but given the risk of dealing with John or losing the deal altogether, Bob should accept this offer."
