Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe we can find a better balance. How about $9,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more. I'm not yet willing to sell to John, as I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I think $9,600 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that I'm willing to accept it. There's a good chance we could continue to haggle, but with limited rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether."
