"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I've already discounted. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down further. It's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000 than risk Alice sticking to her $1,050,000 price."
