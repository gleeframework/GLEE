Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150 is a reasonable starting point.** It's higher than your minimum value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and inviting.** It doesn't put Bob on the defensive and encourages him to engage.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a positive way, while still ensuring you get a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than your desired price.**  While $120 is better than selling to John, you can likely do better.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.** You have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially increase the price. 

This decision prioritizes getting the best possible price for your product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise.** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer.
* **Message is positive and encouraging.** It acknowledges Bob's offer and expresses a willingness to negotiate further.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal that's acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your desired price.** While you'd prefer $135, $125 is significantly higher than selling to John for $100.
* **Further negotiation might be unproductive.**  Bob seems firm at $125, and pushing further might risk losing the sale altogether.

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
