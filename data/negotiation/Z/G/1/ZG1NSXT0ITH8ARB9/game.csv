"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I need to get for the product. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000. That's the lowest I can go for now.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still a bit too far away from what I had in mind.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
