{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum selling price to John.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm still not keen on selling to John at this point, as I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still a bit far from that price.  Let's try $110 again. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
