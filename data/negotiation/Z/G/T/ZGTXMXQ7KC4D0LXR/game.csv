"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you and still above my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and is a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure $1,300,000 is the right number for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, as I mentioned earlier. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
