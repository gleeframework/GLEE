"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you and still above my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer because it is still $100,000 more than my target price of $1,500,000. I will make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still $200,000 more than my target price of $1,500,000 is not possible, but it is closer to my target than her initial offer. However, I'm not willing to pay more than $1,300,000, so I will reject her offer and make a new counteroffer.
