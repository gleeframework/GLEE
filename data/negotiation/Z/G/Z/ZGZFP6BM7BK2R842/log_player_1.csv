Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $15,000 and it's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still below your valuation and allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob is already offering a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  Accepting $13,250 is a solid outcome, especially considering John's offer."
