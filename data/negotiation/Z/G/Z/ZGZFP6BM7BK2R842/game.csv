"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $15,000 and it's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I have a budget to stick to.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still below your valuation and allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
