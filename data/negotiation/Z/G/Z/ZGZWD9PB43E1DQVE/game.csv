"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking of offering $75 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $82.50, which would be $78.50. Can you consider that?",78.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  Let's try $80 then.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll save us from going back and forth any more.",80.0,Alice,5,
