Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $8,400. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $8,200. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200.  At this point, it's more efficient to take the guaranteed $8,000 deal from John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
