"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Building rapport:** I'm using friendly language to create a positive tone and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's usefulness to potentially sway Bob. 

I'm aiming to get a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he is interested.  I believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is the backup:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at his current price. John offers a guaranteed $150, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is far too low for me.  I understand it's a significant price difference, but  how about we meet in the middle at $125? That would be a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing ""compromise"" and a ""good deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying firm:**  $125 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my desired range. I'm confident I can get at least this much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and is moving closer to my price point. This indicates there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a safety net:**  I can still sell to John for $150, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a little low for me. How about we meet at $115? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  I'm increasing my offer by only $15, showing that I'm getting closer to meeting Bob's price point.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using language like ""fair price"" and ""close the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying firm:**  $115 is still above my minimum but closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $115 is still a stretch for me. How about we settle on $105? That seems like a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $105 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John is a safe option:**  I can still sell to John for $150. This means I can afford to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.
* **Room for improvement:**  While $105 is closer to my desired outcome, there's still some room to push for a higher price.  

I believe with a few more rounds, I can either get Bob to accept a price closer to my minimum or safely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is a good compromise, and it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price right in the middle of our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using language like ""good compromise"", ""fair price"", and ""walk away happy"" to make the offer seem appealing and mutually beneficial.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the goal of making the deal happen, putting pressure on Bob to accept. 

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John to avoid taking a big loss."
