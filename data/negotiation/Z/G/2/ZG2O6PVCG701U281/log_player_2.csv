"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Target Price in Mind:** Remember, you're aiming to spend no more than $120.  This counteroffer leaves you space to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintain a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation to keep things amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $125 is getting closer to your $120 target.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're aiming for a slightly lower price. 
* **John as Backup:**  Keep in mind that John's offer of $120 is your safety net. If the negotiation with Alice doesn't go as well as you hope, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows Alice that you're willing to move closer to her price to make a deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $115 puts you right in the middle of her current offer ($125) and your ideal price ($110). 
* **Time Consideration:** We're now on round 4.  While you have time, it's good to make steady progress towards an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's try to find a solution. I'm willing to drop my price to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Target:** Alice's offer of $120 matches the price John is offering.  
* **No Need to Push Further:** There's no guarantee you can negotiate a lower price with Alice, and you risk her withdrawing the offer entirely. 
* **Securing the Deal:** By accepting now, you ensure you get the product at your target price."
