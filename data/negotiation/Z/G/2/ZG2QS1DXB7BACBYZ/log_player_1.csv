"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm asking for $950,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to establish a firm position and maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $50,000 gap allows for concessions in later rounds while staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's worth can subtly influence Bob's perception of its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below our minimum of $800,000 and far from his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting this low offer sends a clear signal that we're serious about the product's worth and not desperate to settle.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** We still have ample rounds to negotiate a price closer to our target. We'll counter in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To be fair to both of us, I could consider $875,000. This reflects a more accurate market value."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're acknowledging Bob's interest while firmly reiterating that his offer was too low. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $950,000 to $875,000, but this still keeps us comfortably above our minimum and aims for a strong profit.
* **Justifying the Price:**  Mentioning ""market value"" adds weight to the counteroffer and positions the product as a worthy investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That feels like a fairer price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer, while an improvement, is still significantly below our minimum of $800,000. His suggestion to ""meet in the middle"" indicates he may not be willing to go much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower final offer or a stalemate. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, which meets our minimum requirement.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations with an uncertain outcome could delay the sale. Accepting John's offer provides immediate certainty and allows us to move forward."
