"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but $100 is still a significant amount above your ideal price. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.** There's room to negotiate because Alice values the product at $80. You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You'll still get the product, but it's important to try and save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's price ($100) and your ideal price ($80).
* **Signaling willingness to negotiate:** It demonstrates your interest in buying the product while also showing you're not willing to accept her initial price. 
* **Staying within your budget:** $90 is still within your acceptable range, leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your ideal price:** $95 is only $5 away from your desired price of $90.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming less willing to sell, or potentially increasing her offer even further. 
* **Avoiding John's higher price:**  While you could potentially get a better deal, John's price of $120 is significantly higher, making Alice's offer a better option."
