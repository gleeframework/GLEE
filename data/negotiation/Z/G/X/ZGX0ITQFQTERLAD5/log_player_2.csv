Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as high as $95, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

At this point, further haggling is unlikely to result in a significantly better price. $105 is a reasonable compromise, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away entirely."
