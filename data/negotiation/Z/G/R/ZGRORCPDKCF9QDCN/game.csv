"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $13,000 represents a fair valuation of its worth, I understand your budget constraints.  Could we meet halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is still a little steeper than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but $10,500 is too low. How about we split the difference again and call it a deal at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working to find a price that works for both of us.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This would be a great price for me, and I'm sure you'd still be making a fair profit.",10750.0,Bob,6,
