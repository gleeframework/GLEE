Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price, as it's above my minimum value of $120 and below Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wishes, while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $120. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and ensures I make a profit."
