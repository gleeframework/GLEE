"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $82.50. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
