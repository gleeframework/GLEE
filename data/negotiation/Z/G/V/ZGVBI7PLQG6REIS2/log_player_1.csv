Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too low, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I have 9 more rounds, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I'll receive, and I'm confident it's a profitable deal for you as well. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is a good price, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating.  However, I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and ending up with John, who is only willing to pay $1,000,000.  It's better to secure a deal that's closer to my desired price than to risk losing out completely."
