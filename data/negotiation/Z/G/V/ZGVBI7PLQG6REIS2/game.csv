"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for you. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I'll receive, and I'm confident it's a profitable deal for you as well. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
