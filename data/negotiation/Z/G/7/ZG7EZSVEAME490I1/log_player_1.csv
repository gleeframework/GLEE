Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $9,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will be enough to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing him as a buyer entirely.  $9,200 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that it's worth accepting to secure the sale."
