Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is a gamble, but it has the potential to yield a significantly higher profit than selling to John. Here's the logic behind it:

* **Higher Profit:**  A $15,000 sale nets you $3,000 more than the guaranteed $12,000 from John. 
* **Unknown Value:**  You don't know what the product is worth to Bob, so there's a chance he'll value it even more than $15,000 and accept the offer.
* **Worst-Case Scenario:**  If Bob rejects, you still have the safety net of selling to John for $12,000.

This offer balances the potential for higher earnings with the risk of rejection."
