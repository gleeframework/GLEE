Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've chosen to start at $150, which is above my minimum value of $100. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better starting point.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the product's value, encouraging Bob to see it as worth the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This approach balances the need to get the best price with the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the [product name], but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum value of $100. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob is willing to pay, it's clear we need more negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is not optimal:** While selling to John guarantees $100, there's still a chance of getting a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of a higher sale price while also demonstrating my firm stance on the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120 to make this deal work. Let's find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Concerns:**  The message starts by acknowledging Bob's budget limitations, showing empathy and building rapport.
* **Counteroffer:**  I've counteroffered at $120, which is still above my minimum value of $100, but closer to Bob's initial offer.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a fair price that works for both of us, further encouraging negotiation.

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still holding firm on the product's value, aiming to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I'm still only able to offer $90. This is the highest I can go right now. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $90 is still below my minimum value of $100. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, his last offer shows he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Since Bob's offer is below my minimum, selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiations.

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, this scenario presents a better opportunity for a guaranteed return compared to continuing to negotiate with Bob."
