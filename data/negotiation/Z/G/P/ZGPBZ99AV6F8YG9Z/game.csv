"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'd appreciate it if you could consider my offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value this product brings to the table warrants a figure closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm optimistic we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that the price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'd appreciate it if you could consider my new offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find a middle ground.  I've tried to be flexible, but I also have to be mindful of the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to stick to your original price, but I'm afraid $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Please let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
