"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to Bob, and I'm still earning a decent profit.  It also leaves room for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get a deal done before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my target and I'm concerned that if I reject it, we might get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers. It's better to secure a deal now and make a good profit."
