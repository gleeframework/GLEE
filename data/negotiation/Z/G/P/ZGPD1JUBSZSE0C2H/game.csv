"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm a bit hesitant to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider $105?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about $98? I think that's a fair price for the product.",98.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,105.0
"I'm glad you like the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go to $98 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $102.50? That's the best I can do for now.",102.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit away. How about $97.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",97.5,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $105. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $104? That's the lowest I can go.",104.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm still a bit away from that price. How about $101? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price for both of us.",101.0,Bob,8,,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob! However, I've already made a few concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. I'm starting to think we're at an impasse. I'm willing to hold firm at this price, but I'm open to discussing other options. Let's talk about it.",105.0,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your honesty about being at an impasse, Alice. However, I'm still not willing to go above $100. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. How about $100.50? I think that's the best we can do.",100.5,Bob,10,,
