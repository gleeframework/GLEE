"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $15,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she's willing to come down to a price closer to your range. If not, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John."
