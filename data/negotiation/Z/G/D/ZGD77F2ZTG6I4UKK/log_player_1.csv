Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly imply that the product is worth the higher price without directly stating Bob would be overpaying.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Indicating a willingness to discuss shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. This makes it more likely he'll counter-offer instead of outright rejecting your initial proposal.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit.  If your priority was a quick and guaranteed sale, offering a price closer to $15,000 would be more appropriate."
