"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $7,500. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $7,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $6,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,900. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $7,500. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",7500.0,Alice,7,
