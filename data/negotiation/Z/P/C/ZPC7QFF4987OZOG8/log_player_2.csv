"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and allows me a significant profit. Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is bluffing. She knows you have an alternative buyer, and selling it to you at $1,400,000 is more profitable than her ""$1,000,000 backup"".
* By rejecting the offer, you call her bluff and increase your chances of getting a better price.  While John is your safety net, you want to see if you can get the price lower with Alice."
