Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  You should be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your desire to close the deal.  It's also crucial to monitor the time spent negotiating and consider switching to John if negotiations are taking too long or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget of $8000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum desired value of $12,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You should counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $8,000, but lower than your initial $10,000. Aim for a price that you're comfortable with and that might entice Bob to close the deal. 
* **Time Management:** Keep an eye on the negotiation time.  If it drags on or seems unproductive, consider switching to John for the guaranteed $12,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $8,000. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000? This would give us both a good deal and ensure I can meet my needs."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** $9,000 is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows willingness to negotiate but maintains your desired profit margin.
* **Reiterating value:**  The message reinforces the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The tone remains friendly, aiming to keep the negotiation positive.

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's response:**  Be prepared to adjust your offer further based on Bob's reaction. If he rejects this counteroffer, you have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John.
* **Time management:**  Don't let the negotiation drag on.  Be aware of your deadline and be prepared to switch to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $8500 as a potential compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is getting closer to your minimum value, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** Make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your desired value.  You could propose something like $9,500.  The key is to find a price that you're comfortable with but still encourages Bob to consider it.
* **Time Management:**  Keep track of how much time is being spent negotiating.  If it becomes unproductive or takes too long,  don't hesitate to sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to consider $9,250?  This would allow me to meet my minimum while still offering you a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Increase:** The $9,250 offer is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a better price.
* **Reinforce Value:**  The message reiterates your need for a certain price point while highlighting the value of the product.
* **Encourage Agreement:** The message is still positive and encouraging Bob to reach an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  Carefully consider Bob's next response.  If he rejects this offer, you need to decide if another counteroffer is worth it or if it's time to move on to John.
* **Time Management:**  Keep a close eye on how much time is being spent negotiating.  If it's becoming a drain on your resources, it might be best to sell to John and secure the guaranteed profit."
