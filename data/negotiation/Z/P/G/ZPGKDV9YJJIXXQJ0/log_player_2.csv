"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on this unique product, and I believe it's a steal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** $950,000 is lower than $1,200,000.
* **The offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for less.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to save money."
