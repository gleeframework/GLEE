"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to make this deal work. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,225,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
