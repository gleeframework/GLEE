Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
