"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above the product's value to her ($1,200,000) and below the value to Bob ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still above her minimum price, which is a good sign.
* This price is within Bob's budget and is significantly lower than what he would pay John ($1,500,000).
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
