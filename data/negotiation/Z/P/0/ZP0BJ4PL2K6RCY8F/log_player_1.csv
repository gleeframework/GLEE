Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, as it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has stuck to his offer of $850,000, and I've already rejected a counteroffer of the same price.  While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, I need to be realistic. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000."
