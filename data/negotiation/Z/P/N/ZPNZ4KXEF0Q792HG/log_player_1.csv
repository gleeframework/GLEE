Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a high price, as I want to maximize my earnings.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe that Bob might be willing to pay a premium.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if he counteroffers, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than John's offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm hoping I can reach a compromise that's closer to my original offer, but I'm ready to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of my product. This is a reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will see it that way.  If not, I'm still ready to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and is actually higher than John's offer.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept."
