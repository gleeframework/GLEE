"I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
