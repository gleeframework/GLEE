"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a minimum of $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1500000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to at least get $1350000 for this product.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value and potential of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
