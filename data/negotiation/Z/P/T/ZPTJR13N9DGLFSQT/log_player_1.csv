"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also setting a high bar for what Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'll see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum value, and while it's a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, the negotiations are getting more and more demanding.  It's a better deal than selling to John and I don't want to risk further negotiation."
