Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,900,000) creates room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing its true worth to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and uses phrases like ""suggesting a price"" and ""What do you think?"" to imply a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still securing a deal before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
