"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's early in the negotiation.** There's no need to rush into a decision. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is a backup plan.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000,  considering the value I place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer while still being within your budget.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and professional tone, leaving the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $13,500 is less than your maximum price of $15,000.
* **It's a compromise:** Alice has lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,500, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of further negotiations:**  While you could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price. You risk prolonging the process and potentially losing out on the product if she walks away. 
* **John's offer remains a backup:** If you're not happy with the deal, you can still buy from John. 

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $1,500 compared to buying from John while still securing the product within your budget."
