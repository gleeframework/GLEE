"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130 but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. $125 would be a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal! ",125.0,Alice,5,
