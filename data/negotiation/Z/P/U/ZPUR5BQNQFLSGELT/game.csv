"Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you for $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering its potential for your company, and it gives you a slight advantage over my other offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Alice,1,
