"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it from you. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product has a high value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000.
