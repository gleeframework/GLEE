Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so that's the absolute ceiling.
* **Minimum Acceptable:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't go lower.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * He saves $150,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * You gain a substantial $350,000 profit over your guaranteed offer.

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing your potential profit."
