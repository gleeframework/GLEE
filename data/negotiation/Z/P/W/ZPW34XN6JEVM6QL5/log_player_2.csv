"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its true worth. I understand this is a considerable investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for you. Let me know your decision by [date/time]. If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
