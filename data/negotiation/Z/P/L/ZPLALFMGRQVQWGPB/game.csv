"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product, but my budget is around $10,000. Let's start with an offer of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still a little over budget.  Let's try $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a reasonable profit on this sale. Let's compromise at $14,500. This would give you a good deal and would allow me to sell at a price that's closer to what I need. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This price would give us both a reasonable deal.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,6,
