Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Since you know the product is worth $120 to Bob,  offering it at $115 gives him a good incentive to buy while still leaving you a profit.
* **Above John's Offer:**  The offer is significantly higher than John's $100 offer, ensuring that you're maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's room to negotiate between $105 and your initial offer of $115. 
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob don't go well, but it's worth trying to get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Even Split:**  Splitting the difference between his offer ($105) and your previous offer ($115) is a common negotiation tactic and appears fair. 
* **Profitable:**  $110 is still a good profit margin for you, keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price and John's offer."
