"Hi Alice,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is unfortunately below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle at $9500? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a fair price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8750.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position. While $8750 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8900.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",8900.0,Bob,6,
