"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the price, even if general, can make the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and enthusiastic tone encourages a good negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in this product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we potentially settle on something closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).  While his message indicates interest, his initial counter is a large drop. We need to counter in a way that signals we're willing to negotiate but not at such a steep discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Could we consider a figure around $875,000?  This allows for some movement while still acknowledging the value you're gaining."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Compromise:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show we're participating in the negotiation, but we don't immediately meet his price. Instead, we propose a significant but less drastic reduction from our initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We gently remind Bob of the product's value to justify our higher price point.
* **Middle Ground:** The $875,000 counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's low offer and our desired price while staying well above our minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""Could we consider..."" keeps the tone collaborative and open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $800,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While we could try to push for more, it's risky. Bob is clearly aware of the product's value but is also demonstrating budget limitations.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
