"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
