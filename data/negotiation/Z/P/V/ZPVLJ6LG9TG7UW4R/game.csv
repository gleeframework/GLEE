"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your business, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product. This still represents a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still hoping to get closer to your original asking price, but I'm not willing to go above $13,000.
