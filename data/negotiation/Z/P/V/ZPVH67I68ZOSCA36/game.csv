"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize that your offer is a significant investment, the value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
