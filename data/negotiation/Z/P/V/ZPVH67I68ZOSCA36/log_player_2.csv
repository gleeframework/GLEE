"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,400,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for $1,000,000. It's in Bob's best interest to negotiate with Alice first to see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize that your offer is a significant investment, the value of this product is considerably higher.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  He can still get the product from John for a lower price, and therefore should continue negotiating with Alice."
