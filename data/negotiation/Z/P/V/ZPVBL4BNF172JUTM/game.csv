,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget for this purchase. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep, and I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to go to $900,000. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely moving in the right direction!  $925,000 is still a little higher than my ideal price, but I'm willing to meet you at $910,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $910,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $915,000. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.",915000.0,Alice,7,
