Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget for this purchase. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product.
