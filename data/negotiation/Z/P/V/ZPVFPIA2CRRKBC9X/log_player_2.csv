"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value.  While I can't disclose specifics, I assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's more than fair, considering its potential. Are you interested in learning more? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product is worth more to her, you don't know her true valuation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to purchase from John for a significantly lower price."
