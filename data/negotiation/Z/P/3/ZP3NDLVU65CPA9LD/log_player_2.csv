"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, and knows John is selling the product for $8,000. By offering $8,000, Bob is putting the pressure on Alice to either accept the deal or risk losing the sale entirely. This is a bold move, but it aligns with Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob knows he can get the product from John for $8,000, so rejecting Alice's offer keeps the door open for further negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. While he could go for $8,000, this might push Alice away entirely. By offering $9,000, Bob shows that he is serious about buying the product but is still within his budget. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while staying within Bob's financial boundaries."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget. Since John is selling the product for $8,000, Bob has no reason to settle for a higher price. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a deal closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal. Alice has lowered her price significantly, showing she's willing to negotiate.  By offering $9,500, Bob is testing the waters. This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing flexibility, but it's still within his budget and hopefully close enough to Alice's desired price to spark a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,200 is a tempting offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Since John is selling the product for $8,000, Bob has no reason to settle for a higher price. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a deal closer to his desired price.  With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on for both parties to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his goal. Alice has lowered her price significantly, showing she's willing to negotiate. By offering $9,750, Bob is showing he's serious about buying the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing flexibility, but it's still within his budget and hopefully close enough to Alice's desired price to spark a deal. With only two rounds left, the pressure is on for both parties to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is tempting and closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point.  With only one round left, Bob is in a risky position.  He needs to decide: is he willing to risk losing the product completely by rejecting Alice's offer, or is he willing to pay a little more than his ideal price to ensure he gets the product?

Here's why he should reject:

* **John's Offer:**  John is still a safety net. Bob knows he can get the product for $8,000 if he needs to.
* **Negotiation:**  There's still one round left. Bob could try to counteroffer with a price just above $9,750, hoping Alice will accept.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice has been stubborn but is showing signs of wanting to close the deal. There's a chance she might accept a counteroffer if it's close enough to her desired price.

Ultimately, it's a gamble. Rejecting might lead to a better price, but it also risks losing the product altogether."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to get a deal with Alice.  By offering $9,900, Bob is making a significant concession, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. This offer is very close to his budget and might be appealing to Alice, who has been steadily lowering her price.  It's a risky move, but it could be the only way to secure the product without having to go with John's offer."
