"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $11,000? That would work much better for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try this - $15,500.  This is my final offer as this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate that offer, but it's still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $12,000, and I think that's a very fair price.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
