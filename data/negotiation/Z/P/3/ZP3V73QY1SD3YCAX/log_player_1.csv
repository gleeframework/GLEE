Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $11,000? That would work much better for me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate that offer, but it's still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $12,000, and I think that's a very fair price.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated that $12,000 is his maximum price.  While this is closer to your minimum, you have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. It makes the most financial sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
