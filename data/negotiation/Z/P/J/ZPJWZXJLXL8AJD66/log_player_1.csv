Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I think this represents a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,200,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it at $1,400,000 gives Bob a potential savings of $100,000, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Leaving Negotiating Room:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at your minimum acceptable price."
