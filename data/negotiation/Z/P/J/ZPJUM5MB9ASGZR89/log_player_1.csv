Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher price point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're more likely to land above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the security of knowing John will buy the product for $80. This allows you to be more confident in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
