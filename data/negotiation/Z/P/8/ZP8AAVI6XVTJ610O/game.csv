"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've assessed its worth in the current market, and I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,150,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true value and provides a fair starting point for our discussion.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,050,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want a price that reflects the product's worth, but I still think $1,050,000 is a good starting point. However, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be fair, I'm also willing to adjust my position. Let's settle this at $1,090,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,090,000, which would be $1,082,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1082500.0,Bob,6,
