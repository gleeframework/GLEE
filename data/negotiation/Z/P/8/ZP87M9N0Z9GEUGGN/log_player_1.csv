Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob hesitates while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $10,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. Gauge his reactions to see if you need to adjust your strategy.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate.  You can always lower your price, but you can't raise it once an offer is made."
