"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for only $75. It's a great opportunity to get it at a discount! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above your maximum price point of $80. You want to see if you can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $75 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with $72 for the product. This still offers you a good deal while ensuring we cover our costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $72, which is within my budget. While I'd prefer to pay even less, it's not worth risking a further counteroffer and losing the deal. I'm happy to accept this offer and save $8 compared to buying from John."
