Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, but still ensures you're well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to go below $80. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing your potential profit."
