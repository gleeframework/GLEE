Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're willing to pay.

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice is willing to come down to $1,050,000, John is offering the product for a lower price of $1,000,000.  It's still within Bob's budget and saves him money compared to Alice's offer."
