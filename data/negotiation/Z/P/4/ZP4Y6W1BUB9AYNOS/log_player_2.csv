"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is within his budget, it's likely he can get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth, giving him the opportunity to work towards a price that is closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $130?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $130 is less than Bob's maximum of $150. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the difference between Alice's price and his target is relatively small. It's possible further negotiation won't yield a significant improvement. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Each round brings Bob closer to having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at a decent price without risking having to pay more later."
