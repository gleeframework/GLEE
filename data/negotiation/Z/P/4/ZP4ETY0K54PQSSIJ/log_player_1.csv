Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price.  $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum, and I have 8 rounds left to reach a more favorable deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can reach a better price. I have 6 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll lower my price to $1,275,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement if we keep working together."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John. We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and I'm running out of time. While I would have liked to close a deal with Bob, getting $1,500,000 from John is a much better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob."
