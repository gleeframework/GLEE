"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you, Bob.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going over $900,000. Would that work for you?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your latest one. I believe this price reflects the product's value and my costs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $950,000 to get this deal done. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see that you're committed to making a deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this price reflects the product's value and my goals for the sale.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell we both want to close this out.  My best and final offer is $975,000. Let me know if that works for you.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,075,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
