Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,000,000 is above my budget.

Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your preferred limit. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still limited to a maximum of $850,000.  I understand you have a higher value for the product, but I believe this offer is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in purchasing the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make a new offer of $900,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value I have in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $900,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You've already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected them both.  It's likely further negotiation won't get you a better price.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John, as you'll save $100,000 compared to Alice's offer."
