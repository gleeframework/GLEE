"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still limited to a maximum of $850,000.  I understand you have a higher value for the product, but I believe this offer is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's try to close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still interested in purchasing the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make a new offer of $900,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value I have in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
