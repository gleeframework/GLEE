"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you consider $80 for the product?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $80, which is our minimum acceptable price.  Since we already have John willing to pay $80, continuing the negotiation with Bob has no upside and risks us not selling the product at all. It's best to take the guaranteed $80 from John."
