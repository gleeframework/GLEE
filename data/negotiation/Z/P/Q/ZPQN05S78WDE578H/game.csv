"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand we're close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm counteroffering at $1,220,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm confident we can work something out.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
