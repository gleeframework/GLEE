"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This allows for some room to negotiate down if needed, but it also reflects the fact that I believe the product is worth more than $8,000 to me. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up higher.  I have 9 rounds left, so I'm not under too much pressure to accept a low offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while staying above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $8,000.  Bob seems to be sticking to his lower range, so I'll continue to try and push him up closer to my desired price.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I still have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to hold out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $8,500. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I'm hoping that it signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting closer to my minimum price. This is a big concession on my part, but I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway. I have 5 rounds left, so I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Finally, Bob has come up to my minimum price of $8,000.  While I would love to get more, I've reached my limit and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept Bob's offer and move on."
