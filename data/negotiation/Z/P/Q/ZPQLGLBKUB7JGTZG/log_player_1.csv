"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **I have 10 rounds to close a deal, so I'm not desperate.** I can see if I can get closer to my target price. 
* **Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to try to make more.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stick to a price that reflects the value of this product. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.** I'm happy to sell at this price.
* **I've already rejected his offer of $7,500, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds.** There's a risk that he'll keep lowering his offer, or I might reject his offer and end up selling to John for the same price.
* **It's important to close the deal and avoid any further negotiation.** This is a good outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the sale."
