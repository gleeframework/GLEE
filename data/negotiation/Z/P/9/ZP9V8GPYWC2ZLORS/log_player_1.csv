Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I'm also aware of John's offer of $80, so I have a safety net if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still better than selling to John for $80. It's likely that Bob's counteroffer was his best price, so accepting it seems like the most logical choice to maximize my profit."
