"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $16,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a budget of around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I could offer it for $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle somewhere around $10,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go and still feel good about the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which she states is her final offer.  Even though you could potentially negotiate her down a little further, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $8,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $8,000.  It makes more sense to take the sure thing and buy from John, maximizing your savings."
