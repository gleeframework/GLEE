"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
