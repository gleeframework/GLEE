"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I agree this product has value but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its potential in my business.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
