"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item that is valued at $15,000 by you, and we believe this price reflects its true worth while leaving some room for negotiation. We look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($10,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $10,500. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still leaves a significant margin for negotiation and I believe it reflects the value of the item while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering $11,000.
* **John's price:** John is selling the product for $15,000.

Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price and is getting closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting this offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice could reject further counteroffers or increase the price.  The potential savings of $500 are not worth the risk of losing the deal."
