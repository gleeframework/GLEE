Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price of $95, which is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable value. I've been through a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we can't agree on a price. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100, which is my guaranteed minimum."
