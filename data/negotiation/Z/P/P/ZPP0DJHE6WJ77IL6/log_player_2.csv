Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $82 is close to your budget, it's still above your maximum price point of $80.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $82 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $78.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $85. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price point of $80.  With only 5 rounds left, the negotiation is getting more difficult. It's more likely that further negotiation will lead to a higher price rather than a lower one.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum price, it's best to buy from John to ensure you get the product at your target price."
