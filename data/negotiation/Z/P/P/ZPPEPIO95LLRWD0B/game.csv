"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me halfway?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $90?,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $97.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that's the best price. Would you be willing to go down to $85?,85.0,Bob,6,
