"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for this unique product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
