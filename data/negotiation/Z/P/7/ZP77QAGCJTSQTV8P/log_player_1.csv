Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,900,000, reflecting its immense potential. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

Here's the rationale behind this offer:

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your minimum), you can afford to start high.  
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This offer helps you assess how badly Bob wants the product. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it leaves room for negotiation. You can always come down to a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum while remaining attractive to Bob. 
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to make a quicker decision.

Remember, you hold the advantage in this negotiation as you have a fallback option with John."
