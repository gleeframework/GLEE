"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great price considering the value this product brings. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9,500.  This would be a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $9,500 is still a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident this price would make both of us happy, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,400. This would give us both a good deal.  We've been negotiating for a while now, and I think this is a fair compromise.  Let's seal the deal!",9400.0,Alice,7,
