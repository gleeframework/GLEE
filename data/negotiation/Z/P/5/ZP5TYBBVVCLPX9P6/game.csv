"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $9000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
