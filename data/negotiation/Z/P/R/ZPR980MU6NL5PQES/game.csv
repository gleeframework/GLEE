"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
