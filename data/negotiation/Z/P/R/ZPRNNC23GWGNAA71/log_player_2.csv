# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you, potentially reaching $1,500,000. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant advantage for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.
