Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105. Accepting this offer gets you the product for a price well below your maximum and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
