"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $100 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
