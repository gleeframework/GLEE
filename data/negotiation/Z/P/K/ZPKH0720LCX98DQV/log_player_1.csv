Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than you value it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's close to Bob's value:** This increases the likelihood of a deal and ensures you get a good price. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response, but this initial offer is a solid place to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  You've stated your product is worth no less than $12,000 to you, and Bob's offer is $500 less. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While you can sell to John for $12,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  He's clearly interested and willing to pay more than your minimum.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob.  A good starting point would be a price slightly lower than your initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, such as $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a great deal,  $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident this price will still be a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $13,500. This indicates he is serious about purchasing the product and is willing to meet you halfway.
* **Above your minimum:**  $13,000 is significantly above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance he might walk away, and you'd be forced to sell to John at a lower price. 

While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the potential for a lost deal outweighs the small gain. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
