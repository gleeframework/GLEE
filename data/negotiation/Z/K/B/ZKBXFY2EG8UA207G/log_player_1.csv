"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while keeping the deal potentially attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is significantly below my minimum price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than his initial counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be a compromise he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you the product for $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product at Bob's perceived value. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's a good deal for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can close the deal."
