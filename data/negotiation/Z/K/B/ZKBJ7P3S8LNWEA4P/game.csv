"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $1,150,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,075,000. This reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to significantly reduce my ask to find common ground.  Would you consider $1,025,000?  This is a substantial concession on my part, demonstrating my commitment to making this deal work.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
