{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation space while still securing a profit above my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm confident that I can still make a good profit on the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold of $12,000.  It's also a fair compromise and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with another buyer if I reject this offer."
