"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is close to your limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is only worth $12,000 to her. By rejecting her initial offer and proposing a counteroffer, you can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price. It's a starting point that's beneficial to you while still leaving a significant margin for Alice to potentially accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to her minimum, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your initial counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might come down further, especially as she's eager to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I see where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her latest offer ($12,500) and your previous counteroffer ($10,000).  It shows you're willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a significant discount.  This price point is beneficial to you while still giving Alice a reasonable profit margin."
