{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, leaving room for negotiation while still being profitable for me. It also acknowledges the value Bob places on the product and frames it as a mutually beneficial transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, as I'm aiming to stay within a specific budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I value the product at. I'm going to try and counter-offer Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look at other options. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is within my acceptable range, considering that my minimum price is $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to sell to John for $1,200,000, I can still make a good profit by accepting Bob's offer. It's crucial to keep in mind that  further negotiation could lead to a deadlock, and I might end up losing John as a buyer."
