"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer you $1150000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to me, and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still slightly above my budget.  I'm ready to finalize the deal if you're willing to come down to $1225000.  This offer is still very fair to you, and allows me to acquire the product within my financial constraints.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
