Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000 is a starting point:** It's a high price, but not unreasonable, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **""Open to negotiation"" shows flexibility:** It indicates that I'm willing to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **""Great value to you"" is a subtle suggestion:** This is designed to pique Bob's interest and make him think about the potential benefits of the product.

This approach aims to start the negotiation by setting a high initial price, while also showing flexibility to find a mutually agreeable deal. Remember, the goal is to maximize profit, so I will closely monitor Bob's responses and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$800,000 is significantly below my minimum:** I'm determined to get at least $1,000,000 for the product, so Bob's offer is unacceptable.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While $800,000 is too low, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's willingness to engage indicates a potential deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. I need to find a price that is higher than $800,000 but lower than my initial offer, keeping in mind John's offer as my lower limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm serious about a deal. However, it's still above my minimum and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Focus on value and compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget while emphasizing the product's worth. This helps to justify the price and positions me as a reasonable negotiator. 
* **Open to further discussion:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can find common ground"" keeps the door open for more negotiation and encourages Bob to counter if necessary.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and reaching an agreement.  I'm confident that $1,200,000 is a fair price given the product's value, and I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $800,000, and I'm unwilling to go below $1,000,000.  Further negotiation seems unproductive.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I receive a significant amount for the product. 
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the higher the risk of losing John as a buyer. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit from John. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's the best move in this situation."
