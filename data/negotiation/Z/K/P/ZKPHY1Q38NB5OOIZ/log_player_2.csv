"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's beneficial to see if a better deal can be reached with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further. Buying from John is always a safe bet, but it's worth seeing if a slightly better deal can be reached with Alice."
