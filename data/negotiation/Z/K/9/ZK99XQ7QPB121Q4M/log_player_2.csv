"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to you. I would like to propose a price of $130 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $120 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between the value you see in it and my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise. It's better than buying from John for $150.  There's a chance Bob could get a lower price, but the risk of further negotiation might lead to a higher price or even losing the deal.  At this point, it's a good time to accept and close the deal."
