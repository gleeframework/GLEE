Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a price point that allows Bob to still perceive substantial value (saving $50,000 from his perceived worth) while giving me a potential $150,000 profit over my guaranteed sale.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers adds a level of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
