"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for your product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate."
