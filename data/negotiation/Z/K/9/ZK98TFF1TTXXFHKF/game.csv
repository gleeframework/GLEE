"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for your product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's meet in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,4,
