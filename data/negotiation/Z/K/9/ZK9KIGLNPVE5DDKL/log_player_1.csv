Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120.  It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob. This can make him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that implies I'm open to negotiation (""let me know what you think""). This keeps the door open for a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still being open to negotiation.  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm always prepared to sell to John for $80 if the negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering this product to me, Alice! I'm interested, but the price is a little steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $90 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $80. This represents a good profit for me.
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll come up to a price I'm happy with, or that the negotiations will even lead to a sale.  
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob now guarantees a quick sale and profit. Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's always the risk that the deal might fall apart.

**Strategy:**

While I would ideally like to get closer to $120, accepting Bob's offer secures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty and potential delays of further negotiation."
