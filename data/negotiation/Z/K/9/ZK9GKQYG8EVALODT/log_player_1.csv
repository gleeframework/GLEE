Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering to sell you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I think a price of $11,500 is fair for both of us, what do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,999 is tempting, starting with $11,500 leaves some room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John ($10,000), so there's less pressure to accept a low offer.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a price that's very good for Alice while still likely being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
