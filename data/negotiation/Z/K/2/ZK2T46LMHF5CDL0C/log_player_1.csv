"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm not setting an unrealistic price that would immediately lead to a rejection. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay within the 10 rounds. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I can gauge his interest and potentially get closer to my desired $1,200,000. If he's not willing to meet my price, I can always sell to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can push Bob further, especially since he's already shown interest in the product.
* **John's Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John, which gives me leverage in this negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, but I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my target before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Counteroffer:** I'm starting a new negotiation round with a counteroffer to Bob's initial offer.
* **Compromise & Value:** My offer is a compromise - higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer. I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing the offer as a starting point for further discussion, leaving the door open for Bob to potentially counter again.

**Strategy:**

By slightly lowering my offer, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still holding a firm position. This approach encourages Bob to consider the deal seriously and possibly come closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between the product's value and our respective interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my desired price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have the advantage of John's offer as a backup. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There's still room to push Bob towards a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob. I believe I can get him to come closer to my desired price.  Since I have the John option, I'm not in a rush to settle for a lower offer. I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm open to finding common ground, but I need to stay closer to my target price.  Let's try $965,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 965000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly, showing I'm still aiming for a higher value while demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise and emphasizing ""fairness"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes ""finalizing the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiations.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's offer.  The slight increase and urgency in the message encourage Bob to accept or potentially counter with an offer closer to mine.  My strategy is to gradually push Bob closer to my desired price while keeping my backup option with John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway. I suggest we settle on $962,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my target price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for a significantly higher price, giving me leverage. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can push for a better price with a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $965,000. While I'm willing to compromise, I won't settle for a price that's too far below my target. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to close the gap and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price before resorting to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  Let's split the difference and agree on $963,750. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 963750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This offer is exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows good faith.
* **Urgency:**  The message highlights the importance of ""closing the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  The offer is presented as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:**

By splitting the difference, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise and potentially close the deal in this round.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating with him or accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I would like to propose $962,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise and respects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation process with only two rounds remaining.
* **Incremental Gains:** Bob's offers are now incrementally decreasing, showing a reluctance to budge further.
* **John's Offer:** The guaranteed sale to John offers a significantly higher price than Bob's current offer.

**Strategy:**

Considering the limited rounds remaining and the diminishing returns from negotiation with Bob, it's strategically better to secure the guaranteed sale with John.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds outweighs the potential gain. By selling to John, I ensure a significant profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
