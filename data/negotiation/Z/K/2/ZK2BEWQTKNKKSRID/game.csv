"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's seal the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
