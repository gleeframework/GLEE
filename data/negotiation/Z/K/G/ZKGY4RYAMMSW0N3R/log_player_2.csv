You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is the same price as her initial offer in Round 1. While Bob could potentially continue to negotiate, it's important to consider the time factor.  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, saving Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. It's a smart move to avoid the potential of running out of rounds and having to settle for John's higher price."
