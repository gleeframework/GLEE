# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you. You can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is within your budget and saves you $100,000."
