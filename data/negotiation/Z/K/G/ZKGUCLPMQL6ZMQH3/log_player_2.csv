"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own value of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it's still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let's keep talking.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still slightly higher than his budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal. He can still purchase the product from John for a lower price, so it's worth continuing the negotiations with Alice to see if a better offer can be reached."
