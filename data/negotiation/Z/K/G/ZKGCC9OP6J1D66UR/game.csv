"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your ceiling, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a counteroffer of $815,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",815000.0,Alice,5,
