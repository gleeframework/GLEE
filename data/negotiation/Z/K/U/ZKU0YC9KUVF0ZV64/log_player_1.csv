Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he might get a deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and other interest, you create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is open for discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives it as a good deal or a necessity. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to aim higher initially."
