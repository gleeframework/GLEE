"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $12500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and my previous offer of $13500. I can sell it to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
