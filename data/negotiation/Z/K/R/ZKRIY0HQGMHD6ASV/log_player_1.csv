{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and still leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. I'm confident that I can sell it to John for $15,000 if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give it away for a price that doesn't reflect its worth.  I believe I can secure a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $10,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering Bob $10,500, which is halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to compromise, while still ensuring I get a decent price. If he still rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John and get my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to budge much further, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than $10,000.  I've already invested a lot of time and energy into negotiating with him, and it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the price I originally wanted."
