{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back to John's offer if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still better than nothing. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a higher offer from Bob. If I can't, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $105. I'd be willing to go up to $98 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and I'm not sure we'll be able to agree on a price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I can get a guaranteed $100, which is worth more than the risk of further negotiation."
