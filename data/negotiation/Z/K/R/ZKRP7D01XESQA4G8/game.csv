"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I see the value in the product,  $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $760,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to me.",795000.0,Alice,5,
