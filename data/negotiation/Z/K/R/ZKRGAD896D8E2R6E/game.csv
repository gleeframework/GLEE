"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700,000 to $800,000. I believe this price aligns more closely with what I am willing to invest in this purchase. Let's work towards finding a fair solution.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While $750,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. I'm open to a price of $850,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and allows us both to achieve a positive outcome. Let's keep the conversation going to find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
