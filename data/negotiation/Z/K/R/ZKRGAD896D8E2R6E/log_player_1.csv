Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700,000 to $800,000. I believe this price aligns more closely with what I am willing to invest in this purchase. Let's work towards finding a fair solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
