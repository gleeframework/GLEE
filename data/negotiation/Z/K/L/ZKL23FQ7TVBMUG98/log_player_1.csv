Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a significant opportunity, but if you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving Bob a potential bargain if he truly values the product.
* **Message:**  I'm aiming for a balance: 
    * **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the product's worth to me and imply it's a valuable opportunity. 
    * **Creating urgency:**  Mentioning John as a backup buyer creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
    * **Keeping it open ended:** I don't reveal too much about the product, leaving room for Bob to ask questions and potentially negotiate if he's interested."
