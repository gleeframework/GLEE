"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is above your maximum budget of $15,000, so accepting it wouldn't be a good deal.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price.  You have several rounds to try to get closer to your desired price point.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** The option to buy from John gives you leverage, but it's not a desirable outcome as it's your most expensive choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum value of $10,000, making it a potential starting point for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and see how close she might be to accepting a price closer to your ideal.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  There is still room to increase the price in future rounds if needed, giving you flexibility in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** $11,500 is still more than you want to pay. You have some room to negotiate further.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price. You still have time to get closer to your ideal price.
* **John is still a fallback:** While buying from John is an option, it's still the most expensive choice. You're better off trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, moving closer to Alice's last offer but still remaining below your ideal price point.
* **Testing willingness to meet halfway:** This move is designed to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for final deal:** While it's a higher price than your previous offer, there is still room to negotiate downwards if necessary, ensuring you don't overshoot your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your ideal:** $11,000 is closer to your desired price point than John's offer and is within your budget.
* **Limited time and risk:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John increases.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though you're accepting the offer, you can still try to negotiate a slightly lower price in future rounds if Alice is willing. This is a win-win situation, where you get the product at a good price and Alice also gets a sale."
