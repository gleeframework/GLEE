Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see value in. I believe a price of $950,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), I want to start high with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $950,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range above my minimum. 
* **Strategic justification:** By phrasing it as ""reflecting its worth,"" I'm subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind at a high point, even though he only values it at $800,000. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still offering Bob a seemingly fair deal."
