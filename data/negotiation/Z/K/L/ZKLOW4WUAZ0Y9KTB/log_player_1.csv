"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to bite.  I want to get as close to his maximum price as possible, but I also want to leave room for negotiation in case he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counter and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is still a good profit for me and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept, but it also leaves some room for further negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round. I have 6 rounds remaining and don't want to rush into selling if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering we are both approaching the middle ground. If he rejects, I might have to consider selling to John in the next round to avoid losing too much time and potentially missing a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's less than my ideal price, we're nearing the end of the rounds, and I'm getting closer to my minimum target. I'm also running the risk of Bob getting increasingly unwilling to negotiate, and selling to John might be the only option left.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk ending up with nothing."
