"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,100,000. It's a rare and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening offer but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a lower figure, we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 
* **Respectful communication:** We maintain a polite and appreciative tone to foster a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
