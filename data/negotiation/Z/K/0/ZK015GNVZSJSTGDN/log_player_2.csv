"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still above Alice's value of $10,000 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's a bit lower than her previous offer.  It's worth seeing if she will budge further by continuing to negotiate.  Bob can make a slightly higher counteroffer to see if they can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. By offering $11,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price than Alice's last offer. This is a reasonable counteroffer that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, but it's still a little high. There's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower, especially since Bob is willing to buy from John for $12,000. There are still five rounds remaining, providing enough time to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's last offer but is still trying to keep the price under $11,500.  Offering $11,250 is a compromise that shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to save money. This counteroffer is also a good starting point for further negotiations, as it leaves room for both parties to make concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $100 lower than John's price.  At this point, the negotiation is likely to drag on with small concessions and it's not clear that a deal below $11,900 will be reached. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $12,000,  it's not worth continuing the negotiation.  There are only three rounds remaining, and trying to save a small amount of money might not be worth the risk of not closing a deal at all."
