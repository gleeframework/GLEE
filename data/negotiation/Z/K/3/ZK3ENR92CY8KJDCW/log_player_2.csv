"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  This is a one-time opportunity to own something truly special. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  There's no incentive to accept it since you can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get a better deal from her or another seller in the future."
