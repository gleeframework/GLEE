Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $20,000 is a good starting point. It gives you room to negotiate downwards while still potentially getting a price you're happy with.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating you're open to negotiation shows you're willing to work with Bob, which can make him more inclined to engage.
* **No Lower than $15,000:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so you can't go lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range, potentially getting a better price than selling to John.

**Next Steps:** You'll want to send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between your desired price and his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This product is truly exceptional, and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $17,000 is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial price. This shows you're willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Highlight the value:** Remind Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to pay closer to your desired price.
* **Focus on a win-win:**  Use language like ""find a price that works for both of us"" to emphasize the collaborative nature of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's offer:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to the guaranteed $15,000 from John. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While $14,000 isn't terrible, there's still a chance to get closer to your desired price range. 
* **Minimal risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer means you can counter with a slightly higher price, potentially getting $14,500 or even $15,000. If that fails, you can always sell to John.

**Next Steps:** 

You should counter Bob with a price of $15,000, explaining that it's your final offer. If he rejects it, you can then immediately sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 is my final offer. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll be selling to John. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Stating this is your final offer creates pressure on Bob. He knows he's getting closer to the guaranteed price from John.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  Highlight the fairness of the offer to make Bob feel it's a good deal.
* **Clear Consequences:**  Mention selling to John if Bob declines. This adds urgency and motivates him to accept."
