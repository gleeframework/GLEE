"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for you to enjoy a substantial profit. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
