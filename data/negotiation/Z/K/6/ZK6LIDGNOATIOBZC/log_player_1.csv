Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can aim high with Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
