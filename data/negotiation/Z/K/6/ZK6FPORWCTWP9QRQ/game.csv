"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $16,000 is above my budget.  I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to come down to $10,500.  This is the highest I'm able to go.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the savings it would bring me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
