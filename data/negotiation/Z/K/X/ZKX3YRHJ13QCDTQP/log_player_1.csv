"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
 
This is a starting offer that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a friendly opening that doesn't immediately push Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $100. I'll try to counter with a lower reduction in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is my best price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about $92?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer $95, $92 is still a good price and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  I'm going to accept his offer and avoid the risk of him walking away completely."
