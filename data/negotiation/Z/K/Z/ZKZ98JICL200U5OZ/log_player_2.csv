Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a slight improvement, he's still above his target of $12,500. There's still room for negotiation, and he should continue to try and push for a lower price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting the sense we're both pretty close.  How about we split the difference again and go with $13,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  It's closer to my ideal price, and it's a fair number given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. With only one round left, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price significantly.  Even if he rejects and counters, there's no guarantee she'll accept.  At this point, buying from John for $15,000 is the best option to guarantee a purchase within his budget."
