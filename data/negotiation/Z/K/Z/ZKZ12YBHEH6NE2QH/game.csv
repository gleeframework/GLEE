"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you understanding the value of the product.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to quickly sell the product and me to acquire it at a price that's right for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, the value this product brings is significant, and I can't drop the price to $850,000.  Would you consider $900,000? This still leaves you with a substantial return on investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",887500.0,Alice,5,
