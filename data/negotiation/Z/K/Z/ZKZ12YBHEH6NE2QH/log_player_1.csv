Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you understanding the value of the product.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to quickly sell the product and me to acquire it at a price that's right for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.
