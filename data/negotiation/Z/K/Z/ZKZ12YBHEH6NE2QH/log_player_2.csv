Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, the value this product brings is significant, and I can't drop the price to $850,000.  Would you consider $900,000? This still leaves you with a substantial return on investment.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can reach a more agreeable price. With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to explore better options."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer, as further negotiations may not yield a better price, and we're already nearing the end of the rounds."
