"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a significant profit as well.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to benefit from the product's value to you, while also giving me a significant profit. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This offer represents a fair price for both of us, and ensures a quick and efficient transaction.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
