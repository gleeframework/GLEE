"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize my profit. It also highlights the value Bob will gain from the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high. Considering my budget and the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'll try to counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it still doesn't reach my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to counter Bob's offer again, hoping to squeeze out a slightly better deal before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiation. Let's close this deal at a price we both feel good about."", ""product_price"": 925000}
