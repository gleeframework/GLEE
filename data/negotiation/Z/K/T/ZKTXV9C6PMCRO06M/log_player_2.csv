"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's product may be unique, the initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a lower price point and encourages Alice to negotiate. He's aiming for a price close to his maximum budget, but leaving room for some potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its uniqueness and value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer to his desired price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering again.  He wants to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice his maximum budget, hoping to close the deal at his desired price. He's highlighting the fairness of the offer, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of compromise.  This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10800. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While she's getting closer, Bob has already rejected her offer at $10,500, and it's likely she'll continue to hold out for a price closer to her initial asking price.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $10,000, guaranteeing he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
