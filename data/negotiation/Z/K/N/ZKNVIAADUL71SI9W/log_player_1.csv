Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I believe a price of $10,000 would be fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the middle ground between your minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **First Mover Advantage:** Offering a seemingly fair deal upfront might encourage Bob to accept without further negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You secure a guaranteed $8,000 from John if Bob declines, so there's an incentive to aim higher with Bob."
