Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. Time to push back a bit more firmly."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's time to accept. We're getting into diminishing returns territory. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're already significantly above John's offer. Taking the $965,000 secures a great profit."
