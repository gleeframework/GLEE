"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true value.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment I've made in it.  Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I could make a firm offer at $750,000. This is a fair price considering the market and the value it brings to my business.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $750,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000,  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
