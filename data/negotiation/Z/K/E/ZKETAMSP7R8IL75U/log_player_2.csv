# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $1,050,000 is a decent price. It's worth it to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
