Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get the highest price possible.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation downward while still aiming for a price above Bob's valuation and our minimum.
* **John as a Backup:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or willingness to pay more than his valuation.
* If we had more information about Bob, we could adjust our strategy accordingly."
