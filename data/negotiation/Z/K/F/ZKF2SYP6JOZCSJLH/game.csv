"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9500. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500, but I'm still a bit stretched. Would you be willing to do $9000? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm very interested in the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $9500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there!",9500.0,Alice,5,
