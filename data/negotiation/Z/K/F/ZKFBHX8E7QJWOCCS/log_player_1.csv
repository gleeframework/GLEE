"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price slightly higher than the product's worth to him. This gives him a small incentive to negotiate, while still leaving me some room to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not where I want it to be.  I'm going to see if I can get him to move a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise offer, closer to Bob's last counteroffer.  I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair meeting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum price. While there's a chance we could come to an agreement in the next few rounds, I'm not confident enough to risk it.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me my minimum value and ensures a quick and secure deal."
