"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is clearly inflating the perceived value. While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or going with John."
