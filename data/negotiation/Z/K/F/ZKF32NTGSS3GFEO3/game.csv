"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
