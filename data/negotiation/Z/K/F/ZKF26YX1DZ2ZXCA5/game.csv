"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000. This price aligns well with my budget, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, my initial offer was already a significant discount from the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with your budget and still reflects the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
