"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above my ideal price. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down a bit, especially since she's already acknowledged the product's value to me."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, my initial offer was already a significant discount from the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with your budget and still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000 which is a good price considering she started at $1,200,000.  While I'd still prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate might risk her going back to her original offer, or even worse, refusing to negotiate further. 

At this price, I'm saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, and it's still within my budget. It's a good deal for both of us."
