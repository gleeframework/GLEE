"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering both of our positions. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, as it's already below my minimum target. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
