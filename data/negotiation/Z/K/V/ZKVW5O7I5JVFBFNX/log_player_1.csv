"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a fair starting price is $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to his valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $950,000 offer signals a willingness to negotiate while still placing a strong emphasis on the product's worth.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the safety net of John's offer ($800,000), so we can afford to be somewhat assertive in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both his valuation and our minimum acceptable price. While it's good to know he's interested, accepting this offer would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. We are better off countering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this price point reflects the value you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm (But Flexible):** We're reducing our initial ask by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above Bob's low offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's inherent value to Bob, hopefully encouraging him to move closer to his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Time Consideration:** While we have several rounds left, we don't want to drag out the negotiation unnecessarily. This offer puts the ball back in Bob's court and encourages a more reasonable counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $800,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Expectations:** Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Fair Deal:** While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer represents a fair compromise, especially considering he values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a solid profit."
