"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the benefits you'll get from having it. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
