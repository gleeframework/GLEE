"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than your offer. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,500,000, Bob. However, I was thinking that since you're so close to your maximum budget, I could offer you a slight discount. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,520,000. This is still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
