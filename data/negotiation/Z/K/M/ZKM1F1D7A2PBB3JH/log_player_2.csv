Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is within a reasonable range of my desired price. Accepting her offer in this round is a good decision:

* **It secures the product:**  While I could potentially push for a lower price, I risk losing the deal entirely.
* **It's a good price:**  $1,025,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing the deal with Alice increases.

While I could potentially counteroffer again, accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and within a reasonable time frame."
