"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I know its value to you is high, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  While $950,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a significant profit for me, and gives you a great deal on this valuable product.  Let's continue to work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal this round.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant commitment from me, and I believe it's a fair price for the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This represents a strong compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on this product.  Let's make this happen in this round.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
