Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still aiming for a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $85. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but lower than my initial offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm choosing to sell to John. It's a sure deal that guarantees me my minimum price, and further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price or a protracted negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal to John, who is a reliable buyer at my desired price."
