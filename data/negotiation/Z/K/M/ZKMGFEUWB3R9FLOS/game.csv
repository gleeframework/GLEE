"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $150. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in the product and would be happy to pay $120. This is a fair price considering I can get a similar product from John for $100. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $160. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me is still at least $150. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $140? This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's a good deal for me and you'd still get more than what John is offering. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $155. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
