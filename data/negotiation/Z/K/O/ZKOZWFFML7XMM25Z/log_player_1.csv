Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum desired price of $150. I'm curious to see if Bob is interested at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150.  I'm not willing to accept it. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $175.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I hope this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to earn more, it's not worth risking further negotiation with the potential of Bob walking away completely. I'm going to accept his offer."
