# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the product with you, Bob! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Considering its worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering I could easily sell it to John for $1,200,000. What do you think?
