"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $1,100,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  how about we split the difference? I'll accept $1,400,000.  Let's meet in the middle, and finalize this.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be open to that figure?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price. $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $1,300,000?  That's a reasonable middle ground, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
