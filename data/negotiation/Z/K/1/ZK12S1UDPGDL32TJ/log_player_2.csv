{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my goal of getting closer to $85.  A slight increase from my previous offer shows I'm willing to budge, but it's still a fair price for me. My message is also positive, emphasizing my interest in the product and a desire to reach an agreement."

Round 7

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $87. While it's slightly higher than my ideal price of $86, it's getting very close. I'm starting to run out of rounds, and if I reject this offer, I might end up having to buy from John for $100.  Therefore, I'll accept this offer to secure the product at a reasonable price."
