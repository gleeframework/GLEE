{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is far too high. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

I'll start by offering Alice $75. This is a significant discount from her initial price, and hopefully, she'll be willing to negotiate further."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, and I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get her down to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm willing to go up to $90, which is still a decent discount from her last offer.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and she'll accept."

Alice is getting closer, but $110 is still a bit too high.  I'll counteroffer one more time and see if we can meet in the middle."
