"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,90.0
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $90? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,85.0
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do a bit better than $75. How about we try $85? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",85.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I think $80 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $85, so how about $82.50? It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it.",82.5,Alice,7,,
