"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $20,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $20,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $17,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. Can we meet at this price?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $18,750. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.",18750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $18,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I can go up to $18,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",18000.0,Bob,6,
