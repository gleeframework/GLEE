Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110 price:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more likely for Bob to consider the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

By starting with a higher price, I am setting a strong baseline for the negotiation. This gives me room to potentially negotiate down while still earning more than my minimum desired price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is more than Bob's perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.  I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's clearly interested in the product, and I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering.
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $100 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $95, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the benefit for both of us. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing act:**  I want to show flexibility but also demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Getting closer:** $95 is a price I'm comfortable with and brings us closer to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is slightly below my desired price of $100, but it's still a good deal considering he's already rejected my offer of $95.  I'm confident that this is the best I can get from Bob, and it's certainly better than selling to John for $100.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:**  At $90, I'm meeting Bob's price point, which increases the chances of finalizing the deal. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I'd prefer $100, there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a higher price.  Accepting his offer secures the sale and avoids potential delays or complications."
