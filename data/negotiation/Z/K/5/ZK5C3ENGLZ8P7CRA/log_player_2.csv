# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While $140 is lower than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You are better off rejecting this offer and going with John."
