**Reasoning:**

Bob has been extremely stubborn, sticking to his $800,000 offer for three rounds. This indicates he's unlikely to budge significantly. Continuing the negotiation risks wasting valuable time and potentially losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to cut bait and take the sure profit."
