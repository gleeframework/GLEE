"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration, I've decided to offer this product to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This represents a significant value compared to its market worth of $10,000 and my asking price, while higher than Bob's perceived value, still offers a substantial return on investment for me. I understand that you might need time to consider this offer, so please let me know if you have any questions or require further information about the product. I look forward to your response.
