Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount for Bob, but it still leaves me with a profit of $40, which is better than selling to John for $80. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still gives me a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $80. It's also likely that if I reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, he might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with no sale. Accepting his offer at least guarantees me a profit."
