"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects the true worth of its potential. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand you have a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? ",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $8,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. I could be persuaded to go down to $8,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
