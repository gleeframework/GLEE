"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can be a game-changer for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, I aim to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm fully aware that this initial offer is unlikely to be immediately accepted. However, it provides ample room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** I have the security of knowing that John is willing to pay $1,000,000. This knowledge allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer would leave a potential $200,000 on the table (compared to my initial asking price). I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,550,000."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer ($250,000 decrease) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and move towards a deal. 
* **Holding Ground:**  However, I'm not meeting Bob in the middle completely.  My counteroffer is still significantly above both his offer and my minimum acceptable price, allowing room for further negotiation.
* **Time Consideration:** As we progress through the rounds, I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and how much closer he gets to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but $1,550,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to concede yet. His counteroffer decreased by less than half of my previous concession, signaling that he is willing to go higher. I will counteroffer with a smaller price drop to test his resolve and keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget limitations. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant offer on a truly unique product."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $150,000, a smaller concession than my previous one. This signals that I'm becoming less flexible as we approach my bottom line.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing its uniqueness.  
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the possibility of a deal with John becomes more appealing. By round 7 or 8, I'll need to seriously consider taking John's offer if Bob hasn't significantly increased his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,000,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay. It's unlikely he'll budge significantly from this position.
* **Matching Offer:** John's offer is already at Bob's maximum. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as it's highly improbable that I can secure a better deal.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting John's offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and the risk of Bob not budging from his $1,000,000 offer. 

While I aimed higher initially, securing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the most logical decision at this point."
