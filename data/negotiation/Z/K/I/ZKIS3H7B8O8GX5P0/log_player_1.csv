Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. I think it's a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm not sure I can go that high.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial offer, and it's already at my minimum threshold. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lower the price even further."
