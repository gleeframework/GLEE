"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
