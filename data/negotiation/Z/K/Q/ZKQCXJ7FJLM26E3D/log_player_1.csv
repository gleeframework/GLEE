Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price that is closer to my desired outcome but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and making it clear that I believe it's a good deal for Bob.
* **Opening for Discussion:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts, setting the stage for a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that doesn't at least cover my minimum.
* **I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob.**  He's already shown interest and values the product highly.  There's room for compromise.
* **Selling to John is a backup option, but not my preferred choice.**  I'd rather explore getting closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why my price is justified.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm stating my willingness to find a solution that benefits both of us, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is within my acceptable range.**  It's above my minimum price of $8,000 and closer to my desired outcome.
* **Time is a factor.** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob completely. 
* **Selling to John is still a fallback option, but I'm closer to a deal with Bob.**

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
