{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a very good price, but it's likely Alice can go lower. We have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by 33%. This is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly. I'm still well within my budget, and there's no need to rush into a deal this early."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down, which is good. However,  $5,500 is still above my desired price.  I'll counteroffer again to try and push for a lower price. I still have a lot of negotiating rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $4,500.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to meet her halfway. I'm still comfortable with this price, and we're getting closer to a deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down but still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal. There's still a lot of negotiating room, and we're only halfway through the rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  I'm getting closer to my target price, and I believe Alice will be more receptive to this offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating.  Even though we're getting closer to the end of the rounds, I still think we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll counteroffer again and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still staying below Alice's last offer.  I believe we are getting close to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still keeping it within my budget. There are only two rounds left, so I need to find a solution that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It is getting close to my budget, but I am not willing to pay that much at this point. There is still one round left to try to negotiate a better price. I believe we can reach a deal that works for both of us."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice that I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm still within my budget and I believe this price is fair. It's a good compromise and a reasonable final offer. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John for $15,000, which is not ideal."
