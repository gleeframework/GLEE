"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for this product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which is $10,750. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. This is a very fair price, considering the value I place on the product and the price I can get from John. Let's finalize this deal.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is the midpoint between your last offer and my previous offer. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
