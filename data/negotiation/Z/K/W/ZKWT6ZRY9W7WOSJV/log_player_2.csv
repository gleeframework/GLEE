"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so it makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves you room to negotiate upward while staying well below your $100 maximum. Starting low might encourage Alice to come down in price more aggressively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a little, but $130 is still too high. You know you have a fallback option with John, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's above your budget. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a strict budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice that you are willing to move closer to her price, but you are still aiming to stay within a reasonable range of your budget.  You've offered more than your fallback option, indicating serious interest, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
