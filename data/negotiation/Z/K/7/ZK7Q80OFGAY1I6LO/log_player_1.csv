Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make an offer of $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.
