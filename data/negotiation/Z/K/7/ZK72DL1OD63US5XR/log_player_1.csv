"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'd like to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price. While $8,000 is my bottom line, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still interested in purchasing the product and am willing to pay $8,200 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to secure a slightly higher amount. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can get him to come up a bit more. I have enough rounds left that I don't need to rush into accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $8,300 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 8300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am willing to pay $8,250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at a point where the price is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're quickly approaching the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's highly unlikely that Bob will increase his offer further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price for the product, even if it's not the absolute highest I could have hoped for."
