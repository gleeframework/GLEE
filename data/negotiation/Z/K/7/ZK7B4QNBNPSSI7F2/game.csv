"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of its value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to go up to $900,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I'm confident it's a price that would be mutually beneficial.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our negotiation and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm still committed to reaching a deal with you.  $950,000 remains a bit too high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a fair compromise considering my previous offer and your recent proposal.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
