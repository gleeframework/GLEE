"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $60 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $40?",40.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $40. How about we meet in the middle at $55? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",55.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about $45? That's a fair compromise, I think.",45.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $45. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $55 and $45, which would be $50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",50.0,Alice,5,
