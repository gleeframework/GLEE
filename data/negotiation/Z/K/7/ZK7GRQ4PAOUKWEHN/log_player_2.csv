"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. I understand it's worth $1500000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please consider my offer of $1550000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions or concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is only $50,000 more than Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his target.  He can get the product for his maximum budget from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob."
