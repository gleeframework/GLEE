"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you an amazing deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $100 is a better price than John's $120, there's room for negotiation.  Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
