"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that's still below the value I place on the product. This allows for room to negotiate and gives Bob a reason to engage.  I'm also framing the offer as a unique opportunity to encourage him to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. I would like to propose a price of $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is at the minimum value I'm willing to accept. There's no room for further negotiation to get a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me the minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
