Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth a substantial investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell for less than your minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial high price helps gauge Bob's interest level and potential budget. His response will guide your next move. 
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, allowing him to justify a higher price in his own mind if he truly believes it's worth that much to him.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is highly price-sensitive or unlikely to negotiate, you might adjust the initial offer downwards. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive starting price might be preferable.

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation where you can potentially maximize your profit."
