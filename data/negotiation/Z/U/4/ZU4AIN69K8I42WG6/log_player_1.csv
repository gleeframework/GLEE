"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a fair starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also aware that I have other options if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $140. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm going to counter with $122. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  I'm still above my minimum price, and I only have 5 rounds left before I have to consider selling to John."
