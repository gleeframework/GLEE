Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to sell for at least $12,000 (John's offer).
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Negotiation space:** There's a $3,000 difference between our positions.
* **My ideal outcome:** I want to get as close to $15,000 as possible.

By offering $14,000, I'm leaving $1,000 on the table for Bob, which should make the offer attractive to him. This gives me a better chance of getting a higher price than John's offer, while still potentially leaving some room for negotiation."
