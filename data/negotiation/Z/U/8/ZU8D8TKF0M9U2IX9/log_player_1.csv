Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try to get a little closer to my target price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $90.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.50 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $85.50 is a reasonable compromise and gets me closer to my minimum price of $80. I don't want to risk him walking away and ending up with nothing."
