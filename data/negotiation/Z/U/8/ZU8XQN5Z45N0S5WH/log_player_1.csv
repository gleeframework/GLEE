Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message signals that you're open to a compromise. 

This strategy aims to find a price within the bargaining zone (between $120 and $150) that benefits you while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:**  $130 is more than your minimum selling price of $120.
* **Limited negotiating space:** You've already made a first offer, and Bob's counteroffer is close to your minimum.  There's not much room for further negotiation to potentially increase your profit.
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If you reject Bob's offer, you risk a protracted negotiation that might lead to him walking away, forcing you to sell to John for a lower price. 

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a quick sale at a decent profit."
