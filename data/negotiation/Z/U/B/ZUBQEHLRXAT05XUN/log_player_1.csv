"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and leaves some wiggle room in case Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Setting the Tone:** My message is friendly and professional, emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Round 1 Strategy:** In the first round, it's important to gauge Bob's interest and get a sense of his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm only interested in buying this product if it's priced under my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, it does indicate he's interested in the product. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about my value and willing to negotiate.  It also allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that aligns with my goals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that I believe is fair considering the product's value.  Please let me know if you're willing to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price significantly higher than my minimum.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  By offering $1,700,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while also leaving room for potential further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and justifies the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $1700000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800000. I'm serious about purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to his low offer of $800,000, and I've already made a significant compromise in the previous round.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're only in round 4, and I'm running out of time to negotiate a price that meets my minimum. 
* **Safeguard:**  Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and protects me from accepting a much lower offer from Bob.  

**While I'd like to get a better price, the risk of Bob refusing further compromises and running down the clock is too high. It's better to secure the $1,500,000 sale now.**"
