"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we settle on $100?  This would be a great price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
