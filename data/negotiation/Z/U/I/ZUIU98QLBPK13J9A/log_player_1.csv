{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The price is below Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It's easy for Bob to understand.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price. You can also use this offer to see if Bob is willing to play ball or if you should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than your minimum, it's still a significant drop from your initial asking price and leaves less room for further negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to go down to $110. This reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
