Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially saving you considerable costs and increasing efficiency. I'm initially offering it at $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While knowing Bob's valuation helps, Alice holds a strong position with John as a guaranteed backup.  Starting higher leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's benefits without revealing specifics, aiming to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially offering"" signals potential flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price is slightly below the midpoint between Bob's valuation and Alice's minimum. This aims to secure a significant profit while still being enticing for Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a good chance of closing the deal with Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer."
