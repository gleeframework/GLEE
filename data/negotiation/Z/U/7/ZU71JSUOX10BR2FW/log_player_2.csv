"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12500.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to earn a bit more than my minimum requirement.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my minimum price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
