I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still exceeding my minimum value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is not willing to come up to my minimum price.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting a lower price from Bob."
