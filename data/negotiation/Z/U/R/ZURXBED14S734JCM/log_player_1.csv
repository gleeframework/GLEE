Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but not unreasonable allows for some negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value"" to make the price seem more justifiable to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes we don't know how eager Bob is to buy or if he has other options. If we had more information about Bob's situation, we could potentially push for a higher price."
