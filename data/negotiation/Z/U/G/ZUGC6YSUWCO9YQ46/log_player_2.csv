"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for a price that's sure to be a great deal for you. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm happy to consider your offer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is clearly motivated to sell.** Her message emphasizes how good the deal is for you, suggesting she might be willing to go lower.  
* **You have a fallback option.** Even if Alice refuses to negotiate, you can buy from John for $12,000.
* **Potential for savings:** By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that her price is too high, potentially prompting her to lower it. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice and save more than the $2,000 difference between her initial offer and John's price."
