"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  I'm hoping this will give me some room to negotiate down if needed. It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm still confident that I can sell to John for $8,000 if I need to.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I could sell it to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,000.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my original asking price, this is a good deal considering I could have sold to John for $8,000. It's important to keep in mind that I have limited rounds and don't want to risk losing a sale altogether."
