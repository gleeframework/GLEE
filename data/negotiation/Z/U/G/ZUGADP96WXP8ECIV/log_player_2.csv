"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while leaving some room for profit for you.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll be moving forward with another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum and significantly less than John's $1,500,000 offer. Accepting this offer saves you money."
