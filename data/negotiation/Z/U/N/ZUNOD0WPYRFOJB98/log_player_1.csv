"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. My starting price is $1,200,000. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a high price, aiming for a larger share of the potential surplus.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm framing the product as valuable and a good fit for Bob, potentially making him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to counter. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $800,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $900000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  I need to earn at least $800,000, and Bob's offer is below that. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer is tempting,  I have 8 rounds left to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to push for a higher price.  

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial $1,200,000 but being flexible based on how much I want to secure a deal with Bob. I'll need to consider how willing I am to risk losing the deal with Bob and falling back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $900,000 is a bit too low given the product's value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This still leaves you a significant margin for profit, and I'm confident this will be a successful investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential to persuade Bob to accept.
* **Fair Price:** The counteroffer leaves a significant profit margin for Bob while also exceeding my minimum price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm still holding out for a higher price, but recognizing the need to be reasonable to secure a deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will be closely watching Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I will have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value and potential of the product, I think $950000 would be a fair price for us both. I hope this proposal is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are only on Round 4, and it's likely the price won't go up significantly. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I continue to reject Bob's offer, there is a risk he will walk away, and I might be forced to sell to John for a lower price. 

**Next Steps:** 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether. I'll be ready to negotiate with John if I need to, but for now, this is the best option."
