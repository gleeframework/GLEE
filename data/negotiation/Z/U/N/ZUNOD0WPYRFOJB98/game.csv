"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $900000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $900000 is a bit too low given the product's value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1050000. This still leaves you a significant margin for profit, and I'm confident this will be a successful investment for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
