"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to you, and you have a guaranteed alternative at that price from John. 
* Alice is offering the product for $90, which is still above your maximum price point.
* Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy the product from John, which is your best option in this scenario."
