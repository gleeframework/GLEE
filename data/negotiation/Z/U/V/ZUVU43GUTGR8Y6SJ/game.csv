"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $10,250 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can get to $10,250, but I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. This is as high as I'm willing to go",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,750 is a good offer, but I need a bit more to make this work.  How about $10,000?  It's just a small increase, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $10,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll meet you at $9,500",9500.0,Bob,8,
