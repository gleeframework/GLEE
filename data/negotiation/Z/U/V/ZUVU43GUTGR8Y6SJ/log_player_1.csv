"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and initiate the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I have 10 rounds to reach a better agreement.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Considering John:** Although selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm not desperate yet. I have rounds to negotiate and might be able to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,500.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that this is still a great deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiations by asking ""What do you think?"". This allows Bob to counter with a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I have 6 rounds remaining to try and get closer to my target price. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive.
* **Considering John:**  Although selling to John for $15,000 is appealing, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price with Bob. The risk is that Bob might eventually walk away, leaving me with no deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $10,250 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between my last offer ($10,500) and his offer ($10,000).
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, emphasizing the benefit for both of us. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm trying to close the deal by making a concrete offer and asking for a decision. This puts pressure on Bob to either accept or counter with a final offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can get to $10,250, but I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. This is as high as I'm willing to go

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I have 4 rounds remaining to try and get closer to my target price. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,750 is a good offer, but I need a bit more to make this work.  How about $10,000?  It's just a small increase, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm only increasing my offer by $250 from Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still need to get closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasizing Progress:** I'm framing this offer as a small step towards a deal, encouraging Bob to see the finish line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to allow Bob to respond and potentially propose a final price."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to the final 2 rounds. The negotiation has stalled, and Bob seems determined to stick to his price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** There is a real risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with no deal at all.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired price and ensures a successful transaction. The risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high, given the limited time remaining."
