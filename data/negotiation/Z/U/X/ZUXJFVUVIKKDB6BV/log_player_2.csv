"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential value, $1,800,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to negotiate significantly below Alice's asking price.  A starting offer of $1,200,000 gives me room to move upward while still staying well below my maximum budget.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states my position that the price is unacceptable. I don't want to offend her, as a good relationship could lead to a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer signals that I'm serious but leaves space for Alice to counter.  I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,600,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair offer considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's compromise is better, but $1,600,000 is still above my $1,500,000 maximum. I know I can get the product for that price from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she might be open to further price reductions.
* **Strategic Delay:**  By rejecting and countering, I'm hoping Alice might become more flexible as time goes on.  She might be motivated to avoid losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my budget for this product is $1,500,000.  If you're able to work within that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm being upfront about my budget limit. This shows Alice I'm serious and avoids drawn-out negotiations.
* **Final Offer:** By presenting this as my firm limit, I'm signaling that this is my best and final offer. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" adds a touch of urgency, potentially motivating Alice to accept.
* **John as Backup:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm comfortable walking away and buying from John for my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your transparency, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $1,550,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's still above my maximum budget.
* **John's Price is Better:**  I know I can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's no point in paying more.
* **Avoiding Further Haggling:** It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and I've already invested time in negotiation. It's time to execute my backup plan."
