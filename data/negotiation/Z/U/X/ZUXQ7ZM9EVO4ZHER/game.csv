"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $900000 for the product. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $825000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $850000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I hope this is something you can work with.",850000.0,Alice,5,
