"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you it's worth at least $15000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. While she claims the product is worth more to her, that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth that much to you.  Rejecting her offer allows you to purchase the same product from John for a much lower price."
