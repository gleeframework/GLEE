"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000), but still below your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting her offer allows you to counter with a lower price, potentially saving you more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've done my research and I'm confident that this product is worth more than $1,250,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, $1,350,000 is still above the product's worth to her. It's also closer to John's price. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get Alice closer to your desired price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter again, potentially driving the price down further."
