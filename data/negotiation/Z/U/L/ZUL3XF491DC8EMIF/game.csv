,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $19500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",19500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $18250. I can offer you a price of $19500 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal.
