"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob starts with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This shows he's serious about negotiating and  gives him room to compromise later.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $75 is still within Bob's budget, but it's a substantial discount, making it more likely Alice will consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Bob's message leaves room for Alice to counter, suggesting flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has lowered her price, $90 is still above Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob has already demonstrated he's willing to negotiate, so there's still potential for a better deal.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  It's still early in the negotiation, so there's no need to rush into a decision.  Bob can continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. How about $80?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating that he's willing to meet Alice halfway. This makes him seem reasonable and increases the chances of a deal.
* **Focus on Budget:** Bob emphasizes his budget constraint to further justify his offer. This subtly implies that he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Expressing Interest:**  He reaffirms his interest in the product, showing Alice that he's serious about buying it, but only at the right price."
