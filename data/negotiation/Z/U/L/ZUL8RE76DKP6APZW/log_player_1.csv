"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $12,000. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me and the potential for further negotiation."
