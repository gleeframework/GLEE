"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $64. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $64
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $64, it's a good deal. However, you can try to save more money by making a counteroffer.  You want to see if you can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to get the price down as much as possible.  Offering $55 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and might encourage her to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $60 is a good deal. It's still a significant saving from the $80 you're willing to pay, and it's only $5 more than your previous counteroffer.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the next round, so it's best to accept this offer and close the deal."
