"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That way we both get a fair price.  Let me know what you think!",102.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair bit closer to my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100, but that's the lowest I can go.  It's still a good price for you, and it's important for me to get a fair deal.  Let me know what you decide.",100.0,Alice,5,
