Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters. I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to sell for, and selling to John would net me the same amount.  I'll take the deal and avoid the potential for further negotiation."
