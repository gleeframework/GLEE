"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a price I can work with.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750? Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference one more time. How about $8,875? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $8,750, and that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
