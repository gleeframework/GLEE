"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher than that.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $102. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
