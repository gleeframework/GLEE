"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's the best we can do.  Let me know your thoughts.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1075000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1050000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
