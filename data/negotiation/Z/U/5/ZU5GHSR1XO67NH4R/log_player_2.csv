"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1100000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant price reduction from what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, he can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating further. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, Bob has a clear benchmark to aim for."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $1,050,000."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's the best we can do.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, he can potentially still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, Bob has a clear benchmark and should keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1050000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **The price is favorable:** Alice is now offering the product at $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than John's price. 
* **Negotiation risk:** Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice rejecting further offers and potentially asking for a higher price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking the deal falling through for the sake of a small price difference.

By accepting this offer, Bob secures the product for a price that's very close to his ideal and ensures a successful deal."
