Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, starting with a significantly higher offer ($2,000,000) creates room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Confident Language:**  Using positive and confident language about the product's value emphasizes its worth to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By inviting questions and further discussion, you signal flexibility while still aiming for a higher selling price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still respecting Bob's position as a valuable potential buyer."
