"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, but I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
