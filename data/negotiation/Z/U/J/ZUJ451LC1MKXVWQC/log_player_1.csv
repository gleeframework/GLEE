Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
