"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm confident this product will be worth more than that for you. How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000? This way, we both come out ahead."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This would give us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although $875,000 is getting closer to my goal, I still believe we can find a better middle ground.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired $900,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I appreciate your offer, $875,000 still undervalues the product for you. Let's meet at $890,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
