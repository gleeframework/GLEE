"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your target price of $1,000,000, and you can still get the product from John for that price.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price.  

Rejecting the offer allows you to control the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm confident this product will be worth more than that for you. How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000? This way, we both come out ahead. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000, and you can get the product from John for that price.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** You have 7 rounds remaining, and there's still room to negotiate a lower price.  

Rejecting the offer allows you to keep pushing for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I appreciate your offer, $875,000 still undervalues the product for you. Let's meet at $890,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $890,000 is less than your $1,000,000 limit from John.
* **Negotiation has reached a reasonable point:** While you could potentially negotiate further, the difference is small, and you're getting a decent price.
* **Time is a factor:** You have only 5 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price and saves time."
