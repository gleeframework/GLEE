"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on it.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900000 is a significant amount, it's below what I believe the product is worth. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1200000. This still leaves room for a substantial profit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a significant investment in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
