Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice. Alice's offer of $7,400 is still higher than my desired price, and I'm running out of time. 

Considering that I can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's more advantageous to accept John's offer. This guarantees me the product at a price that's within my budget, even though it's not the absolute lowest possible price.  Further negotiation with Alice may lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of not closing the deal is too high."
