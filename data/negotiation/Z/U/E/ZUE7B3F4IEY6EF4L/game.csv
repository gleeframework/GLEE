"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and allows me to make a substantial profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This still gives you a considerable advantage, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
