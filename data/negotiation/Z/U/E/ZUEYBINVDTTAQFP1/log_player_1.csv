"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. Since I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, I'm not willing to go lower. This will let Bob know I'm serious about getting my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  I'm not willing to sell for that low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still closer to my desired value than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show him that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, hoping to reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,050,000. This is a big compromise, but I believe it's still within my acceptable range. This offer demonstrates I'm serious about working with Bob while also ensuring I don't sacrifice too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is finally in the acceptable range for me. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and I'm worried that continuing to negotiate could risk losing him as a buyer entirely. I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer and go back to him, he might not be willing to increase his offer further.  It's time to close the deal."
