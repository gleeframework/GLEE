"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to start by rejecting the initial offer. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $1,200,000 when you can get it from John for $1,000,000. We'll use the next rounds to see if we can get Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Starting with a counteroffer of $900,000 is a good strategy. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price and leaves room for negotiation, while still being a fair price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still higher than what you are willing to pay. Continue negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

We'll increase our offer to $950,000. This shows Alice we're serious about buying the product, while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer! While Alice's offer is tempting, we're still $50,000 above our target price. Let's see if we can get her to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

We're going to make a final counteroffer at our target price of $1,000,000. If Alice accepts, we get the product at our desired price. If she rejects, we'll simply buy it from John.  There's no need to continue negotiating if we can get it for our target price."
