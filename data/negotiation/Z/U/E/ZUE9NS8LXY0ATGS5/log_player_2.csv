"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than $10000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own costs. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has a solid alternative in John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price or to ultimately purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your costs, but $11,000 is still above my limit. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This is a fair price, considering my budget and your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11250 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product and our desire to come to an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While there are still 5 rounds left, Bob has a clear alternative with John who is willing to sell the product for his desired price. It's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer from John and secure the product for his budget. Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it also risks the deal falling apart and Bob potentially missing out on the product altogether."
