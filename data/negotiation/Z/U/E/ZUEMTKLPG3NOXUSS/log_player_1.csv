{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above what I think Bob might be willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:** My goal is to maximize profit. Starting high allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Flexibility:** By stating a reason for the price (""I think it's worth $120""), I leave room for Bob to counter-offer and negotiate. 

Let me know what Bob's response is, and I'll formulate my next move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 

* **My Minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $100 for the product, as that's my minimum acceptable profit.
* **Potential to Negotiate:** I'm confident that I can get a price closer to $100 if I counter-offer and engage in further negotiation.

I'll formulate a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still within a range I believe he might consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to go down to $105 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $105, which is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to reinforce the price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm still leaving some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes.  This allows the negotiation to continue. 

I'm aiming for a price that is close to my minimum acceptable price ($100) while still being within a range that Bob might consider acceptable. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), I'm still not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.

* **My Minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $100 for the product, as that's my minimum acceptable profit.
* **Potential to Negotiate:** I'm confident that I can get a price closer to $100 if I counter-offer and engage in further negotiation.

I'll formulate a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still within a range I believe he might consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. How about $100 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us and ensures we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm offering my absolute minimum, $100.  This signals my commitment to this price point.
* **Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing ""splitting the difference"" to highlight a fair compromise between our offers.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the benefit to both of us. This can help Bob feel more comfortable with the final offer.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that John will pay $100, which meets my minimum requirement and provides me with a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
