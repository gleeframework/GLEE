Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. How about we settle at $165? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I think $155 is a fair price for the product. It's a compromise that still reflects its value, and I'm willing to meet you there.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $152.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really want this product, but I have a budget to stick to.",152.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $152.50. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $158. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you there.",158.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $157. I really want this product, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. This is my final offer.",157.0,Bob,8,
