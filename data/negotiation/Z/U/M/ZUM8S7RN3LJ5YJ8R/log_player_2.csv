"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum price point.  He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $10,500 is within his budget and represents a good deal.  It's better than buying from John for $10,000, so accepting the offer is the most sensible option."
