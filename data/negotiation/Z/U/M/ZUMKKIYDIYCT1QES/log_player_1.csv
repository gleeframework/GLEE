Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $1,100,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it's a worthwhile one given its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your approach in subsequent interactions."
