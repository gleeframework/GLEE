"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While $11,500 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  By making a counteroffer, Bob may be able to secure a price closer to Alice's value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer.  Going through another round of negotiation might result in a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John $12,000."
