Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a discounted price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $120, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $110 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) and gives him a perceived ""deal.""
* **First-Refusal Incentive:** Offering it to Bob first at a ""discount"" might make him more inclined to accept before you offer it to someone else. 

**Important:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, by starting higher than your minimum acceptable price, you maximize your potential profit."
