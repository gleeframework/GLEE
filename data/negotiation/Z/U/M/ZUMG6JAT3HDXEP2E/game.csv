,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  However, $6,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $8,000 to you. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,250 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close. I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  How about $7,500? That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
