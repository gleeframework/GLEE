"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping to find a more mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but also allows for a more reasonable margin for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,112,500? This considers both of our positions.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but allows me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
