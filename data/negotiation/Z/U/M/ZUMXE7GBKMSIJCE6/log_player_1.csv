Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping to find a more mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but also allows for a more reasonable margin for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget.

This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but allows me to stay within my budget.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer from this point. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
