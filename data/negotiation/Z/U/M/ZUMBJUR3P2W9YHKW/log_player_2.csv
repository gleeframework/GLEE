"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, potentially leading to a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget.  Since Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, and John offers the product for $8,000, it is in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John."
