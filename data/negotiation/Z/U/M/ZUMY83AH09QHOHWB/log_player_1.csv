Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** It leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both of you. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price leaves some room for negotiation without appearing overly aggressive or unrealistic.

By starting with this offer, you open the negotiation process and see if Bob is willing to meet your price or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. It's worth pursuing further negotiation with Bob, seeing if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer to $1,100,000. This shows good faith and indicates I'm serious about selling to Bob, but still allows for some room for potential compromise. It's a fair offer that hopefully encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to come up much further, and this offer is very close to what John is offering.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get me much closer to my ideal price, and it's time to minimize my losses.  While I would prefer to get closer to $1,100,000, it's more important to secure the sale and make a profit than to continue to risk a deal falling through."
