This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of reaching a deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'd like to make a deal, $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to send a counteroffer."

While I appreciate Bob's effort to meet halfway, $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to send a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
