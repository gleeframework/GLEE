"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product worth $1,000,000 at a significant discount. We look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while saving $50,000. There's no guarantee you can negotiate a better price, and going to John would mean paying your full budget."
