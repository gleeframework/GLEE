"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is too high.  While the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, there's a good chance I can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do  $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is slightly below my maximum budget. This gives me some flexibility to negotiate upwards if needed, while still staying within my limits.
* **Respectful Tone:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone throughout the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but $1,000,000 is still too high. It's important to show I'm serious about a lower price and willing to walk away if necessary. I'll make another counteroffer closer to my maximum, but I need to be prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,000,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to be around $750,000. That's a fair offer, reflecting the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not budging significantly.
* **Firm but Fair:** My language suggests this is a serious offer and close to my limit. 
* **Deadline Implied:** I haven't explicitly threatened to go with John, but the clock is ticking. Alice needs to realize I have other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not negotiating seriously. She dropped her price by a mere $50,000, indicating she's not truly willing to meet near my budget. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result than my alternative option.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the most rational choice, as it ensures I get the product without overpaying."
