Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $750,000, reflecting a premium offer just for you.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high floor:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, so she shouldn't go below that.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** Offering the product just below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) creates a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Time pressure:**  The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Why this approach makes sense:**

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. If Bob accepts, Alice gets a better price than her minimum. If he declines, she doesn't lose anything and can proceed with the guaranteed sale to John."
