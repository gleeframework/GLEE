Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves him room to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Bob is somewhat open to negotiation. If you know Bob to be extremely price-sensitive, you might need to start lower.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might offer a slightly more appealing price."
