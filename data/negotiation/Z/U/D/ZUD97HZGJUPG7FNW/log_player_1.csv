{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,800,000.  This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value and potential to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I invite Bob to share his thoughts, implying a willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation. By starting high, I can potentially extract a higher price from Bob. However, if he rejects, I can lower the price gradually, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price.  

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. The success of this negotiation depends on Bob's response and subsequent counteroffers. It's crucial to be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is a fair offer considering my budget and the fact that I could buy the same product from John for that price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Even though I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer that is higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This will show that I am willing to negotiate but still want a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While $1,000,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the unique value of this product and would be a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I begin by showing appreciation for Bob's interest and acknowledging his offer, even though it's too low.
* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:** I'm offering $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's offer but still significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I remind Bob about the unique value of the product, reinforcing the justification for the price.
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I frame the counteroffer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and mutual benefit. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  Reduce the difference between our price expectations.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Keep my price above my minimum acceptable price while showing flexibility.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  By suggesting a meeting in the middle, I invite Bob to counter again.

**Next Steps:**

The next round will depend on Bob's response. If he accepts, I've secured a profitable sale. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget. If we can agree on this, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Bob.  
* **Secure the sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at my minimum acceptable price, avoiding any risk of rejection or a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might reject and stick with John's offer.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at my minimum, which is a good outcome considering the potential risks."
