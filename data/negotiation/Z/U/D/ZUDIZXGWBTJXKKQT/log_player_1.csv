Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're both trying to find a good middle ground. While I appreciate the move to $920,000, it's still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference and aim for $900,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. What do you say?
