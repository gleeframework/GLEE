Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price and even lower than my guaranteed value from John.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my guaranteed $800,000 from John.  To avoid further risk of a lower offer or prolonged negotiations, I'm going to sell to John for the guaranteed amount."
