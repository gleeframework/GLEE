"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product holds for you. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $900,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $925,000 is my final offer.  Let's make this happen.  ",925000.0,Alice,5,
