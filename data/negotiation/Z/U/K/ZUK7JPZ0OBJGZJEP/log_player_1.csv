Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential return on investment to justify the high asking price. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving the door open for negotiation if he finds the initial price too high. 

**Goal:** The ideal outcome is for Bob to accept the $2,000,000 offer. However, even if he negotiates down, you're still in a strong position with your fallback option of selling to John."
