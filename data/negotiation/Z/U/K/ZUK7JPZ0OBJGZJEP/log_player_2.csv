"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $2,000,000, which is $500,000 more than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, which is a much better deal.
