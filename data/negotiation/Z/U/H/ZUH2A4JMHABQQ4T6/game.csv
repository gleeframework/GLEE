"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $100?  Let's see if we can make this work.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
