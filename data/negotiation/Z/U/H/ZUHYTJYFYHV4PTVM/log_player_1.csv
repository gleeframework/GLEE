Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we don't want to start there. It's always better to begin negotiations with a higher price, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price somewhat.
* **Alternative:**  We have a safety net: John is willing to pay $15,000.  This gives Alice leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always counter with a lower price, gradually moving closer to his perceived value while staying above her minimum. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation with Bob."
