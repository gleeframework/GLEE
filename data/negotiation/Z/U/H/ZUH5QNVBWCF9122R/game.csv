"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the price I've seen it for elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll give you a deal at $155, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",155.0,Alice,5,
