""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it provides significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It shows you're willing to work with him.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have John as a safety net, ensuring we won't go below $15,000.

This offer balances getting the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging he has a lower perceived value."
