``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures I still get a good price."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm still aiming to get the best price possible. I'm going slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while staying firm on my desired price range."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not yet ready to accept less than $13,500, and I'll see if I can push for that price in the next round."

```

I'm sticking to my previous offer of $13,500. I've made concessions, and I'm confident that this is a fair price. I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob this round, but I'm also prepared to potentially sell to John if necessary."

```

I'm still trying to get the best possible price. I'm making a small concession by dropping my offer to $13,400.  This shows flexibility while still remaining close to my target price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $13,350 for the product. This is my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,350.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  While Bob's offer of $13,350 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $13,500.  We've reached round 8, leaving only 2 rounds left.  I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal with John, especially since he's willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. 

Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome at this point.  It's a difficult decision, but a necessary one to ensure I get the most value for my product."
