I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to secure a good deal.  I'm confident in the product's worth and believe Bob will be motivated to negotiate."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $850,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can convince Bob to come up slightly higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still ensures I get a good price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $825,000 is still better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
