"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
