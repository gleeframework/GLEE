"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price. To be fair, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and I can't go as low as $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
