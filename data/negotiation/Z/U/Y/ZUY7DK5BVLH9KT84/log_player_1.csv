Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum value, which is important.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear signal:** This shows that you're serious about selling and sets the stage for a potential negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it, it's important to remember that you can still get a better price.  You can counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,375? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is very close to your minimum acceptable price, and it's higher than what John is offering. It's a good deal for you, so it's best to accept it."
