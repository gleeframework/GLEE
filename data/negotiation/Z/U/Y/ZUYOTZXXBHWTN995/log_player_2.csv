"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob wants to pay as little as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still more than Bob's maximum.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob aims for the lowest possible price within his budget.  $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer.
* **Showing Interest:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest while still stating his price point. This keeps the negotiation open and avoids an abrupt rejection. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's room for Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, leading to a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:** $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly willing to compromise, and a counteroffer might lead to a price closer to Bob's desired range.
* **John as a safety net:**  If negotiations with Alice fall through, Bob can still buy from John for $8,000, providing a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit high at $9,500.  Would you consider $9,000? That's closer to my budget and might make the deal possible."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget.
* **Emphasis on Budget:**  The message highlights Bob's budget constraints to encourage further compromise from Alice.
* **Positive Framing:** The language is positive (""might make the deal possible"") to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This is a good compromise that leaves us both happy.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** $9,250 remains above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to compromise, indicating further room for a price closer to Bob's desired range. 
* **John as a fallback:** Bob still has the option to buy from John at $8,000 if negotiations with Alice fail. 
* **Minimizing losses:**  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially achieve a better price than the current offer without committing to an out-of-budget purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,125?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob is offering a price that's exactly halfway between his previous offer ($9,000) and Alice's current offer ($9,250). This demonstrates a clear commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Fairness appeal:** Bob emphasizes the fairness of the offer, suggesting it benefits both parties. 
* **Staying within budget:**  While $9,125 is close to Bob's limit, it's still within his budget and leaves some room for potential future adjustments.
* **Keeping the negotiation alive:** By offering a counterproposal, Bob shows he's still interested in the deal and willing to negotiate further."
