"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're suggesting is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
