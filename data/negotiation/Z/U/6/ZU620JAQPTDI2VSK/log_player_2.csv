# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. We believe it offers immense value and could significantly benefit your endeavors. Considering its worth to us and its potential impact on your business, we are offering it to you for $950,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at an advantageous price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $950,000 is still more than his maximum budget of $800,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

We believe in the value of our product and would like to propose a price of $900,000. We hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product.

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get the price down further. There's still room for compromise, and buying from John is still a viable option if the negotiation fails."

Let's finalize this deal, as I'm confident this price is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
