"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [product description] for a price of $2000000. This is a significant investment, but I believe its value will far exceed your expectations.  Let's discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value of [product description], and I believe it's a mutually beneficial solution.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in making this deal work.  Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within a specific budget.  $900000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price point.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1000000. This reflects the value of [product description] and provides a fair compromise.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to making this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and a reasonable price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $950000 is still too far below what the product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $975000.  This is a significant concession, and it's the last offer I can make. Let's seal this deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $975000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $960000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and reflects both of our needs.  Let's come to an agreement on this final offer.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your persistence. While $960000 is still lower than my desired price point, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $965000. This reflects the true value of [product description] and offers a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",965000.0,Alice,9,
