"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $130 for the product.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you the product for $160. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $160 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $140? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $155. It's the lowest I can go while still making a decent profit, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
