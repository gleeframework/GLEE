Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,050,000, I believe I can get a better price. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if necessary. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Considering the potential for this product to add value to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget constraints, could you consider $1,075,000 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of this deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1087500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my financial situation, could you consider $1,080,000 as a reasonable price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's not the ideal price, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,080,000.  It's a decent profit for me, and we've reached an agreement.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal completely, and I'm not sure I can get a better price with Bob or John at this point."
