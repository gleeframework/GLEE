"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $250?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $250 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be open to that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, and I think that's a fair price considering my budget.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $160?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget here.  $160 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",150.0,Bob,6,
