"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a little further.  I'll accept $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,
