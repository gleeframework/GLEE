"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I can't go lower than $8,000. This is already below my minimum desired price, but I'm willing to make this concession for a quick sale. If you're serious about buying, let me know if you can meet me at this price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
