"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at such a large loss.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal, but I'm keeping the option to sell to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I am still open to selling to John, as he is offering my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I can't go lower than $8,000. This is already below my minimum desired price, but I'm willing to make this concession for a quick sale. If you're serious about buying, let me know if you can meet me at this price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
