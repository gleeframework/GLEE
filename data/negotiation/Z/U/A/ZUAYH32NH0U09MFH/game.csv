"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,300,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  I'm ready to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point considering my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing your product, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've both discussed.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're still pretty far apart on price. I'm willing to accept $1,750,000  to find a compromise, but I need you to meet me closer to that number.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand we're not quite there yet.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
