"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the conversation at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and start counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,300,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  I'm ready to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still far too high.  It's time to keep counter-offering and try to push her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing your product, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've both discussed."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're still pretty far apart on price. I'm willing to accept $1,750,000  to find a compromise, but I need you to meet me closer to that number. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice is still well above your budget.  It's worth seeing if you can push her down further before considering John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're not quite there yet.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
