{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, you can potentially save even more by negotiating. It's worth exploring the possibility of a lower price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good price.  A $50,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm confident that I can still get a better price than John's offer, but I want to make sure Alice knows that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't come down enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get the price down further. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $710,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to get Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to continue negotiating, Alice's offer of $720,000 is very close to my target price. It's a much better deal than buying from John, and the potential savings from further negotiation are likely not worth the risk of Alice rejecting my offer again."
