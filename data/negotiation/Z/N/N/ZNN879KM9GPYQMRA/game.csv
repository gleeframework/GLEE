"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that be workable?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I get a decent profit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,5,
