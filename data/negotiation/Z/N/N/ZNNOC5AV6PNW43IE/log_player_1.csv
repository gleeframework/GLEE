Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, I'm still firm on $8,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $8000. How about we try $7800? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price of $8,000. While $7,800 is close, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk going lower.  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I get my desired value and avoids further negotiation."
