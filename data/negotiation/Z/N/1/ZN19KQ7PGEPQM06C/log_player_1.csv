Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. However, I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to risk a further negotiation, as I could simply sell to John for the same price."
