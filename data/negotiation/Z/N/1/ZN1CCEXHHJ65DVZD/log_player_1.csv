Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing I have a backup buyer in John. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, or simply walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, and I have a guaranteed sale with John for the same price. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the sale."
