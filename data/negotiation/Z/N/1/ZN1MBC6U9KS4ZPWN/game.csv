"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which reflects a fair compromise between our desired prices. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial counteroffer. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

I hope this helps us move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
