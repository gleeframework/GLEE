"Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that 1050000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at 1250000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1250000 is still too high. I'm prepared to pay $1100000.  Let's aim for a deal that's fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 1100000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession to get a deal done. However, I need to ensure I'm not giving away too much value. How about we meet at 1300000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1150000.  This would allow us to both reach a fair compromise and close this deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground here.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to get a deal done. However, I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about we aim for 1275000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1275000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1275000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm willing to offer $1200000.  This would allow us to both reach a fair compromise and close this deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. Let's try to meet at 1250000 one last time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
