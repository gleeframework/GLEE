"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's in the middle ground. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $900,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000 to try and reach a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'd like to counteroffer at $950,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
