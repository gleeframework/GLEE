Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $19,000.  I believe in its value, but I'm also realistic about market demand. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 19000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, Room to Negotiate:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value provides room for negotiation. This gives the impression the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thought.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's seriousness.  If he's immediately turned off, you haven't lost anything. You have a guaranteed sale with John at $10,000.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  Odd pricing like $19,000 can sometimes be more appealing than a round number like $20,000. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is extremely price-sensitive, you might lower your initial offer slightly. However, starting high always gives you the option to come down.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** How comfortable are you with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer? If you're highly risk-averse, you might start with a lower offer closer to $15,000."
