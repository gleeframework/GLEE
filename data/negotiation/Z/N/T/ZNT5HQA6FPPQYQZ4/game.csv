"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum limit.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15000. This is a compromise that I think is still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $13500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $14500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
