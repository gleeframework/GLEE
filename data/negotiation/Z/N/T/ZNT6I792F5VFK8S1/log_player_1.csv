"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to capture a good chunk of the value difference. I'm confident Bob will want the product, but I'm leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $13,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000. It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it will entice Bob to accept. We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $13,500 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my goal.  While I could potentially get more, I'm worried that if I reject, Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck with the lower price from John.  It's time to take the deal."
