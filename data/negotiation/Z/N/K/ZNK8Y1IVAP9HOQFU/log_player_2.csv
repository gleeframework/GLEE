Considering its high quality and the benefits it brings, I believe we can come to an agreement that respects both our interests. To make this opportunity more appealing, I am offering the product to you at a special introductory price of $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to respond promptly. Looking forward to your positive response.
