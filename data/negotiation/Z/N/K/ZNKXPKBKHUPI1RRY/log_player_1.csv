Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer, as he stands to gain $100,000.
* **It's a strong opening position:** By offering a high price, you establish a firm stance and control the negotiation.

However, be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, you'll need to weigh his counteroffer against the potential of selling to John for $1,000,000."
