"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000, and it's a bit higher than your original offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
