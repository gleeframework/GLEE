{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120. This is a decent starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above the product's value to her. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price. Although we're getting closer, I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as his price is higher than what I'm willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting increasingly unfavorable. With only 3 rounds left, the chance of getting a lower price is slim. It's now more advantageous to buy from John for $150. While not ideal, it's a guaranteed purchase, and we're running out of time to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
