"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $9000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that 9000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer you a deal for 8800. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8800 is getting closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm firm on $8300 for the product.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8300.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 8300. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer 8600. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
