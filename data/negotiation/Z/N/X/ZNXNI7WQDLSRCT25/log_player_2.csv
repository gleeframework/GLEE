It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000 when you can get it from John for $10,000.  A counteroffer is the best option to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price that's still a fair deal for her, while also saving me some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to go with John's offer of $10,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a better price."
