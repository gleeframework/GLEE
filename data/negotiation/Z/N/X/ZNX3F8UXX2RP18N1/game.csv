"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $120 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $100? I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement, as I'm very interested in this product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100, which is $110. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which is $102.50. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",102.5,Alice,7,
