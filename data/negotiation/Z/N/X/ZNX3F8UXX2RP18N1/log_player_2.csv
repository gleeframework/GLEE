# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high, exceeding your budget by $100.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can get a better deal through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is closer to your budget, it's still $40 more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you've already established a lower price point that you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $120 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $100? I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement, as I'm very interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100, which is $110. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, it's still $30 over your limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate since you're only halfway through the rounds. You can still try to push for a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which is $102.50. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $102.5 is closer to your budget, it's still $22.50 over your limit. With only three rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better deal from Alice are diminishing. It's wiser to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring you stay within your budget and avoid further negotiation."
