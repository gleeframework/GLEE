"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to stay closer to $10,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We understand your budget considerations and are willing to accommodate your request. However, given the cost of production and the value of the product, we cannot lower the price further than our initial offer. Therefore, we are proposing a revised offer of $11,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the market value, and we hope it meets your requirements.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
