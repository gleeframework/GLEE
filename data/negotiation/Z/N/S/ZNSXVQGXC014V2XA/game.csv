"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this price, of course, but I'm confident in its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and we're getting closer. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,425,000? This feels like a fair deal to me.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
