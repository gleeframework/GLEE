"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $750000 is a fair price, but I believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
