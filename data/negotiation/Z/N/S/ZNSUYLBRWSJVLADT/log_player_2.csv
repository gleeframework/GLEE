"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. While her offer is time-sensitive, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at a price that fits your budget.  It makes sense to see if Alice will come down further in price."
