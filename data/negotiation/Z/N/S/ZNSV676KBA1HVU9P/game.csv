"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. ",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,050,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is a fair and reasonable offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value to me and your own profit margin. I hope you'll reconsider.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a bit above my minimum, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
