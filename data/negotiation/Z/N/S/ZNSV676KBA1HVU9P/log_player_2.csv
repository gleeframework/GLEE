Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,050,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is a fair and reasonable offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, you can still potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate. You are looking to pay as little as possible, and you can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value to me and your own profit margin. I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a bit above my minimum, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is a good compromise. You've managed to negotiate a price significantly lower than her initial offer and significantly lower than John's price. While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice walking away from the deal, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids any further negotiation risk."
