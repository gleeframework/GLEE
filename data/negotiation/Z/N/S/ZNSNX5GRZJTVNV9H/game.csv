"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",7500.0,Bob,4,
