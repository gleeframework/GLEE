{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but still allowing me to make a decent profit. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation,  $6,000 is too far off. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is still lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating, but there's always a risk that Bob will walk away.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but $7,500 is still a good deal and I'm happy to take it."
