"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $18000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16500? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make an exception for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll consider it a great deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $15000? It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",15000.0,Alice,7,
