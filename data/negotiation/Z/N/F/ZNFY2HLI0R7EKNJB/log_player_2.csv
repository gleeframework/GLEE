"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I propose a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high, considering her product's value to her is significantly lower. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $9,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, it's a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about buying but want a fair price. It leaves space for Alice to counter and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate. Starting low allows for more back-and-forth."
