"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I propose a price of $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While $9,000 is lower than I hoped for, it's still a significant profit.
