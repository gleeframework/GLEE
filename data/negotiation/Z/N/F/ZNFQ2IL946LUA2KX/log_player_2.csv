You can do better than $95. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

I'm offering $85 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $80 to Alice."

You can still get a better price than $90.  Rejecting Alice's offer again allows you to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}

I'm going to offer $88.  It's a compromise between our previous offers and still a good price for both of us."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

```

Alice is not budging much, and you've already had a few rounds of counteroffers.  At this point, it's better to just buy from John for $100. You're not saving much more with Alice and you're risking getting stuck in an endless cycle of negotiation."
