"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000.  Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $1,175,000 is still too low.  I'm offering $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
