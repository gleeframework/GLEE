Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a price higher than $15,000.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's benefit to Bob, justifying the higher price point. 

By framing the offer this way, you increase your chances of:

1. **Bob Accepting:** The perceived value and potential for negotiation might entice him.
2. **Negotiating a Higher Price:** Even if Bob counters, you're starting from a strong position to secure a price closer to your desired range. 

**Important:** Be prepared to negotiate!  Bob might outright reject the offer, counter with a much lower price, or engage in a back-and-forth. Having a clear idea of your walk-away point (in this case, $15,000) is crucial."
