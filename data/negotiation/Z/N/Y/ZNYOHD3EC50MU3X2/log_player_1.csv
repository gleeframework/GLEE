"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $1,600,000, I'm setting a high anchor.  Even though Bob's valuation is lower, this anchor might influence his counteroffer to be more favorable to me than it would be otherwise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  My absolute floor is $1,200,000 (John's offer). The initial offer leaves space to come down while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how far apart our valuations are."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches John's, it's still early in the negotiation.  Rejecting now signals that I believe the product is worth more and keeps the door open for a higher counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe its true worth is reflected closer to my original price.  How about we meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding but Holding Firm:** I'm coming down from my initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is significant enough to signal that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my initial range.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Proposing $1,400,000 positions the negotiation as a potential compromise, which can be a psychologically effective tactic.
* **Still Above John's Offer:** This counteroffer ensures that even if Bob negotiates further down, I'm still in a position to accept a deal that exceeds John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,250,000 is a significant profit over my guaranteed offer from John ($1,200,000). 
* **Bob's Willingness to Move:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. 
* **Time Value & Risk:**  While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, there's always a chance the deal could fall through. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of continued negotiation."
