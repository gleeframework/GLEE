"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $130 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $140. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $155. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
