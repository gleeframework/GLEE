"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider the value this product brings to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $750000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $700000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. ",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $725000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I'm getting a decent return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $725000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
