"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
