Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Your Limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($1,500,000), giving you a strong position to negotiate from. 
* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** The offer of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It also ensures you're aiming for a profit above your minimum.
* **Open for Discussion:** The tone is collaborative rather than demanding.  By asking for Bob's thoughts, you invite him to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to find a price that benefits both parties if possible while ensuring you don't undervalue your product."
