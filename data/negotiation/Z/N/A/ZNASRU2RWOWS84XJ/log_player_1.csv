"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately signal I'm desperate to sell.
* **Focus on value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more receptive to the price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm explicitly open to discussion, letting Bob know that the price isn't set in stone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more agreeable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.
* **Not desperate:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can maximize my profits through continued negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's potential, and it gives us both a chance to close the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget limitations but emphasizing my own minimum acceptable price.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how this price represents a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive, emphasizing collaboration and a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. There's still room to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Balancing risk:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, but I'm not desperate to close the deal.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However,  $900,000 is still not enough.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while keeping the deal within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's offer of $900,000 and my previous offer of $1,050,000.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message highlights that this price is a fair compromise,  beneficial for both parties.
* **Reinforcing negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm still willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and we're getting closer to a deal. I'm hoping you'll reconsider and accept this offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has again increased his offer, $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:** With only four rounds left, the negotiation window is shrinking, and Bob is not moving significantly closer to my price point.
* **Weighing risk and reward:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming increasingly appealing, as it guarantees a secure outcome. Continuing with Bob risks losing the opportunity to sell to John.  

**Reasoning:** While I'm still open to negotiations, the risk of not reaching an acceptable price with Bob is outweighing the potential gains.  With only a few rounds left, it's time to consider the guaranteed value of selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing hard, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, I need to be realistic about my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a substantial drop from my previous offer, and a final chance for us to close this deal.  It's up to you now."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop, putting me very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's meant to be a final offer, signaling that further negotiations are unlikely. 
* **Emphasis on realism:** I'm emphasizing my minimum price point to convey my seriousness about closing the deal, but also the limits of my flexibility.
* **Shifting the burden:** The message places the responsibility on Bob to make a decision, as it suggests this is the final chance to reach an agreement.
* **Negotiation risk vs. reward:**  While I'm willing to come down further, I'm also aware that time is running out. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll need to make a decisive decision about selling to John."
