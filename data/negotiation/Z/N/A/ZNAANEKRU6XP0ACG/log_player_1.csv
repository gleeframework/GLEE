"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming to maximize profit, so we start with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $1,300,000 offer allows space for Bob to negotiate down while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** We want to establish a positive tone for the negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is above our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than both our initial offer and Bob's perceived value. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. We are early in the negotiation, so selling to John for $800,000 is not yet the most strategic option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to both parties.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We reiterate the product's worth to reinforce its higher price point.
* **Positive Framing:** By positioning the counteroffer as a compromise (""meeting in the middle""), we aim to keep the negotiation collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates he is motivated to purchase. We are likely to secure a better deal if we continue negotiating. 
* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $1,025,000 is a significant improvement from his initial offer, it's still below our target. We have six rounds remaining, and John's offer isn't time-sensitive, so we have the leverage to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. To show my commitment, let's settle on $1,100,000. This price feels fair considering its value and potential for your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($50,000) to signal that we're nearing our desired price point, while still leaving room for a final agreement. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** We continue to highlight the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Creating Urgency (Subtly):** By stating that this price ""feels fair,"" we subtly imply that our willingness to negotiate further might be limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are getting close to a deal.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,050,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum ($800,000). 
* **Deal Momentum Slowing:** Bob's offer increases are getting smaller. While we might be able to push for a bit more, the potential gains are less certain.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the earnings sooner, potentially generating additional returns.

While we might be able to secure a slightly higher price with further negotiation, the current offer represents a favorable balance of profit, risk, and the time value of money."
