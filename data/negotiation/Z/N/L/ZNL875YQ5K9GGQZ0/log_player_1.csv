Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm meeting Bob halfway again, offering $950,000, hoping to close the deal before I'm forced to sell to John. This price ensures I get a significant profit, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of losing the deal."
