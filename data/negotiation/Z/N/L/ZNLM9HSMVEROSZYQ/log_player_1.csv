Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum asking price of $120.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 107.50}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's as low as I can go.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm starting to think about buying from another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go higher than $105. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already rejected his offer twice and it seems unlikely he'll budge further.  I'm better off selling to John at this point and getting the guaranteed $120."
