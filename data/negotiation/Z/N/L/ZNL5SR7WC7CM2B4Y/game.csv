"Thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay, which is $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
