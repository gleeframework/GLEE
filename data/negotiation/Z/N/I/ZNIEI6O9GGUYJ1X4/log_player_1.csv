As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
