"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while also being reasonable considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,025,000. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,075,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
