Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can potentially get more. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to raise his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's minimum. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

```

Bob seems set on his price of $10,000. While it's my minimum, I've already lost time negotiating and  I don't want to risk going back and forth further. John is a guaranteed sale for the same amount, so it makes sense to go with him and avoid any further potential delays."
