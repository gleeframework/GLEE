"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. You are willing to spend a maximum of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds great, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I've made a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on my price limit. This is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That way we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

By offering $10,250, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. It's a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, making it more likely she'll accept."
