Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

How about $11,000? This still gives you a good saving, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 11000}
