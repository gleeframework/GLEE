"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $11,000? This still gives you a good saving, and it's a price I can work with.",11000.0,Alice,3,
