"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is the absolute maximum you're willing to pay. There's no room for negotiation upwards from here. By rejecting her offer, you open the door to counter-offering with a lower price and potentially saving a significant amount of money."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more competitive price. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, which might seem aggressive. However,  it provides a strong starting point for negotiation and leaves room to move upwards while still staying well below our $1,200,000 maximum.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a lower number first, we're attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation in our favor.  Even if Alice rejects this outright, it sets a different tone for the subsequent counter-offers. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states that this is a ""starting point."" This signals to Alice that we're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, she's still significantly above her own valuation of the product. We have room to negotiate further downwards. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a better price and increase the pressure on her to make a more substantial concession."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm looking to make this purchase closer to the $900,000 mark.  Would you be willing to consider a price in that range?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** We're making it clear that we're serious about a price closer to our target range. By suggesting a specific number ($900,000), we're giving Alice a concrete point to consider without moving too drastically from our previous offer. 
* **Expressing Budget Limitations (Without Being Too Specific):**  The phrase ""comfortable with"" subtly implies a budget constraint without revealing our absolute maximum. This can encourage Alice to move closer to our desired range.
* **Maintaining a Collaborative Tone:**  We're still expressing willingness to work towards a deal that works for both parties.  The question ""Would you be willing to consider..."" invites Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer you a compromise at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While we could likely push Alice a little further, the potential savings are becoming minimal.  Here's why accepting makes sense now:

* **Significant Savings:** We've negotiated Alice down $150,000 from her initial offer. That's a 12.5% discount. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield another $25,000 - $50,000 in savings, and there's a risk Alice walks away. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Time is money. Continuing to haggle over a relatively small amount could cost us other opportunities.

By accepting at $1,050,000, we're securing a good deal and avoiding the risk of having to settle for John's offer."
