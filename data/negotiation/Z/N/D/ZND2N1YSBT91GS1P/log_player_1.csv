Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** I need to earn at least $10,000, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Potential for Profit:**  By offering $15,000, I am leaving room for potential profit. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  I am willing to take a risk, as there is a chance Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a higher price.

This offer balances the need to secure a good price with the potential to get even more."
