"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $135. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is overselling the value of the product to you. While her offer of $135 is lower than your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $150, which is still within your budget."
