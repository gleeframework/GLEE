"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the value. While $11,500 is my target, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is getting closer, but it's still a touch above what I had in mind. Would you consider $10,750? I feel that's a fair compromise and would allow me to commit today.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to see us reach a deal.  $10,750 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
