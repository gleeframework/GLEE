Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the value. While $11,500 is my target, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to see us reach a deal.  $10,750 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could try to haggle further,  $10,900 is a reasonable price and saves us $1,100 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the opportunity for this price."
