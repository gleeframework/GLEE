"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product and being open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd rather get something than nothing, selling for $10,000 would leave me with a significant loss. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. I'm also reiterating that I believe this price is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go a bit lower to $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000 yet.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can come to a better agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $10,750 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my minimum, but I don't want to go too low at this point.  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,500. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm getting tired of this back-and-forth with Bob. While I'd prefer to get a better price, it's clear that we're not going to agree.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, and it's time to move on."
