Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,500 is a decent compromise and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
