"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1000000.  This price is still fair and gives you a significant return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
