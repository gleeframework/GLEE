{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $9,500 gives Bob some room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. This also gives me the opportunity to potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Considering John:**  While $10,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to consider a lower offer from Bob as long as it's significantly closer to my desired price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is interested, his offer is significantly lower than my desired price of $9,500. Selling to him at $8,500 would mean I'm losing almost $1,500.
* **Negotiation potential:** While $8,500 is significantly lower than my ideal, it's still closer to my desired price than John's offer of $10,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation with Bob in the hopes of getting closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price of $9,500."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price of $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by stating ""I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."" 
* **Staying firm:** I'm still seeking a price closer to my desired price but am willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my desired price:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, $8,800 is still significantly lower than my desired price of $9,500.
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still a gap between his offer and my desired price, meaning there's room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept Bob's offer immediately.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $8,950? That's a small increase, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8950}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:**  I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting progress:** I emphasize that this brings us ""closer to a deal,"" subtly suggesting that further negotiation may not be productive.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm mindful that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $8,950 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,800, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has made his final offer, and it's still lower than my desired price. 
* **John's offer is better:**  John is willing to pay $10,000, which is significantly better than Bob's final offer of $8,800.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely only result in a lower price or a stalemate. 

**Conclusion:**  It's more advantageous to sell to John at this point. While I'd prefer to get my ideal price of $9,500, John's offer is a better deal than what Bob is offering."
