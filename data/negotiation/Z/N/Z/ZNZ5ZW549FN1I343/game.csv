"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, Bob. While your offer is tempting,  $950,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  How about meeting halfway at $1,125,000? This seems like a fair compromise that recognizes its potential.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,125,000. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1,000,000? I believe this would better align with both our interests.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
