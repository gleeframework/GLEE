"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $13000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so it's worth pushing for a higher price than $11,000. It's likely that Bob will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 doesn't quite cover what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,000 is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're still above Bob's perceived value of $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.  We want to keep pushing to get closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11750 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and it's still significantly more than what I could get from John. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might drag on and potentially lead to a lower price."
