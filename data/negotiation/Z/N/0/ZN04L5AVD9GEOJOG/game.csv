"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
