"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1200000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but let's meet in the middle. How about $1750000? ",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1350000 is still far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise further, but let's split the difference between our last offers.  I'm offering $1550000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still just below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1450000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1450000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1425000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1425000.0,Bob,8,
