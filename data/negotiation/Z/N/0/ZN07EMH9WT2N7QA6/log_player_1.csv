Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

This is a high price, but it leaves some room for negotiation.  It's also above the value Bob places on the product, so he has an incentive to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can lower my price slightly while still getting closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired value, I am still confident I can get closer to $1,200,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This leaves room for further negotiation, but it's also significantly higher than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my desired value, but it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John. At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Bob isn't worth it. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
