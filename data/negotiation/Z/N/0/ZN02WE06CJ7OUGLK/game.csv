"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $1,050,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. That's a fair price considering your original valuation. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
