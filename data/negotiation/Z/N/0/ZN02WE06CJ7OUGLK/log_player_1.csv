"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $1,050,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. That's a fair price considering your original valuation. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, his offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
