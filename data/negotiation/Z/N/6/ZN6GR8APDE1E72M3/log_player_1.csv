"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $10,500. How about we try $9,800? That's the best I can do at this point.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $10,150? That's a pretty compelling offer."", ""product_price"": 10150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $10,150, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we try $9,900? That's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one. Bob is very slowly increasing his offers, and I'm right on the edge of my minimum price. It's tempting to hold out for more, but...

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob might eventually go slightly higher, it's not worth the risk. I have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John. Accepting even a small loss by selling to John guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
