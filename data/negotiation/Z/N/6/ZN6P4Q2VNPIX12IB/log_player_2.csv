"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $115.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that he is serious about negotiating, but also gives Alice some room to bargain.  $115 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than John's price and gives Bob a chance to save even more money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $115. Could you do $125? It's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $125 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get it for less.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his ideal.  He's offering a compromise, suggesting a price in the middle of his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement."
