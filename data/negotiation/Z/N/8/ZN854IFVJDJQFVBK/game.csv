"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This takes into account your interest and allows for some wiggle room for us both.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet at $10,750?  This is a fair compromise that's closer to your offer, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,750. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",10500.0,Bob,6,
