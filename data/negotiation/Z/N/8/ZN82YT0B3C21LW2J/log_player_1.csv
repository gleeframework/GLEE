"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how motivated he is to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too low for me, considering my minimum value is $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, so I'm not ready to sell to him at this price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still too low. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm not yet ready to sell at this price. I'll try to push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer to Bob, and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum value, and we're running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing the deal with John guarantees I meet my minimum goal."
