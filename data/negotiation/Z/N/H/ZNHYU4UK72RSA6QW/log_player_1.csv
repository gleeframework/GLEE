"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to the value Bob places on the product.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation to see if Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price.  $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I'm hoping to get closer to $14,500.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000, which is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my desired price and is definitely above my minimum.  While I'd still prefer to get closer to $14,000, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I may risk losing Bob and ending up selling to John for a lower price."
