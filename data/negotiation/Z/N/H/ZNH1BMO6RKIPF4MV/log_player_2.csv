**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your ideal price range. 
* **Negotiation is worth exploring.**  You have room to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially saving yourself a significant amount of money."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above your desired price range.
* **Further negotiation is possible.** You can potentially push Alice down even further with another counteroffer, possibly getting closer to your target of $850,000.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** You are willing to go that route if you can't secure a better deal with Alice, but for now, negotiation is still a better option."
