{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm hoping to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than the value to Bob and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to acquire the product while still staying within my financial limits. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is close enough to my desired price.  While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, I'm risking losing the deal if I continue to reject his offers.  It's a good price, and I'm confident I can make a profit on this sale."
