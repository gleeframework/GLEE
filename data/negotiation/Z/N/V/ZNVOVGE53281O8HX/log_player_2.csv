**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is consistently meeting in the middle. While we could push for a slightly better deal, the risk of her pulling back and the difference being minimal means it's a good time to accept.  We're getting the product for significantly less than John's offer and have successfully negotiated down from Alice's initial price."
