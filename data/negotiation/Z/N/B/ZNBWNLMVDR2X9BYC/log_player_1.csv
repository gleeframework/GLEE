"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to close the deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to go through multiple rounds if necessary.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with my own.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, and see how things play out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm offering $975,000. It's a compromise between my last offer and Bob's, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to consider. I'm still aiming to get as close to my target price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push Bob further. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option, but for now, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  It's a middle ground between our last offers and I think it's a fair price.  This is getting close to my minimum and I'm ready to accept if this is his final offer.  But I'll still keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob has rejected my offer and is not willing to go higher. While I would prefer to make a profit with Bob, it's clear that he's not going to meet my minimum acceptable price.  John is a reliable buyer and offers me my desired amount. I can't afford to continue negotiating and risk losing out on a guaranteed deal."
