"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,100,000? It's still a significant savings for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. Your offer is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  To be completely honest, I'm getting closer to selling to John for $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance.  $1,050,000 is my absolute final offer. Take it or leave it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
