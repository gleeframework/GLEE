"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking for the product for $80 or less. Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to your target, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
