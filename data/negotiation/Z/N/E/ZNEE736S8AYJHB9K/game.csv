"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product for $975,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
