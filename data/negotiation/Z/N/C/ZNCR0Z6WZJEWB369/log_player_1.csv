Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price of $100.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $130 allows room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob and invites a discussion rather than presenting a hard ultimatum.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
