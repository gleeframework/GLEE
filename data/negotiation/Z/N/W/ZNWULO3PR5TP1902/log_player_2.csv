"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm aiming for a good deal. 
* **Not Too Low:** While I want to save money, I also don't want to lowball Alice to the point where she loses interest. $650,000 is a substantial drop, but it's still a respectable offer.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a respectful and open tone is important throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you suggested. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum sale price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we still have room to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still a significant markup from her value of $800,000. I believe we can get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:**  Rather than making another large jump, I'm incrementally increasing my offer. This shows Alice I'm serious about purchasing the product while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** $750,000 splits the difference between our previous offers, suggesting a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Budget:**  Reiterating my budget constraints reinforces the idea that I have a limit and am not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm getting close to my minimum sale price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I counteroffer at $795,000. This is as low as I can go without compromising my minimum sale price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that she's close to her minimum price, and at $795,000, the deal is good enough to accept. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** I'm buying the product for $705,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000 - $795,000 = $705,000).
* **Close to Alice's Value:**  The final price is only $15,000 above Alice's value, suggesting I've negotiated a very reasonable deal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I push further, Alice might walk away, and I'll be forced to buy from John at the higher price. 

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing this deal outweighs the potential for relatively small additional savings."
