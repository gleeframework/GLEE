"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you suggested. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum sale price.",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm getting close to my minimum sale price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I counteroffer at $795,000. This is as low as I can go without compromising my minimum sale price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,5,,
