"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $110. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high at $107.50.  How about we split the difference and go with $108.75?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",108.75,Alice,5,
