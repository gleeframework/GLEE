"Alice, your offer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than 1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of 1350000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still stuck at $1300000. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon. I'm ready to close the deal at this price, but I need you to come down just a bit.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this sale.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your commitment to finding a compromise, I'm still unable to go above my initial offer of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon and the fact that I have other options available. I'm confident that closing the deal at this price will benefit us both.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for 1300000.

If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1315000.0,Alice,7,
