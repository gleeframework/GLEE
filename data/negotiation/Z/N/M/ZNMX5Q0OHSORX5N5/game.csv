"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9000 for the product. This is a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to save a bit more money. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more money, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $8200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $7200. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $7200 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $8000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,
