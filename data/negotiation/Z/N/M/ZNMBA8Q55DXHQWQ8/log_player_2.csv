"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product, which I know you see significant value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice by rejecting this initial offer."
