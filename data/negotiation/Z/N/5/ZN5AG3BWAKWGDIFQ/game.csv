"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer the product for $1,300,000. This reflects the significant value this product holds for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit higher than $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is fair considering the value I'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's very close to my minimum, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This price is fair considering the product's value and allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,175,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
