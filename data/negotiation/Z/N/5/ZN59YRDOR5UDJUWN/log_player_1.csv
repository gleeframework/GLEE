Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value"" of the product aims to subtly justify the higher price.
* **Urgency:**  Implying I have other interested buyers (""listing it publicly"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  
* Observing Bob's reaction to the initial offer is crucial for deciding the next steps in the negotiation."
