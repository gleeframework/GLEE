{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $10,000.**  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **You have the opportunity to counteroffer.** This gives you a chance to get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is your last resort.**  While it's an option, it's only if you can't get a better price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and also takes into account your budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price of $10,000**. While it's closer, you're still aiming to save as much as you can. 
* **You have the opportunity to counteroffer again.** You can try to push for a price closer to your target.
* **Buying from John is still your last resort.** You're actively negotiating with Alice, so you don't want to give up on that effort just yet."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I can offer it to you for $11,250. I think that's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your last counteroffer.**  The difference is only $250.
* **You're getting closer to your target price**.  While not your ideal price, $11,250 is still a good deal considering you could pay $15,000 from John.
* **Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal.** Alice has shown she's firm at this price, and pushing further could lead to her walking away. It's a good compromise."
