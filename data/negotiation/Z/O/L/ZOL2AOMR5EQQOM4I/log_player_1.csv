Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $175. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $150 gives you a starting point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The safety net of John buying at $150 means you don't have to go below that price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There are other valid approaches, and the ""best"" offer depends on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
