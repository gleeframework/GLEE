Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net, ensuring you'll get at least $100.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming to capture most of the value difference ($50) between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum acceptable price. This leaves Bob with a small gain ($10) and maximizes your potential profit."
