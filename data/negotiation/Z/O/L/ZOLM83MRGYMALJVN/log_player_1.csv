Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Given the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to pay $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $800,000. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fall apart."

Let's keep working together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
