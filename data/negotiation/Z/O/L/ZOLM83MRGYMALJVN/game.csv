"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point, given the value we both see in this product.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Given the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to pay $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see. Let's work together to close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  While $750,000 is a good offer, it doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's keep working together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit above my budget. To make this deal work, I'm offering $800,000.  This price represents the maximum I can pay while still staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
