"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750000 is lower than what I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This represents a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal!",850000.0,Alice,3,
