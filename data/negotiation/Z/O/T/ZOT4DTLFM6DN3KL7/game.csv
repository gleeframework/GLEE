"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1275000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a profitable deal for you. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
