"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This price reflects the product's value to me and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,800. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8800.0,Alice,3,
