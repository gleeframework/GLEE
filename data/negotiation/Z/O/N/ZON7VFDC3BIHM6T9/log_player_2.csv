"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You can save at least $50,000 by rejecting the first offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

You can still save money by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer. Alice is already willing to come down in price, so there's a chance you can get it even lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $875,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

At this point, you're saving $115,000 by accepting Alice's offer, which is a significant amount. While you could potentially keep negotiating, there's no guarantee that you'll get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to take the guaranteed savings and secure the product."
