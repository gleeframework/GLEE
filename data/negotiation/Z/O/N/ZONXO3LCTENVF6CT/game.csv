"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. How about $1,500,000? This would allow us both to close the deal and get the transaction completed.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
