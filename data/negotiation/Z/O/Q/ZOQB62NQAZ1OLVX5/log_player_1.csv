Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving Bob room to negotiate.  However, it's still below the estimated $1,500,000 value to him, potentially incentivizing him to accept. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low. While it's better than John's offer, I can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  I'll aim for a higher price than Bob's offer but remain open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is still below Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000 but significantly higher than his offer of $1,350,000. This approach aims to show a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle yet.  His offer is still below my ideal target, and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while also being significantly better than Bob's last offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as his offer is close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is only slightly higher than John's offer, and I've already made several concessions.  I'm not confident I can push for a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk further delays. It's time to accept John's offer and secure a deal."
