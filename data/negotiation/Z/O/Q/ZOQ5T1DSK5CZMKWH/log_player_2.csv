"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal compared to John's $120, you can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Since you are willing to pay up to $120, you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than $90, you are still willing to pay up to $120.  You can likely get a better price with another counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $88?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go below $90. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount. How about we meet at $91? It's a fair price that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $91 is a good compromise. It's still a significant saving compared to John's $120, and you're likely to get a better deal than if you keep negotiating.  There's a good chance that further negotiation would only result in a small price drop, and it's not worth the time and effort."
