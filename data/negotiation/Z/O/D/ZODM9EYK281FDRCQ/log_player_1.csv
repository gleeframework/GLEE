"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. Let's split the difference.

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your offer and appreciate the back and forth. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's go with $890,000.  This is a very fair price, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us.  I'm ready to close if you're on board."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we could reach a compromise. I would like to propose a final price of $885,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with the price, it's only $5,000 less than my last counteroffer. I'm running out of rounds, and selling to John would be significantly lower. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
