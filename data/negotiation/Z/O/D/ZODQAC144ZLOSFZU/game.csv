"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget allows. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my financial constraints and the product's value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, which reflects a fair value for the product considering my needs. This is my final offer. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While your offer is appreciated, I can't accept anything less than $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
