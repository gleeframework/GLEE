Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product. Given its significant value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair opportunity for you to gain ownership while reflecting its worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Your Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above Bob's perceived value, maximizing potential profit while ensuring you get more than John's offer if Bob accepts.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""significant value"" and calling it a ""fair opportunity"" adds a touch of persuasion without revealing your bottom line. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to secure a deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
