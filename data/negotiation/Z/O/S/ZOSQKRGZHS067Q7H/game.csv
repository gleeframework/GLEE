"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While I can't quite meet your offer of $1,300,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,325,000. Can we meet in the middle this time?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm always willing to find common ground. While I can't go as low as $1,325,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $1,337,500. This feels like a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",1337500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'll propose $1,325,000 again. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
