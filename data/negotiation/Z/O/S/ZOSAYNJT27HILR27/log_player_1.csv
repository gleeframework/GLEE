Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, it's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Above John's Offer:**  We know John will pay $150, so we want to aim higher than that to maximize potential earnings.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $170, we give Bob the opportunity to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can then decide whether to accept, counter again, or stick to our original price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
