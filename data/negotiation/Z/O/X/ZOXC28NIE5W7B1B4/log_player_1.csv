Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit.
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a price of $120, you're setting an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely the final price will be closer to $120 than if you started at $90.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a backup buyer who will pay your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:**  While you know Bob values the product at $80, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. Gauge his interest and adjust your approach accordingly.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy in mind for how low you're willing to go."
