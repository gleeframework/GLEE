"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you and the initial offer I made. I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
