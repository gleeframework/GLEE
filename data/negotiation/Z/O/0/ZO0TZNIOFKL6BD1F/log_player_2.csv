"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $175. This is too high, so you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  Thanks for your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $125?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice's counteroffer of $125 is within your budget and likely closer to her minimum price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
