Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language (""great product"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, which allows him to respond and potentially start a dialogue. 

This strategy gives me the best chance of getting a good price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.  
* **John as a backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  Thanks for your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $125?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the higher price.
* **Positive and open-ended:** The message is positive and ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond.

This counteroffer allows me to explore a compromise while keeping the negotiation open and maintaining my position."
