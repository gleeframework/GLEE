{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, you want to see if you can get closer to the product's true value to you. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** $110 offers a $30 profit margin, which is a significant increase over selling to John.
* **Enticing to Bob:**  The price is still below Bob's perceived value ($80), making it more likely he'll accept. 

By starting with a strong offer, you increase your chances of a quick and profitable sale to Bob."
