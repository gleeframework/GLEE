"Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
