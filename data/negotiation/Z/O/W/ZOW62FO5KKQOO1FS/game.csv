"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to come down, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make this work, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free setup and training session, which is a $500 value. So, the total package would be $9,000 for the product and the extras. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",9000.0,Alice,7,
