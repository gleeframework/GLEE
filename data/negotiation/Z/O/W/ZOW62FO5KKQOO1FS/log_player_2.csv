{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to buy from Alice at $12,000.  You can do much better. Let's see what counteroffers we can get."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is better than $12,000, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,000 is still a little too high, but we're getting closer.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can get to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to come down, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make this work, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free setup and training session, which is a $500 value. So, the total package would be $9,000 for the product and the extras. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While the extras are tempting, $9,000 is still outside my budget, and I'm worried the negotiation will continue to drag on. I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000 to avoid further delays and ensure I get the product within my budget."
