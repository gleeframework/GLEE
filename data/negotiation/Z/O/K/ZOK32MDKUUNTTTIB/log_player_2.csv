"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still a significant amount more than the product's value to Alice ($800,000).  There's room to negotiate further and try to get a better price.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting the initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially getting a lower price. If Alice is motivated to sell, she may be willing to meet you somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $900,000, but still higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). This shows that you are serious about buying the product, but you are also looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above the product's value to her and significantly higher than your desired price.  There's still room to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a slight increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. It is still lower than Alice's current offer, but closer to the middle ground. This encourages Alice to consider accepting, as it is closer to her desired price while still being a good deal for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is still a significant price, it's becoming increasingly clear that Alice is not going to budge much further.  Continuing to negotiate might result in more rounds and time wasted without a guarantee of a significantly lower price. Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be much more costly.  

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic decision. It secures the product at a price that is still within your budget and represents a reasonable compromise."
