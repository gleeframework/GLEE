Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price significantly higher than your $10,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price.
* **Gauge Interest:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond, providing insight into how interested he is and giving Alice room to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to adjust her price based on Bob's reaction and potential counteroffers."
