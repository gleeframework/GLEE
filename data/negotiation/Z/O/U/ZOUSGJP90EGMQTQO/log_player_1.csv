Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise and potentially reach a higher price. I'm also using positive language to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This still leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $15,500?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $15,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly higher price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I understand your budget, but $16,000 is my absolute lowest offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I have a few more rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
