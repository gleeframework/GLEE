Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling to him, $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1025000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and a reasonable deal considering his value for the product. I'll accept his offer."
