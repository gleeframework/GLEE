"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to go up to $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?  This would allow me to purchase the product while still staying within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,750, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we do $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my target price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
