"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $180 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer, but I'm confident that I can negotiate down from there.  I'm hoping to find a price that's still profitable for me, but also attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, even though it's better than nothing. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $60 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but how about $130? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$90 is still too low for me, considering my minimum price is $150.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 just won't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $110 is closer, but still a little high for me. What if I offered $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just isn't going to work for me. Let's meet in the middle once more. If you're willing to go to $105, I'm ready to close the deal. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
