{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** By starting at $1,000,000, you give yourself room to negotiate down without sacrificing too much profit.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob increases his likelihood of accepting a higher price. 
* **Maintain flexibility:**  Be prepared to counter Bob's offers if needed, but remember you have a fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and my budget. Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price. I want to maximize my profit and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still keeps the price closer to my desired range.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but reiterate that it's too low. I emphasize the value of the product to Bob and express a willingness to find a middle ground.

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By reducing the price slightly from the initial offer, I'm showing flexibility. However, I'm not giving away too much.
* **Value Focus:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob increases the likelihood that he'll accept a higher price.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still prepared to reject further low offers and potentially sell to John for $1,200,000."
