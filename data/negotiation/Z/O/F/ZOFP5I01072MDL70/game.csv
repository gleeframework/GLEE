"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly unique.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the inherent worth of what's being offered. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me to justify. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I believe that's a fair offer for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
