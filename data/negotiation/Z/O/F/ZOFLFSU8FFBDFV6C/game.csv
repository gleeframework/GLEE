,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,95.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can do $95, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $95 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement!",92.5,Bob,4,,

"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob! I appreciate the effort. I can do $97.50, which is a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for this great product. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy.",95.0,Bob,6,,
