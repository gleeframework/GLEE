Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still getting me closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to start the negotiation on a good footing. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counteroffer or move on to John. 
* **Counteroffers:**  If Bob counters, I'll need to assess the offer and decide if it's acceptable or if I should counter again. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing that John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a solid baseline and allows me to be more firm in my negotiations with Bob."
