Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and the attractiveness of the deal. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  By asking Bob what he thinks, I signal that I'm open to a counteroffer if he finds my price too high. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can then consider John's offer of $120, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm closer to my minimum acceptable value of $120 than Bob is to his maximum value of $80.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round. This shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to hold out for a better price. 
* **Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John for $120, guaranteeing me my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is tempting, it's still a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes the idea of a ""fair deal"" for both parties, making the offer more appealing.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's maximum value of $80, so I have room to negotiate further if needed. 
* **Safety Net:**  As before, selling to John for $120 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. Would you be willing to consider $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $95 is just $5 away from my previous counteroffer of $100, and it's significantly closer to my minimum acceptable value of $120 than Bob's previous offer of $90. 
* **Potential for Closing the Deal:**  Bob has indicated this is his highest offer, and I'm not confident I can push for a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiations.
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation could take time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a higher price. Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing or a lower price. 
* **Safety Net:**  While I'm not getting my ideal price, I can always rely on John's offer of $120 as a fallback option if the deal with Bob falls through in the future."
