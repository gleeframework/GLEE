"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  $1,200,000 is too high for Bob's budget. There is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
``` 

This offer is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. It leaves room for Alice to counter if she desires, but it also shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is still within Bob's budget, it's too close to his limit and Alice is clearly not willing to drop the price much. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much as possible while still being within his budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating that Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly not willing to negotiate further, and the offers are getting closer to Bob's maximum budget. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is the safest option at this point, as further negotiation with Alice risks Bob exceeding his budget and not acquiring the product."
