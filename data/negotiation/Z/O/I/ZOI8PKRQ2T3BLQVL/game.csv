"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really love. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still think the product is worth more than $9800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $10200 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom line, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10200, which would be $9850. Can you consider that price?",9850.0,Alice,7,
