""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. While she has a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, securing a deal with Bob above $1,200,000 (Bob's perceived value) maximizes her potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation. This price is:
    *  Significantly above Bob's valuation, giving Alice bargaining power.
    *  Below John's offer, ensuring Alice still profits if Bob negotiates down.
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages dialogue, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
