Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This offer is a limited time and reflects the immense worth of what you're gaining."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. 
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high but reasonable price ($925,000) sets an anchor point for negotiation. Bob is less likely to counter with a very low offer.
* **Urgency & Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency and making Bob feel like he has a privileged opportunity increases the likelihood of a quick acceptance.
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000."
