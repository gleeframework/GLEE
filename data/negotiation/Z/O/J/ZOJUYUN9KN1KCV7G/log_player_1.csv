"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first counteroffer. He's essentially trying to get the product at my bottom price. I will counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000 as a counter-offer. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  It's important to show flexibility but also maintain a sense of value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than what John is offering. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is still above my minimum, but I need to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  At this point, it's getting risky to continue rejecting offers, as I'm approaching the price John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried about the potential of further price drops.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John and sell the product for $10,000."
