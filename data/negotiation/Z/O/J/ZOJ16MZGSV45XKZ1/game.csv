"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. Would you be open to $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still quite low considering what this product can do for you. I could go down to $16,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, and I respect that.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we settle at $13,500?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",13500.0,Bob,6,
