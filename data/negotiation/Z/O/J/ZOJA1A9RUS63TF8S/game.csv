"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While I understand it's a valuable product, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,220,000? That's a fair offer, in my opinion.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
