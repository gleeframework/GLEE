Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we could start higher, aiming for a price that feels somewhat reasonable to Bob increases the chances of acceptance.

This strategy balances getting the best possible deal with ensuring the sale goes through, as we have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
