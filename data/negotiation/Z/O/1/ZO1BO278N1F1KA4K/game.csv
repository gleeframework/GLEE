"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true worth to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear you think it has value to you. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I was thinking.

"I understand you're being aggressive with your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to walk away. However, $800000 is still a bit too low for me.
