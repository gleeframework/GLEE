Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit and leaves room for counteroffers. 

I'm starting high to see if I can get close to my desired price. I'll keep John in mind as a backup and adjust my negotiation strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $8,500.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price but I'm willing to compromise a little more. This counteroffer is a good middle ground and gives Bob another chance to accept a price that's more favorable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm really hoping we can reach a deal, so I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that's something you're open to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make this a worthwhile deal for me. I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $10,000, I'm going to sell the product to him."
