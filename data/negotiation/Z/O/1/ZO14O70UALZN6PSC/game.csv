"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $8,500.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm really hoping we can reach a deal, so I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that's something you're open to.",8750.0,Bob,4,
