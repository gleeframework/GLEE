"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?  I'm really hoping to get this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $108. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",108.0,Alice,5,
