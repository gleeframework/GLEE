"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $102. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",102.0,Alice,5,
