"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This still represents significant value for you, and it allows me to secure a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $875,000? It's a significant compromise on my end, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",875000.0,Alice,5,
