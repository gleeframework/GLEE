"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
