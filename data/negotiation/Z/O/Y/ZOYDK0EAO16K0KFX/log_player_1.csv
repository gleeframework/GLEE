Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but will not sell below $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum. I hope this encourages him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $98 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. It's better to secure the sale now."
