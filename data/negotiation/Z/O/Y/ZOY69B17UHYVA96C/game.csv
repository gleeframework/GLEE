"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
