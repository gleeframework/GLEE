Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $150 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Conveying Value:** The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than the asking price, potentially influencing Bob's perception.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still giving Bob a reason to consider the offer."
