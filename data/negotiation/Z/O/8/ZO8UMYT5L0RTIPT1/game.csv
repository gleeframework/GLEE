"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this proposal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm afraid I need to maintain a higher price to meet my expectations. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value while taking into account your budget constraints. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another serious offer of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value I would get from owning this unique item. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I can stay within my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1100000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to closing the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1000000. I'm willing to make one more serious offer of $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value I would get from owning this unique item. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to closing the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options, including purchasing from John for $800000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
