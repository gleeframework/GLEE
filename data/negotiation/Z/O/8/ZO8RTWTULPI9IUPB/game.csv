"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I must respectfully decline the $1,750,000 offer. I am still unable to meet that price due to my financial constraints. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
