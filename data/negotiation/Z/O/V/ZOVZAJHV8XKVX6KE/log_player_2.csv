"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There's a chance Alice may be willing to lower her price, or you can always switch to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a lower price point and gives Alice room to counter without feeling like they're losing too much. It also leaves room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's a significant decrease from her initial offer. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, giving me more room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $9,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a price that's within my budget. It also creates a bit of tension and might encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still slightly over my ideal price point.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate. With only 5 rounds left, it's still worth trying to squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal and that I'm willing to compromise. It's still within my budget and leaves room for a small concession from Alice if needed. With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting closer to my goal, but I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too aggressive."
