"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's valuation as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. $85 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit higher than you're comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is closer to Bob's target price of $85. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising the price again is high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids the potential for a worse outcome."
