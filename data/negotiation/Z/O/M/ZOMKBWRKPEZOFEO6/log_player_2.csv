It's too early to tell if $9,500 is a good price. Let's see if we can get a lower offer from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $7,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but I'm hoping to find a price somewhere in between."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still not sure if $8,200 is a good deal. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice has come down a bit more, and at this point, $8,100 is a good deal compared to buying from John for $15,000. I'm happy to close the deal now."
