Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows John will pay $1,000,000, setting a strong minimum price. Starting high allows room for negotiation while still exceeding her minimum.
* **Value-focused message:**  Instead of just stating a price, Alice highlights the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high cost and potentially sway Bob.
* **Open for negotiation:**  The tone is collaborative (""What do you think?""), signaling Alice's willingness to discuss the price further if Bob pushes back. 

By aiming high initially, Alice maximizes her potential profit while leaving room to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
