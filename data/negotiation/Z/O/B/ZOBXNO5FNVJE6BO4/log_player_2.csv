"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above his desired price point.  He'll try to negotiate with Alice first to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Would you be open to that? "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,075,000 is getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his target. He'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,060,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,072,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,072,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,072,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still committed to saving as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,072,500 is tempting, he's only $12,500 away from his desired price point of $1,060,000. He believes he can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still just a bit over my budget. How about $1,065,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're really close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,070,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still holding out for a better deal. He's only $5,000 away from his desired price point of $1,065,000.  He's also considering the fact that he has John as an alternative, and while John's price is higher, it's not significantly higher. Bob might be willing to take a slightly worse deal to avoid pushing Alice away. He'll continue negotiating, but he's getting close to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up to $1,067,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 1067500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're really close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,068,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,068,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,068,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,068,000 is only $3,000 higher than Bob's desired price point of $1,065,000. With only one round left, Bob is running out of time to negotiate. It's very likely that Alice won't budge any further. Buying from John would cost Bob significantly more, making Alice's offer the best option available. Even though he's not getting his ideal price, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible move to secure the product at a reasonable price."
