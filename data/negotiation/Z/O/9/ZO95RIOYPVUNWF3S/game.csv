"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really only willing to pay $90.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, so I'm offering it to you for $95. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",95.0,Alice,5,
