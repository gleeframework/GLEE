"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying the product for $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I can potentially get closer to my target of $100 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $85 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to sell for. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $90? That's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, $90 is a good price and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and having to sell to John for only $100."
