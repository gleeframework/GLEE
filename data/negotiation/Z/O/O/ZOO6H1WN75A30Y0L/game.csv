"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $8,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $8,500.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer of $9,000. While it's an improvement, I'm still not able to meet that price point. I'd like to propose $8,800 as my final offer. This keeps the price within my budget while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,4,
