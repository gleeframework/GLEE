"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can definitely do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?
