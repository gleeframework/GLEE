Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale for $12,000 with John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage.  The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to your minimum, increasing your profit. However, you need to balance this with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $13,500.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're framing it as an exclusive opportunity, subtly implying demand.
* **Ambitious Price:**  Starting at $13,500 aims for a higher profit margin. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the dialogue open.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $12,500).
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a lower price might be more appealing.

**Remember, the key is to find a balance between maximizing your profit and securing the sale.**"
