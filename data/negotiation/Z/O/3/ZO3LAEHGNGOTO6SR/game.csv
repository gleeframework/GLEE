"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll experience.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a beautiful product, but $2,200,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it.  I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. To be frank, I'm considering another seller who's offering a similar product closer to my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for yours, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a very strong offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
