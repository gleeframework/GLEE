"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $90 is a good price, but I can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to budge.  $75 is still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$85 is a good price and closer to my initial target.  It's a good compromise, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
