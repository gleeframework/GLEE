,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $7,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's try $8,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact we're both willing to compromise. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
