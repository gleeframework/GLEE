"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$750,000 is a great price, but Bob can likely get a better deal.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get the price even lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  A counteroffer of $600,000 is a bold move, but it shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal.  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $650,000 is a good price, Bob can likely still get a better deal.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice before giving up and buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 625000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise but is still trying to get a good deal. A counteroffer of $625,000 is a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while staying firm on his desire for a price below Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $637,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $637,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $637,500. This is a good price for Bob, and continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away and forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.  The potential savings by continuing to negotiate are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether."
