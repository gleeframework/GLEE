"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's work towards an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This price would ensure both of us get a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Alice,5,
