Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should start by offering his maximum price. Since he's willing to buy the product from John for $12,000, there's no point in offering more. This also makes his position clear and leaves room for potential compromise."

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds remaining, so he should continue trying to lower the price."
