"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value significantly exceeds $1,200,000 to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is getting close, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 for this to make sense.  Do you think you can make that work?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
