"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's a price I feel is fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
