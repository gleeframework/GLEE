Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. You'll be getting a significant return on your investment. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a price that is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still allows me to make a profit. 
* This offer is appealing to Bob because he can still make a substantial profit ($600,000).
* If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my desired price. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
