,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to $1,250,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $1,150,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
