```

I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $800,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $950,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $925,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still believe the product is worth more than $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time and offer $900,000. This shows I'm willing to be flexible and hopefully we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering $875,000, which is only slightly better than John's offer of $800,000. At this point, the negotiation is not yielding a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk further rounds of back-and-forth.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000."
