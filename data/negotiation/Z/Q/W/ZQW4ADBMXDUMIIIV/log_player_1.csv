"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132

This is a good point to accept.  While I could push for more, getting $132 is a solid profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
