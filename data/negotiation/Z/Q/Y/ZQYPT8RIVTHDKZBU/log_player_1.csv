Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want at least $100 for the product.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can still increase the price if Bob makes a low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my initial goal of $120.  I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $120 goal, $112 is a good compromise.  It's higher than selling to John and also close enough to Bob's last offer that further negotiation might not be fruitful."
