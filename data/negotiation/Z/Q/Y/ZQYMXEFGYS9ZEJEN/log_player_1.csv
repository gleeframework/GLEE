"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go as low as $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $100 minimum. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and make the sure sale."
