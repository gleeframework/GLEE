Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Offering $10,000 gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum acceptable price, leaving space for further negotiation.
* **It leaves room for a counteroffer:** If Bob rejects, you can counter with a slightly lower price, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that balances your desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. You can do better, especially since John is willing to pay your desired price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired $10,000 mark. This gives you a better chance of getting a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer offers the following benefits:

* **It's closer to your desired price:** $9,250 is much closer to your initial offer of $10,000, increasing your potential profit.
* **It shows flexibility:** You're demonstrating willingness to negotiate, increasing the likelihood that Bob will accept.
* **It's still above Bob's offer:** This allows for further negotiation if necessary, while still securing a better price than Bob's initial offer."
