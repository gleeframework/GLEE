"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is under $800,000, and I'm willing to work with you to get there. However, I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",795000.0,Alice,5,
