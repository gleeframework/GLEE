``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for compromise. It also emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, making Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer if he wants."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept that offer yet, but I'm also not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $13,000? This would still give me a fair profit, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'm willing to accept it and sell the product to Bob for $12,500."
