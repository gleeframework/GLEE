"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  Let's try $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,400 to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",9400.0,Alice,5,
