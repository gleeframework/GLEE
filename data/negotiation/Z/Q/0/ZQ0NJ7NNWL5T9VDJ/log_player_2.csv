"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $12,000 to me. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, he can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating with Alice or buying from John.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to explore these other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. Rejecting the offer gives him another chance to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  Let's try $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,400 to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, the negotiation is taking a lot of time and effort.  At this point, Bob has a guaranteed option to get the product from John for $8,000.  It's likely that further negotiation with Alice will only save him a few hundred dollars, and it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the deal. Choosing to buy from John ensures a quick and guaranteed purchase at his maximum budget."
