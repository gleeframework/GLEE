"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making Bob more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is at my Minimum:** While I can sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price from Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has made an initial offer. This suggests he may be willing to go higher than $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this work. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, but justifying it with a message that emphasizes the product's value.
* **Maintain Some Leverage:**  I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility.
* **Encouraging a Deal:** The message is positive and focused on finding a solution that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with the option to sell to John at $12,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting, I can try to negotiate further with Bob in the future if he's willing to make additional purchases or if the market price for the product changes."
