"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's inherent value and my desire to establish a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $900,000. This offer reflects my genuine interest and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is tempting, it doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price acknowledges your interest and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still keen on getting this product, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute bottom line.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
