Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $900,000. This offer reflects my genuine interest and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
