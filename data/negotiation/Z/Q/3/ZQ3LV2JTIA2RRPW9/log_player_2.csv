You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can still save money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $125?  That would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

``` 
Alice's offer is a good deal for you,  you are getting the product for $130, which is below your maximum budget of $150 and a better price than John's offer.  It's also a decent price for Alice as she is getting $30 profit."
