Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed $800,000 backup offer. This allows her to start significantly higher, aiming to capture some of the value Bob sees in the product.
* **Justification for the price:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" Alice provides a vague but positive reason for the high price, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Open for negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to engage in discussions. Alice doesn't want to scare him off with an overly aggressive initial offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation skills:** This offer assumes Bob might be willing to negotiate.  If Alice suspects Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, she might want to start slightly lower.
* **Relationship building:** Even though Alice has a backup offer, alienating Bob completely isn't ideal for potential future business. The tone should remain respectful and professional."
