"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my asking price and still well above what the product is worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high for me to accept at this point.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I'm not able to go lower than $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
