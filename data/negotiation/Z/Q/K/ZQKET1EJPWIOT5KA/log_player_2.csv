"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This represents a significant opportunity to gain a competitive edge, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment. Let's discuss further and see how we can make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You would pay $1,400,000 from Alice versus $1,500,000 from John.
* **It's still within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is below that."
