"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there yet. Would you consider $1,050,000? It's a fair price that's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
