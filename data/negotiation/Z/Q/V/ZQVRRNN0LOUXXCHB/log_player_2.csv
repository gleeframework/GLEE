"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is a great fit for you, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. For now, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($1,200,000 vs $1,500,000). This indicates she's willing to negotiate. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still higher than I'm willing to pay initially. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can push her further down. There's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there yet. Would you consider $1,050,000? It's a fair price that's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price and is now offering $1,075,000.  This is within my initial budget, and while I could potentially keep negotiating, the risk of losing the deal or needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer is the most prudent choice, securing a good price while avoiding unnecessary delays or increased costs."
