"Alice, your product is intriguing, but I'm looking to secure a price closer to $800000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I understand this is a significant drop from your initial offer, but I believe it reflects a more realistic value based on my budget and market research. Let's find a middle ground to reach an agreement that benefits us both.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your perspective and have considered your offer carefully. While we aim to ensure a fair profit, we also recognize the importance of making deals that are beneficial for all parties involved. Therefore, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our original asking price and your proposed figure, aiming to create a win-win situation for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
