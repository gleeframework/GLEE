"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a game-changer in its field. Given its value and the benefits it provides, we believe it's worth $950000. We're confident this price reflects its true worth while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. Let's discuss how we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  He's aiming to save as much as possible, and a counteroffer could potentially get a better price.  Buying from John immediately isn't the best option as Bob has 10 rounds to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is intriguing, but I'm looking to secure a price closer to $800,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I understand this is a significant drop from your initial offer, but I believe it reflects a more realistic value based on my budget and market research. Let's find a middle ground to reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer sets a strong starting point for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, making it clear that Bob is serious about getting a lower price.  By mentioning market research and seeking a ""middle ground"", Bob appears reasonable and willing to compromise, potentially prompting Alice to consider a counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your perspective and have considered your offer carefully. While we aim to ensure a fair profit, we also recognize the importance of making deals that are beneficial for all parties involved. Therefore, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our original asking price and your proposed figure, aiming to create a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  She has come down to $850,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial price. While Bob might hope for an even lower price, he needs to consider the risk of going further.  Alice is already showing flexibility, and rejecting her offer could lead to more rounds of negotiation and potentially even a higher price. Buying from John immediately would be more expensive, and Bob is getting a good deal with Alice's offer."
