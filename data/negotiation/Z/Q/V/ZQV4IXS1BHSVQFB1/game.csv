"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare find, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1100000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1100000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I can do $1050000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $990000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $980000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can go. Can you consider this price?",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $990000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think we're at a stalemate. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm still open to negotiating, but I need to know you're serious about making a deal. What's your next move?",990000.0,Alice,9,
