"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still getting a good price. I'm aiming to maximize my earnings, but I also want to keep the deal open to Bob, as there's always the chance he might be willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and move on, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price.  It's still above my minimum of $12,000, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I won't settle for a drastically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I won't go below $12,000. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a good compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price, especially since he rejected my previous offer. If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $12,000, but I want to give Bob one more chance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. I've already lowered my price several times, and it seems he's not willing to budge.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower price."
