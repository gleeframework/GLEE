Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You are aware that the product holds a value of $1,200,000 for Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize your profit. Offering it slightly below his valuation increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit margin for you.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000, serving as a safety net if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high offer price and the likelihood of Bob accepting."
