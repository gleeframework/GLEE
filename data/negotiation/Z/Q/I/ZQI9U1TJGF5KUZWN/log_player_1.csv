{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value but still within the range where Bob might be willing to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response, keeping in mind my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).**  It's also far below the value I initially offered him ($12,000). Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **I have a strong fallback option with John.**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired value, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Bob at such a low price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer that is still significantly higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This will give Bob some room to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob that $9,000 is still a fair price.
* **Encouraging Response:**  I end with a question, prompting Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise price, I aim to entice Bob to reconsider while also keeping my profit margin relatively high. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider a lower offer, but still, keep my fallback option with John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).**  
* **I have a strong fallback option with John.** Selling to John guarantees me my desired value, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Bob at such a low price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired value but still lower than my initial offer. I will try to find a compromise price that is still acceptable to me but also tempting enough for Bob to consider. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm happy to discuss it further, but if we can't agree on a price closer to this, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sending a clear message that I'm serious about getting a better price, but I'm also open to negotiation. 
* **Compromise Again:**  This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, but it's closer to my desired value. 
* **Finality:** I subtly hint at moving on to other buyers if we can't agree. This creates a sense of urgency and potentially pushes Bob to consider the offer more seriously.

**Strategy:**

This is my last attempt to reach a deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll sell to John, securing my desired profit."
