"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at over $1000000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential. I'm asking $1500000.  I understand this is a significant investment, so please take your time to consider. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this opportunity could be truly beneficial for you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
