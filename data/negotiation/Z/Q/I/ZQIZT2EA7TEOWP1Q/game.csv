"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're serious about this offer, and I appreciate that.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  That's a compromise that's fair for both of us.  I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal, and I'll be able to move on with my day. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
