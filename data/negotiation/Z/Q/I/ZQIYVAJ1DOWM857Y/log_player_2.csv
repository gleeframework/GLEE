"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than the product's value to her ($1,000,000).  This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to establish a starting point that demonstrates Bob's serious interest while also giving Alice a clear idea of his price range.  The message emphasizes the value Bob sees in the product while acknowledging the need to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price.  He can use the information from Alice's previous counteroffer to make a more informed counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my genuine interest, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob has moved up from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,250,000 is still below Alice's previous offer but above her minimum value.
* **Clear Message:** The message clearly indicates Bob's interest while staying firm on his price. 

This approach allows Bob to inch closer to his desired price while still signaling his commitment to the deal."
