"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to buy it for $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, which I think is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $145, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can come to an agreement.",145.0,Alice,5,
