"I'm interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7200. Can you meet me at that price?",7200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $7800 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our initial prices, aiming to ensure both parties are satisfied with the transaction.",7800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $7800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7400 for the product. Can you consider this revised price?",7400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I propose a price of $7600 for the product. This move aims to find a balance between our interests and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome.",7600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $7600 is a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $7200, but I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll pay $7400, but I'd like to negotiate the price of the additional features you mentioned. Can we discuss the value of those features and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement?",7400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your concerns about the additional features. After considering your request, I propose a price of $7500 for the product. This includes a slight discount compared to my previous offers, while also taking into account the value of the additional features you mentioned. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",7500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $7500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7000, but I'd like to make it a final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a decision today. Can you consider this revised price?",7000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer the product to you at a price of $7250. This represents a significant discount from our initial offer and aims to provide a fair compromise. I hope this proposal aligns with your financial considerations and allows us to reach an agreement.",7250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $7000. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from another supplier.",7000.0,Bob,10,
