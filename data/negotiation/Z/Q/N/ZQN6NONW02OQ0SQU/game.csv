"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget, but I'm definitely interested in the product. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $17,000? I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous one? Would you be willing to go for $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  While $13,500 is still a bit too high for me, I'm willing to move up a little. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're really close! I appreciate you working with me on this. To finalize the deal, I'd be willing to come down to $12,250.  This is my final offer.",12250.0,Alice,7,
