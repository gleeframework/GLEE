Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we have a guaranteed offer for $150 from John. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and take the guaranteed profit."
