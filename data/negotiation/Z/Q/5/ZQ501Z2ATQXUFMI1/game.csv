"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is my absolute lowest. This still represents a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I hope we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're not seeing eye to eye on price, but I'm willing to make one final concession. $10,500 is my absolute final offer. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable. If you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,000, so I'll offer $9,750 for the product. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,
