"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for some flexibility in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. I'd like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $120. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need a little more to make this work. How about $105?  It's a fair price considering what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while aiming to get closer to my desired price. I'm also emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I'd like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $100. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and I'm happy to close the deal. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, Bob will lose interest and I'll end up having to sell to John for less."
