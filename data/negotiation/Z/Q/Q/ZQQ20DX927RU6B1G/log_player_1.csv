Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I can still get $80 from John. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $85? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and would like to counter with a price of $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly what I'd get from John, and I'm happy to sell to him. It's better to close the deal now and avoid further negotiations."
