{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push for a higher number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
