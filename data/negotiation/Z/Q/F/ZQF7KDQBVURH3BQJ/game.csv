"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $17,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can realistically offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
