Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $850,000 is still below my minimum of $800,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $900,000 is out of my budget range. Could you possibly lower the price to $875,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  Let's try $890,000. This is a very small step closer to your offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to $900,000, $880,000 is above my minimum of $800,000 and it's getting late in the negotiation.  It's time to close the deal."
