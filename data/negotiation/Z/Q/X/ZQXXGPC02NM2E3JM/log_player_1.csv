"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is still too far below what the product is worth.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000 and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
