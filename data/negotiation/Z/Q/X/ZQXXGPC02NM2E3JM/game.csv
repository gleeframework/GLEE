"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is still too far below what the product is worth.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000 and close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
