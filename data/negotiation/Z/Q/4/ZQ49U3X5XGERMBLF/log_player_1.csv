Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
