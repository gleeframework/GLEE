"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, given your own valuation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my own valuation.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product, which would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $875,000, which would be $900,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you and my own valuation.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $885,000, which is closer to my ideal price and still represents a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground here.",885000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation.",920000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $895,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",895000.0,Bob,8,
