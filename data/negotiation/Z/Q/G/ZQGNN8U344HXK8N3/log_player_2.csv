"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation, but it's still above Bob's target. Bob has 10 rounds, so rejecting and counter-offering to save money is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, given your own valuation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my own valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  Bob has several rounds left, so it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product, which would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $875,000, which would be $900,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you and my own valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, he still has several rounds left and can potentially negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for improvement, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $885,000, which is closer to my ideal price and still represents a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground here."", ""product_price"": 885000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is closer than before, Bob still has rounds left and can potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $895,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 895000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I'm thinking of $910,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to Bob's target, but with only one round left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John, even though it's slightly above his target, because there's no guarantee he can negotiate a better price with Alice in the remaining round.  This ensures Bob gets the product and avoids further negotiation."
