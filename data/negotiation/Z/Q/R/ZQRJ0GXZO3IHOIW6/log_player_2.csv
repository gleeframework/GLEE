You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since Alice is offering her minimum price.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Let's start by offering a price that's a bit lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. We'll see if she's willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down slightly.  While I'd like to continue negotiating,  $7,800 is a good price and saves me $200 compared to buying from John. Let's accept the offer."
