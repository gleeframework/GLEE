Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no need to go lower.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my desired profit.
* **Maintain Value Perception:** Starting too high might discourage Bob. $11,000 suggests a significant discount while still implying the product's value."
