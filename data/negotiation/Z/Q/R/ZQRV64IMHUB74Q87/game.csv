"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm prepared to accept $900000 for the product. This would still provide you with a significant value, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
