"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both benefit from this deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'll counter with $16,250. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",16250.0,Alice,5,
