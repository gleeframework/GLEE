"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is way too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, as I have other options. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't go higher than $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that values both of our needs. Let's try to close the deal here.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
