"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's more than double your maximum budget. It's best to reject and counteroffer to start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is way too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, as I have other options. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget, though it's getting closer. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up on a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm not ready to give in yet, and I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
