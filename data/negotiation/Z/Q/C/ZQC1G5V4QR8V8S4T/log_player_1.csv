Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, as I have other options. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate upwards, and we are still significantly above his initial offer. While John's offer is tempting, we have room to negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't go higher than $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that values both of our needs. Let's try to close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move much further from his $1,450,000 offer. We've negotiated well, but it's now more profitable to cut our losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  The difference is small, and continuing with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or further dragging out the negotiation."
