"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the information. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get for that price.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",125.0,Alice,7,
