"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premier product which has been valued at $1200000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am offering it to you today for an exclusive price of $950000. This is a special opportunity not to be missed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than your maximum, it's still a significant amount above Alice's value of $800,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You can always buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail. 

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the lower price, but $950,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while also allowing you to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To find a mutually beneficial solution, I am proposing a price of $900000 for the product. This price allows us to both achieve our financial goals without compromising too much on the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above your desired price point and leaves a significant profit margin for Alice. 
* **You have room for negotiation.**  You still have 7 rounds left to try and secure a better price. 
* **John remains a viable option.**  Buying from John is always on the table if you can't reach an agreement with Alice.

**Next Steps:** You will make another counteroffer to Alice in the next round. You could try to bridge the gap and suggest a price between your previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000? This price is a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve a reasonable outcome. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. To further explore a fair agreement, I would like to propose a price of $890000 for the product. This price reflects its value to you while also ensuring a satisfactory return for us. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial solution here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target price.**  $890,000 is only $40,000 above your previous counteroffer of $850,000.
* **You've already made significant progress.** You've brought the price down from $950,000 to $890,000.
* **You have limited time.**  You only have 5 rounds left. If you keep rejecting offers, you risk running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.

**While it's not your ideal price, accepting Alice's offer in this round seems like the best strategy to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price without risking a deal with John.**"
