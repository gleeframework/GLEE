Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering I value the product at $12,000, and it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
