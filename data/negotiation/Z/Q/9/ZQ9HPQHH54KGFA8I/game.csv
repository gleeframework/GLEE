"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this point.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $900,000, which would be $937,500. This is my next best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $937,500 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $920,000, which is very close to your last offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally close the deal.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is just $5,000 above your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to be fair here.  I'm willing to go up to $922,500.  This is very close to your last offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",922500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll give you an additional $1,000 off, bringing the price down to $924,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",924000.0,Alice,9,
