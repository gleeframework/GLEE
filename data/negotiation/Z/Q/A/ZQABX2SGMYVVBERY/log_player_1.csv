Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. This would allow us to close the deal without either of us having to compromise too much.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $13,500 offer. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
