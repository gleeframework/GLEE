"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $20,000 is already a significant discount on my end.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can do, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $14,500 - it's a small concession, but it allows me to finalize this deal. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $13,250.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is a very fair offer considering the value this product brings.  However, I need to be firm at $14,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered. ",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. This would allow us to close the deal without either of us having to compromise too much.",13500.0,Bob,8,
