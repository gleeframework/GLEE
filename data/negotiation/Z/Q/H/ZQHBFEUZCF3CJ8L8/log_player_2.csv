The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140. This means there's room for negotiation.  You should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? That's a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to $135, which is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer gets you the product for a reasonable price."
