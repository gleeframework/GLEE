"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $50?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand $200 is a bit steep, however, $50 is significantly less than what I'm willing to sell it for.  Could you do $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $180 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and say $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Alice. $140 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $115?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",115.0,Bob,6,
