"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It's best to try negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $50?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept it outright, it leaves room for negotiation and shows you're serious about buying but need a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand $200 is a bit steep, however, $50 is significantly less than what I'm willing to sell it for.  Could you do $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a little, but $180 is still far too expensive for you. It's worth trying to negotiate further towards your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $180 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground. It acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price much closer to your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and say $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but $140 is still significantly more than you want to pay. You're better off seeing if she'll come down further, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I see where you're coming from, Alice. $140 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $115?  That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but are firm on staying within a reasonable range of your budget. It's a balance between trying to secure a deal with Alice and not overpaying for the product."
