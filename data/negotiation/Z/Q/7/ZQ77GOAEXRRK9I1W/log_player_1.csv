**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to push for more, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiations.  Accepting $1,275,000 guarantees a significant profit above my minimum, whereas continuing carries the risk of him dropping his offer or time running out."
