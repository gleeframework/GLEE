"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable with a price around $6,000. Would that be workable for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Would you be open to that?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
