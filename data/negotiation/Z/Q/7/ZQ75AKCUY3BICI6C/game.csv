"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This is a significant investment, and I'm confident you'll find it to be well worth the value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  I'm confident this price will be fair for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
