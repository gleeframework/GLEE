Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has some interesting features, $20,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $15,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $15,000 is still a bit high for my budget though. Could we settle on $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get $15,000, accepting Bob's offer of $12,000 is the best decision at this point.  Here's why:

* **Time Value:**  Each round represents time and potentially lost opportunity. John's offer is good, but there's no guarantee another buyer won't come along later.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob is clearly willing to move, but in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to $15,000.
* **Profitable Deal:** $12,000 is still a significant profit over Bob's perceived value of $8,000."
