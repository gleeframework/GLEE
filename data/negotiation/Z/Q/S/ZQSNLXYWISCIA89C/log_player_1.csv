"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to go above his perceived value of $120.  Since my minimum acceptable price is also $120, there's no room for negotiation to get a better deal from Bob. It's in my best interest to sell to John immediately at $120 and avoid further time spent negotiating."
