This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also frames the product as valuable and unique to encourage Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value for the product.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Bob's offer:

# Bob's message: I'm close, but I'm still not comfortable with $960,000. I can do $955,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.

While I'm close to agreeing with Bob, I've already had several rounds of negotiation.  I'm confident that I can find a buyer willing to pay closer to my initial asking price, so I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
