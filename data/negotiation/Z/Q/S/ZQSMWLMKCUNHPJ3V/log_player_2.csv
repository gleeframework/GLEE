"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a valuable asset at a price that's still below its worth to you, and I get a faster sale without waiting for another buyer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at $800,000.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and secure the product at a lower price from John."
