"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above both Bob's value and our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" we aim to anchor the high price to the product's perceived value rather than appearing arbitrary.
* **Open Communication:** We end with an open-ended question, inviting Bob's perspective and encouraging a dialogue for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal. It's too early to accept his offer or sell to John at this point. We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle with our counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm confident this product offers immense value. How about we meet halfway at $2,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We've significantly lowered our price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. Meeting ""halfway"" suggests fairness.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is still well above our minimum and keeps us within a reasonable negotiating range. We're aiming for an agreement above $1,900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for a bit more, we are reaching the point of diminishing returns. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
