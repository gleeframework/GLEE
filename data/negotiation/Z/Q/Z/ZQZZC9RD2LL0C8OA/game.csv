"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of selling you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it can be incredibly beneficial for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $1150000. This price reflects its true value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate.  While $1100000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1125000 to reflect the true value of this product. It's a fair price that still leaves us both with a positive outcome. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1120000. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",1120000.0,Bob,4,
