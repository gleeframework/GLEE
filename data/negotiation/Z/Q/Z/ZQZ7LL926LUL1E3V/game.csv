"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a great asset to your business.  It's valued at $800000 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000.  This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits to your company.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
