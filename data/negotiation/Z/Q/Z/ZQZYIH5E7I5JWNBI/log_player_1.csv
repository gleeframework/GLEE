"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffers accordingly.  However, I'm always prepared to go with John's offer if things don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a little more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough to Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge on his offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $8,000.  I've already wasted a few rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to sell to John for $8,000, guaranteeing a decent profit."
