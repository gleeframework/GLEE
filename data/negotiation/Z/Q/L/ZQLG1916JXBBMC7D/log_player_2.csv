Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** Alice is holding firm at $925,000. While we'd ideally like to get it lower, she's unlikely to budge much further without a significant concession from our side.
* **Added Value:** The 5-year warranty and dedicated support package add tangible value to the deal. These extras could save us money in the long run and make the overall purchase more appealing. 
* **Time:** We've already used 7 rounds, and there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate as we get closer to the deadline.

Accepting at $925,000 with the added perks seems like a reasonable compromise at this point."
