"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  Let's finalize this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
