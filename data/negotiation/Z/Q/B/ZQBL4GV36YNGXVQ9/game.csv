"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $9,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,,
