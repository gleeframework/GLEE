"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $12,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a fair price considering its value. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $13,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe I can get a better price with another counteroffer or potentially from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,500 is still not a price I can accept. Let's try to find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at this price."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $13,750. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd like to get more, Bob's offers are getting closer to my bottom line, and I'm not sure we'll be able to agree on a price within the remaining rounds. John's offer guarantees me a good price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
