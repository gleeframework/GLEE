"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $850,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is the best I can do for now. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice. I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $775,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on $740,000?",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $760,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer. I can offer you $750,000 to make this deal happen today. It's a fair price and I'm ready to close if you are.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750,000. I can see that you're making a serious effort to close the deal, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer. I'm willing to split the difference at $757,500.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",757500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $762,500, which is just a small increment above your latest offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",762500.0,Alice,9,
