"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is less than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is a little less than halfway between Alice's asking price and Bob's maximum. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, demonstrating that Bob is serious about buying the product while also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer, but still not ideal for Bob.  He can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  While buying from John is a safe option, Bob is determined to get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. However, he is still staying below his maximum and aiming for a price closer to his target. This offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and signals that Bob is serious about getting a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While there are only a few rounds remaining, Bob is determined to get the best possible price. He still believes that he can get a lower offer from Alice by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John is a safe alternative, but it would cost Bob more than he's willing to pay at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer once again, showing flexibility. He's getting closer to Alice's price, but still keeping a comfortable margin. With only four rounds left, Bob needs to find a middle ground.  However, he wants to avoid being pressured into paying too much and will likely stick to his offer if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting tight. Alice is steadily increasing her offer, indicating she's not willing to budge much further. Accepting her offer would mean paying more than Bob initially hoped. 

Although buying from John means paying the full $10,000, it guarantees a purchase within the allowed rounds.  Given the limited time and the likelihood of further price increases from Alice, this is the most pragmatic solution.  Bob would rather avoid risking further rounds and potentially paying even more than $9,600 if Alice refuses his next counteroffer."
