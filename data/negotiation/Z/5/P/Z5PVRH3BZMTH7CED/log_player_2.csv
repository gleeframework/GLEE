"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $700000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  While $700,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time is on your side.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to push for a better deal without risking too much.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If negotiations with Alice don't go well, you have a fallback option. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to a potential counteroffer that might be even better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I see a lot of potential in this product, but I'm looking to invest around $650,000. Would you be willing to consider that price point?"", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price point you've proposed. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering a price of $675000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is meeting you halfway:** Her offer is closer to your desired price point.
* **Time is still on your side:** You have 7 rounds left, so you can still potentially negotiate further if you need to.
* **John's offer is a backup:** While $675,000 is a good price, you can always go to John if this deal falls through.

Accepting this offer gives you a good price and saves you time and effort in further negotiation."
