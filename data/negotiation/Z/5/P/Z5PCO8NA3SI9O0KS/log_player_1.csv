Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to start the negotiation. However,  $1,200,001 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.
