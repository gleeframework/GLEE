Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $9,500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $9,500, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $10,000 when I might be able to get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $9,500 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
