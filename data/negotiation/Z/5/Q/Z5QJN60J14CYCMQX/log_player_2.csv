The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so he shouldn't pay more than that.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to try to get a better price."

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
