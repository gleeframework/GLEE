Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this presents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start by aiming slightly below John's offer ($1,500,000) to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring we don't go below our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" and ""significant returns"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer doesn't start at $1,500,000 in case Bob tries to negotiate down. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he sees a strong future return on investment.  
* **Risk Appetite:** Offering it at $1,300,000 carries a slight risk that Bob will reject the offer, and we'll have to settle for John's $1,500,000. However, the potential for a higher profit is worth the calculated risk."
