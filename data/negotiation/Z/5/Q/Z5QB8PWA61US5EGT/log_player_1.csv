Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount off the market value, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value it would bring you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your alternatives:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000. This is your ""walk-away"" point.  Any deal with Bob needs to be better than this.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Highlighting value to Bob:**  While not revealing your bottom line, you emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the price and make it more appealing.

It's a balancing act.  You want to maximize your profit, but being too greedy could lead to Bob rejecting the offer."
