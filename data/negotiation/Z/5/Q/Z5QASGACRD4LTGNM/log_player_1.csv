"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

I'm still holding out for a higher price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to negotiating further, but $11,500 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $12250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $11750, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not high enough. I'm not sure if I can get him to budge any further.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
