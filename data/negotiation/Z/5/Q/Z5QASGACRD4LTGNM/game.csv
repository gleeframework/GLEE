"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, but that's as high as I can go.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiating further, but $11500 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $12250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $12250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $11750, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go.",11750.0,Bob,6,
