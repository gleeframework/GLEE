{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first. There's no downside to rejecting her initial offer and seeing if she's willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better deal.  I'm aiming to save at least 20% on the product."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my desired price point. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get her down further.  There's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still want a price that's closer to my maximum budget. I'm hoping that she'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above my desired price point.  I believe there's still room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a couple more rounds to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not yet ready to accept her offer or switch to John, as I'm hoping to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer again, this time to $11,250. This is a compromise between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.  I believe this is a fair price that both of us can agree to."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has come down a bit, it's still not quite what I'm aiming for. I have only three rounds left, and I'm still hoping to save more money.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to offer $11,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. I'm aware that we only have two rounds left, so I need to get close to a final price. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer as it's a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but still want to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,937.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.  While her offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I've already invested several rounds in negotiation, and it's clear that we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

With only one round remaining, it's better for me to secure the product from John for $12,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
