"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $800,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
