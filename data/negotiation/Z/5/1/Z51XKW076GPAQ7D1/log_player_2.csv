"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept on the first offer.  There's a chance Alice is willing to sell for less, and rejecting allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (a 33% discount) puts pressure on Alice to negotiate. This allows you to gauge her flexibility and sets a lower price point for further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice has shown she's willing to compromise, and there's a chance she'll go lower.  Rejecting gives you another opportunity to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already lowered her price by $20. This suggests she's willing to negotiate. We're incrementally raising our offer, showing a willingness to compromise, while keeping the pressure on to get a better deal.  $120 is a reasonable middle ground for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is a good price, especially considering we're halfway through the rounds.  Continuing to negotiate risks getting stuck in a stalemate and potentially losing out on the deal entirely.  Accepting ensures we get the product at a good price within our budget."
