"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. Would you consider $2,100,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $2,050,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
