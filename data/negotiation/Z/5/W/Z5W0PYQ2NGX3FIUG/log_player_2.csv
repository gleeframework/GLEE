"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is offering the product for that exact amount, it's best to accept the offer. There's no need to risk further negotiation or pay the same amount to John."
