"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,250,000?  This would still provide you with a good profit and allow me to purchase the product within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be reasonable.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,300,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and allow us to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to make a bit more. I'm thinking of a price of $1,320,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too much.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,310,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could finally close this deal.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,310,000, but I need to make a bit more. I'm thinking of a price of $1,325,000.
