"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking for a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
