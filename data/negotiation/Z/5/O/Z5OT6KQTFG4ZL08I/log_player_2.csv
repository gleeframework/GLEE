"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is quite high, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this fantastic product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. You have a better option with John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. This product is definitely valuable, but that's my maximum budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but getting closer. However, you can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Therefore, it's more beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a lower price, potentially closer to your target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000. This feels like a fair price that would work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, but it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can get the product from John for that price, which is guaranteed and avoids any further negotiation with Alice.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Alice might not budge further, and you could end up paying more than you want."
