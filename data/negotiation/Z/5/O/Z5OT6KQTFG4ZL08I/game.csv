"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is quite high, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this fantastic product at a discounted price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1000000. This product is definitely valuable, but that's my maximum budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $1050000. This feels like a fair price that would work for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
