Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a special price of $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but below my minimum ($15,000). This creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my desired minimum price."
