"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your offer, but I need to get at least $10,500.  This would allow us both to get a decent deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $10,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a good outcome. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $9,750? I'm really trying to find a middle ground here, but I need to stay within my budget.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise one last time and come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. If you're serious about acquiring this product, let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
