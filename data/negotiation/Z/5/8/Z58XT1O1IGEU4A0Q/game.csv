"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the original price I had in mind. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can offer you the product for $14000. It's a bit higher than your counteroffer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,

It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
