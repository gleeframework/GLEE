"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and well within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a price even closer to $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  $11,750 is closer to Bob's target of $10,000 than previous offers.
* **Further negotiation might be futile:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **The deal is still good for Bob:**  Paying $11,750 is significantly less than buying from John for $15,000.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that might not result in a better deal."
