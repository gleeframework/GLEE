"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. 
* You are willing to pay up to $800,000, so there is room for negotiation.
* It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still above your maximum price.
* It shows Alice you are serious about buying but are not willing to pay her full asking price.
* It leaves room for further negotiation, as Alice still has a chance to get more than she would from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are sticking to your previous counteroffer, showing that you are serious about that price.
* This strategy is designed to test Alice's willingness to negotiate further. 
* If Alice doesn't budge, you can then decide whether to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your limit. 
* You have a few rounds left, and it's worth seeing if you can get Alice down to your target price.
* If you accept now, you'll be paying more than you need to. 
* The next counteroffer might be successful, or you can buy from John if Alice is unwilling to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a smaller step down than the previous one, indicating you are getting closer to the end of your negotiating range.
* It shows Alice you are serious about closing the deal but are still unwilling to go above $875,000.
* This counteroffer is still closer to Alice's previous offer than your previous one, suggesting a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and am willing to compromise further.  I'm offering a final price of $890,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* Alice's offer is the closest she's come to your maximum price point.
* You are running out of rounds, and there is a chance Alice will not go lower.
* Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product without significantly exceeding your budget, and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John. 
* While you can still make a counteroffer, the risk of not securing the product from either seller is too high."
