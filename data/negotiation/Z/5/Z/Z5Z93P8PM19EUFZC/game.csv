"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and am willing to compromise further.  I'm offering a final price of $890,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note.",890000.0,Alice,7,
