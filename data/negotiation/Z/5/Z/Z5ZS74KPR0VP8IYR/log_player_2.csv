# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given your valuation of the product, I propose to sell it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's final offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John, and further negotiation may be time-consuming with no guarantee of success."
