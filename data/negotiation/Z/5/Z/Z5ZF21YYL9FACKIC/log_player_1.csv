{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $1,000,000, so you have room to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A large initial offer can encourage Bob to negotiate seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum:**  You're not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.
* **There's room to negotiate:** You can likely get a higher price from Bob by counter-offering.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Having John as a backup option gives you leverage to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** This offer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than your previous offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  Highlighting the ""good deal"" for both sides can make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is not willing to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** You're not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.
* **You have a guaranteed buyer:** John is willing to pay your minimum, so you don't need to settle for a lower price.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant increase:** Bob is already close to his perceived value, and it's unlikely he'll budge much further. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a protracted process with no guarantee of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a good middle ground.  This is my final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This signals that you are serious about securing a deal with Bob, but also that you won't go lower. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  It's a small decrease from your previous offer, showing you're still willing to negotiate, but it's also a substantial increase from Bob's last offer, leaving little room for further bargaining.
* **Threat of Walking Away:**  Mentioning another buyer adds pressure to Bob to reach a deal before you move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** You're not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  You have a confirmed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum.
* **Negotiations are unlikely to yield a significant increase:** Bob has reached his perceived value of the product, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price closer to your desired amount.

It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a protracted process."
