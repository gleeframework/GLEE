"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is too high.  You're looking to save as much as possible, and $900,000 is significantly closer to your maximum than to Alice's minimum.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $950,000. Let's see if we can shake on it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still too high.  It's only $50,000 lower than her initial offer and much closer to your maximum than her minimum.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you more leverage to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $825,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I need to make a profit, after all. Let's see if we can close the deal at $900,000! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking to $900,000. While this is a lower price than her previous offers, it's still not close enough to your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you have more rounds left and there's room for Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize this transaction.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $850,000, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high with her offer of $920,000. While it is a slight decrease from her previous offer, it is still significantly higher than your target price. Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives you more room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your desired range. You have a few rounds left, and it is worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but $920,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $885,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial deal. Let's try to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise. Let's finalize the deal at $900,000! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is once again sticking to her price of $900,000. While this is a lower price than her previous offers, it is still not close enough to your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you have one round left and there's still room for Alice to come down in price.  Rejection will give you one final shot to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 875000}
