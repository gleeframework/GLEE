{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This initial offer is high, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?  That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to get a little closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. How about we split the difference at $92.50? That's still a good deal for you and closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $88.50.  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

$88.50 is a good compromise and close to my desired price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
