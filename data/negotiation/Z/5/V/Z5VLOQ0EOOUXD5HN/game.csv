"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget for this is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $10,000.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,000 is still a bit above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise and a fair deal for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
