"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $10000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8800. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject the next offer and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
