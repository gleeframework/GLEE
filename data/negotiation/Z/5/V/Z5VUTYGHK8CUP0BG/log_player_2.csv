{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product for less than $1,200,000 from John, so there's no need to accept Alice's first offer."

It's still worth pushing for a lower price. You can potentially get it for closer to your target of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate."

We're getting closer to your target price, but it's still worth trying to get Alice to come down further. You can potentially save another $40,000."

Alice's offer is getting further away from your target price. It's better to buy from John at this point and secure the product for $1,200,000. You've already spent several rounds trying to get a better deal from Alice, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better offer from her within the remaining rounds."
