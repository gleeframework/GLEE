"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and worth much more than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob (""worth much more"").
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in a conversation, making the offer less of a hard ""take it or leave it""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm not desperate, so I'm going to try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, and it gives me some wiggle room to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a compromise price, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profits.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that $95 is still a good deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting his offer outright, I'm showing that I'm not desperate and have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $92 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a little more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $94, but I'm not going any lower than that.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating my bottom line, showing I'm serious but also open to a final compromise.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm using phrases like ""Let's make this happen!"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to close the deal.
* **Small Concession:** By dropping to $94, I'm showing flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose $93 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $93 is just $1 away from my counteroffer of $94.  At this point, I'm close enough to my minimum value that I'm willing to accept the offer and close the deal.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $120.  Additionally, there's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away entirely."
