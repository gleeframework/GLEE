Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate but I need to get a better price to make this worthwhile. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  To show my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still provides you with a good value. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While that price is getting closer, I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget. Could we do $950,000? That would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I still need to get a better price than $950,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
