"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can you consider $9,750? It's the best I can do.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
