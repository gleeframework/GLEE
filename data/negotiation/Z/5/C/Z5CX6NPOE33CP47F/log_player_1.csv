"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible while keeping in mind that Bob has a lower valuation. 
* By starting with a reasonable price and being open to negotiation, I hope to create a positive dialogue and reach a mutually agreeable outcome.
* However, I'm also aware of the option to sell to John for $15,000, which provides a safety net and leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would be a considerable loss for me.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have 8 rounds left and still have the option of selling to John for $15,000. This gives me leverage to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Message:** I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the fairness of the compromise. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us. 
* By meeting Bob halfway, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to drastically lower my price.
*  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can you consider $9,750? It's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, $9,750 is still significantly lower than my desired outcome.  I'm not yet ready to accept a price so far below my target.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still in a strong position with the option to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Continue negotiating:** With several rounds remaining, I'll continue to counter-offer and aim for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Signal flexibility:** By rejecting but not immediately selling to John, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to close the deal at a low price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $10,500 and moves closer to Bob's offer of $9,750.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone while emphasizing the value Bob will receive from the product.  I'm also framing the offer as a ""middle ground"" to encourage agreement. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding common ground:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price of $15,000 and still have the option to sell to John if necessary.
* **Keeping negotiations open:** With several rounds left, I'm aiming for a deal that is both profitable for me and agreeable to Bob."
