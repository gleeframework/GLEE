Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), I want to start negotiations significantly higher to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message frames the price as related to the product's ""value and potential,"" not just an arbitrary number.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and begin a negotiation.

By starting high, I give myself room to potentially:

1. **Secure a much higher profit** if Bob accepts the initial offer.
2. **Negotiate down** and still end up with a price well above my minimum."
