"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired range. I'm also being friendly and optimistic, aiming to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a fairer agreement. Given the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $750,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $850,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Could we agree on $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $800,000.  Accepting Bob's offer at $825,000 is a good compromise and ensures a solid profit."
