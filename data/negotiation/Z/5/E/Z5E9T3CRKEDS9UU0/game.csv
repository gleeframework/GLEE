"Alice, thanks for your offer. That initial price is quite high.  I'm more comfortable in the ballpark of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value while recognizing your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still significantly above my budget. To be realistic, I can offer up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider $1,700,000 as my final offer. This is a substantial concession on my part, and I need you to meet me closer to that figure if we're to make a deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me, I am willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer.  I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
