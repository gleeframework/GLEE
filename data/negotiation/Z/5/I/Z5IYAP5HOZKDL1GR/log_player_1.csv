Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a bit more than my minimum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500. Can you consider $11,750? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident that I can get my minimum of $12,000 from John.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob for a lower price when I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum."
