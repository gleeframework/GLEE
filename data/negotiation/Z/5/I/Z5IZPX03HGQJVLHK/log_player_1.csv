Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still below my initial target, it's only slightly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather get $110 than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale altogether."
