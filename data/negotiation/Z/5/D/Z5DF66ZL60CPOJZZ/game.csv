"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm comfortable going up to $950,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is $25,000 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's the closest we can get to a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
