"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose an offer of $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're considering.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1000000 is significantly below what I consider to be a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to show my commitment to working with you, but I need to be closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1300000 is a bit high for the product. I would like to propose an offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our interests.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
