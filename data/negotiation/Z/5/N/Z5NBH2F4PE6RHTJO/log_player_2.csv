"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's wise to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.  You can use the knowledge that you have a backup option (buying from John) to your advantage during the negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't accept anything under $12,000. This product is a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price."
