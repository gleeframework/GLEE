"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't accept anything under $12,000. This product is a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident you'll agree.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the value of this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
