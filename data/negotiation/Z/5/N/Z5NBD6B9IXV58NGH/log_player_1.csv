You have three options:

```

I'm going to counter with $18,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping to signal that I'm getting closer to accepting his price.  I'm also getting closer to my minimum, so I'm not willing to go much lower."

While $16,500 is a tempting price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again. There are still several rounds left and I'm hoping we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm close to my minimum, but I'm not confident that I can get Bob to go higher. With only a couple of rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
