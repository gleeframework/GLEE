I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to see how interested Bob is in the product."

You have three options:

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob doesn't budge, I might consider selling to John."

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $13,250. It's getting close to Bob's last offer, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. If he rejects this, I'll likely go with John's offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell to John. We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and it seems unlikely he'll go much higher than $12,600.  I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price than John's offer."
