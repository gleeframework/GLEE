"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The offer is too high.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Bob should start by offering the lowest possible price he's willing to pay. This is John's price and the maximum Bob is willing to spend.  It's a bold move, but it establishes Bob's limit and forces Alice to decide if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it is closer to Bob's maximum price, he should continue to try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob should increase his offer slightly, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price below her last offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining his leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down significantly in price. Bob can accept the offer and get the product for a price that is within his budget and below John's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject and he would be forced to buy from John. It's a good compromise."
