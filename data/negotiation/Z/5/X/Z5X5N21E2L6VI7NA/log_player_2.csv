Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

This is the best option for a few reasons:

* **Alice is at her lowest price:**  She's explicitly stated this is her final offer and it aligns with her product's value to her ($800,000).
* **Significant savings:**  You're getting the product for $700,000 less than John's price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price."
