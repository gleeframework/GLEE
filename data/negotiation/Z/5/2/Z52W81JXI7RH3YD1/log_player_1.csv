Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $80 (selling to John is your backup).
* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Splitting the difference:** Offering the product at $100 splits the potential profit ($120 - $80 = $40) evenly between you and Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic and presents a fair deal. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $100. He might try to negotiate further down. You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or risk losing the sale to Bob."
