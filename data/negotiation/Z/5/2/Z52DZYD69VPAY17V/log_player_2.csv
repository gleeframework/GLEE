"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on your investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a better deal, ideally closer to your $800,000 limit."
