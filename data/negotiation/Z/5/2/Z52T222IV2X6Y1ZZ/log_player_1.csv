"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more to me than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it maintains my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to give up yet, and I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm willing to drop my price further, but only to a point where I'm still above my minimum. This is a strong counteroffer that shows flexibility while maintaining my financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob isn't going to get me much closer to my minimum price.  I've made significant concessions, and it seems unlikely he'll go much higher. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
