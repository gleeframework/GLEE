"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1300000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum, you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.  This offer is fair and reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It is also below the product's worth to Alice, making it potentially appealing. This leaves room for further negotiation while still being within your desired budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1200000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal. It's within your budget and represents a significant decrease from her initial price.  You're still getting a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you for a lower price. Accepting this offer is the most financially sound decision.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are not worth risking the deal with Alice."
