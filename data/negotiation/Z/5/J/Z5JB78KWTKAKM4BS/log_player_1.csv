"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation and is below Bob's maximum value. It's a good starting point to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $700,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will reject the offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. I'll reject the offer and see if we can get closer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price but still leaving room for negotiation.  This offer shows I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not going to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum price, but the negotiation is taking time. It's becoming risky to continue with Bob. While I could keep negotiating, I'm worried we might not reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'll take the sure thing."
