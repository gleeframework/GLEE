"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
