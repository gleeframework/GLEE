"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget. I believe this is still a good deal for you as it's significantly higher than what John is offering me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product brings, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still slightly over my budget. I'm still firm on $1,000,000. I understand this is a valuable product, but I'm confident this offer is fair considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
