"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your asking price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve a reasonable outcome. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
