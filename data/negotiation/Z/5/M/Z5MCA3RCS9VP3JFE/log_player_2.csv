"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price, and it's a fair offer that balances both our needs.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($8,000).  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get an even better price. There's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that considers both our needs.  I'm open to further discussion if you'd like, but I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still hesitant to accept the offer. While $10,000 is getting closer to his preferred price, he can potentially still get a better deal.  There's still some wiggle room, and he wants to see if Alice will come down further. Rejecting the offer allows him to counter and potentially secure a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to offer $9,750. This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a good midpoint that reflects the value of your product while staying within my budget. I'm confident that this is a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $10,250. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of my product while also being within your budget. I believe this is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been negotiating diligently, but the price is still above his $8,000 limit.  Alice's last offer of $10,250 shows that there's still a significant gap between their desired prices.  With only 3 rounds left, it's becoming unlikely that Alice will come down to a price Bob is willing to pay.  

To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a price higher than his limit, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees he gets the product at his desired price and avoids any further negotiation."
