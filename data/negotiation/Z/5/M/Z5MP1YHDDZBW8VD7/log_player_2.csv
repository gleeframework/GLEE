"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment.  Let's start the conversation with a price of $900,000. I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you should aim for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $750,000 is simply too low.  To reflect the true value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good price, and allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, although it's closer to what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
