Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum price of $1,200,000, and I still have 8 rounds to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left and believe I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. How about $910,000? I'm serious about buying the product, and I think this price reflects its value while working for both of us.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $910,000 is tempting, I have 4 rounds left and believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'm still quite a bit away from my minimum price of $1,200,000."
