"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice:**  You pay $90, which is still within your budget of $100.
* **Buying from John:** You pay $100, which is the maximum you're willing to spend.

It's always better to save money, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
