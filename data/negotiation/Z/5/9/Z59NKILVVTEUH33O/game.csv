"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $500, which will give you additional support and benefits. So, the total price will be $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
