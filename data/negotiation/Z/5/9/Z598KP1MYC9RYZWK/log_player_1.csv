Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but still high enough to potentially interest Bob.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the deal for Bob. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a relatively high offer, giving Bob room to negotiate downwards. 
* I'm also mentioning the product's true value to create a sense of urgency and a potential loss for Bob if he rejects the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* I'll keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as my ""safety net"" throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to Bob for $900,000 would leave a substantial amount of money on the table.
* **Negotiation Power:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power and the possibility of securing a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value. It's important to be firm but reasonable.  I could offer something like $1,100,000, acknowledging Bob's position while still leaving room for potential compromise. 
* I will continue to monitor John's offer as a safety net."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.
