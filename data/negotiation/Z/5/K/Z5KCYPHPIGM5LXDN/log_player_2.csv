"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I understand it's a substantial investment, but I believe this offer represents a strong value proposition. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
