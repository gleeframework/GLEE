"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being reasonable for me.",875000.0,Alice,3,
