"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product for less anywhere else.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $11000, and I believe that's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm trying to be flexible here, but $11000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12000, which is my absolute minimum. Let's close this deal. It's a win-win for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12000. How about we split the difference and settle at $11500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal quickly.",11500.0,Bob,6,
