```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm trying to be flexible here, but $11000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12000, which is my absolute minimum. Let's close this deal. It's a win-win for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This tactic shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal while still trying to get a lower price. 
* **Fair Compromise:** The message emphasizes that this is a fair deal for both of us. 
* **Quick Deal:** Highlighting a quick deal can incentivize Alice to accept, as it reduces her time and effort in negotiating. 

I'm hopeful that this offer will convince Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.  There are still 4 rounds left, and I believe there's still room for us to find common ground."
