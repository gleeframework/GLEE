"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500. This is still above Bob's maximum value of $15,000.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John for $15,000 is also a possibility. 
* **Strategy:** It's worth rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price. Bob has 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save money.
* **Alice's Minimum:** We know Alice is willing to sell for at least $12,000.
* **Counteroffer:**  Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal while leaving space for Alice to potentially counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money. 
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum value.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John for $15,000 is still a possibility.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting this offer and counter-offering again is the best course of action. There's still time to negotiate a lower price, and Bob has already shown a willingness to walk away."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save money, but also avoid losing the deal.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is too high, but shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer:**  Offering $13,000 is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's previous offer, but still within Bob's budget. 
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also putting pressure on Alice to consider a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,500 is still too high for Bob.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John for $15,000 is still an option.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going. It also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better price.  Since Bob has 5 rounds left, it makes sense to keep trying."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save money, but also avoid losing the deal.
* **Alice's offer:** $15,000 is at Bob's maximum price, meaning he won't be able to save any more money with her. 
* **Alternative:** John is selling the same product for $15,000, making him an equally viable option.
* **Strategy:** It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice when John offers the same price. There are only three rounds remaining, and any further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get a lower price. Bob is better off securing the product from John."
