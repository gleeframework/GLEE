"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,500 is a fair offer, I'm looking to get closer to $14,000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",13250.0,Alice,3,
