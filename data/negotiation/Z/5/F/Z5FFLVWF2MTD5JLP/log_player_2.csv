"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $500,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal. It's unlikely Alice will sell for her absolute minimum in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $400,000 is a bold move, but it signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget.  The goal is to see how Alice reacts to this aggressive counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.  $450,000 is a good price, especially considering Bob's budget of $800,000. Accepting this offer secures the product for a substantial discount and avoids the risk of further negotiation or ending up paying John's higher price."
