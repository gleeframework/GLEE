"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can agree on.",10500.0,Bob,4,
