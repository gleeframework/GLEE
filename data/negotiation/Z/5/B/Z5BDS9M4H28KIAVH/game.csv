"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000. Would you be open to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can find a better price elsewhere if we can't find common ground. How about $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",13000.0,Bob,4,
