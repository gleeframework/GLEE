"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer gives me more room to negotiate upwards. While $6,000 is a lowball offer, it allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal than her initial offer or even John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $9,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I want to pay. Alice reducing her price suggests she's willing to negotiate. I'll push a bit further before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm moving closer to my maximum but still leaving some room for negotiation in case Alice is completely unwilling to budge from this point. $7,500 represents a fair compromise, splitting the difference between her lowered offer and my previous one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It seems Alice is unwilling to go below $9,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a price significantly closer to John's $8,000.  At this point, buying from John is the most financially sensible choice."
