Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher than the absolute minimum allows for potential counter-offers. Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but we still have a good chance of settling above our minimum.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could scare him off.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale to Bob."
