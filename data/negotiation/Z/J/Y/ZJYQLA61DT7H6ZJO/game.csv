"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $17,000, which is a more reasonable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $14,000? That's a significant price drop and a very fair offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I could potentially do $12,000, but that's really the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
