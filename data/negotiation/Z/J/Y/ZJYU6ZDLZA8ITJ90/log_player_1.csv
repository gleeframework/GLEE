Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000?

We're getting closer, but I still think we can get Bob closer to $17,000.  It's better to try for a higher price and potentially meet in the middle than to accept $16,000 now."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $16,500. This price reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting $16,500 is better than risking a sale to John at $15,000."
