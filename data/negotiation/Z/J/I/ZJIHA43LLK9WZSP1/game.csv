"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase it right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
