"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum value for the product. It makes sense to reject this offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is my best price, considering my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We are starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This sets a clear expectation that we are trying to negotiate a more favorable deal.
* **Reasoning:** We provide a reason for the offer (budget constraint) and highlight our interest in the product.
* **Best price:**  We state this is our best price, hoping to create a sense of finality and encouraging Alice to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum value for the product.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price, as it's still better than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  We show that we are willing to negotiate and have moved closer to Alice's position.
* **Fairness:**  We frame our offer as a fair compromise.
* **Potential value:** We emphasize the product's value, subtly implying that it's worth more to Alice than to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This is my final offer. I believe this price represents a fair compromise that recognizes both its value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your limit:**  While this is getting close to your maximum, you can still try to get a better deal.
* **""Final offer"" tactic:**  Alice's claim of a final offer is a negotiating tactic.  You should try to see if they'll budge.
* **Better option:** You still have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm ready to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum for this product. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to seriously consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We again emphasize our absolute maximum, creating pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Alternative:**  We subtly remind Alice that we have alternative options (John).
* **Compromise:** We've come up to a point where we're only $100,000 away from Alice's offer, making it a tempting compromise for both parties."
