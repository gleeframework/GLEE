"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer significantly above your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""potential"" and ""significant return,"" we're emphasizing value that might justify a higher price in Bob's mind, even if it's above his initial perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves ample space for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation active. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the John offer ($1,500,000) in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, we can always fall back on this guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is my best price, considering my value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is interested:** His message indicates strong interest despite finding the initial price high. This suggests room for negotiation.
* **Above Bob's valuation:**  His offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **John as leverage:** The guaranteed offer from John provides a strong fallback position. We are not desperate to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, we should counter with an offer significantly lower than our initial ask but still well above both Bob's offer and our minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** We've lowered the price by $400,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his range.
* **Above John's Offer:** Our counteroffer remains significantly higher than John's standing offer of $1,500,000, protecting our potential profit. 
* **Justification:** We're still emphasizing the product's value to justify a price point above Bob's offer.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** This offer invites Bob to counter again, as he's likely to find it more reasonable than the initial price but still potentially negotiable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Bob increased his offer by $200,000, showing movement and a desire to close the deal. However, it's still below John's offer.
* **Testing Bob's limit:**  We're not sure if $1,400,000 is his absolute maximum.  By rejecting, we can see if he's willing to go higher.
* **John as a safety net:**  We're not desperate. Having John's offer allows us to be firm in our negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

We should send a counteroffer slightly above John's offer ($1,500,000), showing Bob we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This is my final offer. I believe this price represents a fair compromise that recognizes both its value and your budget."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our price by $200,000, a significant amount that might encourage Bob to close the deal.
* **Slightly Above John:** The offer is still $100,000 above John's guaranteed price, ensuring we maximize potential profit.
* **Finality:** By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we're creating a sense of urgency and pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Compromise Language:**  We're framing this as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.

This approach aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while keeping the John option open if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm ready to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum for this product. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to seriously consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches John's guaranteed price. There's no longer a financial incentive to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **""Absolute Maximum"":** Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to go any higher.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures the guaranteed amount.

While there's a slim chance Bob might offer slightly more in further rounds, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing him and having to accept John's offer anyway."
