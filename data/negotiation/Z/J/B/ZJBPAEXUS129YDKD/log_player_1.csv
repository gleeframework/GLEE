Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $80, which is your floor.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, but still leaves room for you to profit. 
* **Reasonable:**  A $5 discount from Bob's perceived value is a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is more than your minimum of $80, it's still below the $95 you initially offered. You're aiming to maximize your profit, and rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
