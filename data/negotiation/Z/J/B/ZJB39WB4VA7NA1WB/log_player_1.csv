Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While Bob is getting closer, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident I can get him to my minimum price of $80.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob."
