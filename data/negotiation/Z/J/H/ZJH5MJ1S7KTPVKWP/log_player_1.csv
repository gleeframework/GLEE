Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($120), I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer.
