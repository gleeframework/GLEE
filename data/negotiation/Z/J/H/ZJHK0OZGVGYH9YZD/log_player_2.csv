"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good starting point, but $950,000 is still pretty high considering my max budget is $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see where Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit out of my range right now.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a significant amount and reflects my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to maintain a higher price point to ensure the product's value is reflected. Considering our previous offer and counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is better than $950,000, it's still a bit high. I'll try to bring it down further by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still above my current comfort zone.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair and reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the product's value. Considering our previous offers and counteroffers, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $875000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a premium warranty and a personalized consultation session. This package is worth $25000, so I'm effectively offering the product to you for $850000. This is a unique opportunity for you to own this product and get additional value on top of the purchase price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is great. While I'm not thrilled about the ""perks"" (I don't really need them), the $850,000 price is right in my range, and it's worth avoiding further negotiation. I'm happy to accept."
