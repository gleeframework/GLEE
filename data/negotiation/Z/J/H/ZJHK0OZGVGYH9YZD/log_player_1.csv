Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950000 is a bit out of my range right now.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is a significant amount and reflects my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to maintain a higher price point to ensure the product's value is reflected.

This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product."", ""product_price"": 875000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $850000.  This is a fair and reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.

Round 5

Considering our previous offers and counteroffers, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a premium warranty and a personalized consultation session. This package is worth $25,000, so I'm effectively offering the product to you for $850,000.
