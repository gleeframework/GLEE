Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting high allows you to potentially gain an extra $300,000. 
* **Emphasizing value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond, opening the door for potential counter-offers. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, there's always a risk Bob might reject a high offer. You'll need to decide your risk tolerance. If you want to guarantee a sale, a price closer to $1,200,000 would be safer."
