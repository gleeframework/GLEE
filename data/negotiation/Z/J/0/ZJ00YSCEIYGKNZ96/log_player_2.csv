Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000.  I'm willing to accept this price because I believe in the value it will bring you.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's position:** Alice has clearly stated her minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000. She seems firm on this.
* **Your limit:** Your absolute maximum is $1,000,000. 
* **No room for negotiation:** There's no overlap between what you're willing to pay and Alice's minimum. Further counteroffers are unlikely to succeed.
* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, meeting your budget.

Continuing to negotiate with Alice is pointless in this scenario. You'd be better off securing the product from John at your desired price."
