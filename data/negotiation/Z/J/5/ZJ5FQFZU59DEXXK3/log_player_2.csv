{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  I can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. I'm interested, but I'd like to start with a price of $9,000 to see if we can find common ground.  Let's discuss."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I would like to propose a price of $9,300 for the product. This reflects a compromise while still allowing us to maintain a fair valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. Accepting her offer at $9,300 saves me $700 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price is not worth it."
