Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a better offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $11,000?  I'm flexible, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. It's still below my ideal price, but $10,750 is a decent compromise. I'd rather sell to Bob than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $15,000."
