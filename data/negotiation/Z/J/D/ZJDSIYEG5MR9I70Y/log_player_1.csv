Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,180,000? This price reflects the value it will bring to your business."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $1,080,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob is consistently moving upward, and we're getting close to a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of him walking away.  $1,080,000 is a strong profit, and accepting now secures the deal."
