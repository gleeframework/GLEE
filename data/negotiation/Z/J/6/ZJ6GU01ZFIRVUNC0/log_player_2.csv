Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting further apart, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $110 for the product. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $80, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unwilling to meet your maximum price.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $80, ensuring you stay within your budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better deal for you."
