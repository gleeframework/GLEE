"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $180 for it. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $120 for the product. What do you think, Bob?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we try $75?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting further apart, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I have a firm budget. If you're willing to come down to $80, I'm ready to buy right now.  Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $80, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,7,
