"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $1500000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not convinced it's worth the full $1500000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000, which is a significant reduction from the original price. I'm open to further discussion and willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be confident that the product is a good investment for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1200000 is a fair price, I'm not quite ready to accept it just yet. Given the product's unique capabilities and potential, I believe $1350000 is a more realistic price point. I'm confident that this offer is still attractive while respecting your budget constraints. Let's continue this conversation to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, which would be $1275000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1275000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1312500. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges both the product's value and your budget constraints. I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1312500. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000 again, which is the midpoint between $1200000 and $1312500. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
