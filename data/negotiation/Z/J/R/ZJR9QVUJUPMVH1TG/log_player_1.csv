Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob is clearly interested but trying to lowball at this point.  We still have room to negotiate and are aiming for a much higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  However, there's a significant gap between $1,100,000 and my minimum. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to make one more move down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer; let me know if it works for you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other interested buyers, but that price is still a stretch for me.  If you're willing to meet me at $1,250,000, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

This is a good deal!  Bob is moving closer to our desired price and is now above our guaranteed sale price with John.  It's best to accept and close the deal."
