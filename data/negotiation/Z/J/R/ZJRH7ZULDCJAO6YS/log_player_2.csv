"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $10,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above the $8,000 he can get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as there's a good chance she'll accept something closer to Bob's preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $9,200 is still outside of Bob's ideal price range.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid the further negotiation with Alice."
