"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for cheaper from John.  While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but my budget is a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8500 is a good offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $9000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to compromise a little and meet you halfway at $8750. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $8,750 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a lower price from John.  It's worth it to continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll lower her price further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the need to sell.  Let's make a deal!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Although Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  He's already negotiated quite a bit and it's unlikely Alice will go any lower.  It's better to secure the product for his budget from John rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to another buyer."
