"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8500 is a good offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $9000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to compromise a little and meet you halfway at $8750. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $8750 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8250. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
