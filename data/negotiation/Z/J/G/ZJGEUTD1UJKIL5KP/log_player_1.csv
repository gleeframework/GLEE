Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'd find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,190,000, as I know how much value it can bring to your specific situation."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to the product's value to me ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up a little, increasing my profit.
* **Highlight Value to Bob:**  Emphasizing the product's benefits specifically relevant to Bob aims to justify the high price and make it more appealing. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives me a strong position. I don't need to go below this price.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, it's the best strategy to potentially maximize profit while still having John as a backup option."
