"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still reasonable.  It leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring I get a good return on my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm  lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate but staying above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer, and while it's still not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
