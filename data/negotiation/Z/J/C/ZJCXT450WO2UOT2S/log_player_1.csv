"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a rare opportunity and I believe it's a great value for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, even though I don't know his specific needs. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting high, I create space for counteroffers and negotiations.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. My next move will depend on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is a significant reduction from my initial price, it's still lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** At this stage, selling to John for $1,000,000 would be less profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offering but still reflecting Bob's interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, I can't go as low as $1,400,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product at $1,700,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your interest. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's a compromise, reflecting Bob's interest while staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a justification for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm aiming to close the deal in this round. I'm hoping that Bob will find my counteroffer reasonable and accept it. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer and adapt my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I'll need to carefully consider my options and potential further counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,500,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I want to secure a price closer to $1,700,000.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to bridge the remaining gap. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be less profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob. I have time and several rounds left, so there's still a good chance to get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum. I will also reiterate the value of the product and try to find a point where we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and my desire to work with you.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down to $1,600,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce its worth and justify the price.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that both of us can benefit from the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  If he rejects again, I'll need to consider adjusting my strategy. If he accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1600000, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1550000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Continues:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  There's still room for negotiation and I want to push for a better deal. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a significant loss compared to what I'm aiming for with Bob.  With several rounds left, the potential for a higher offer is still high.
* **Staying Persistent:**  By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to continue negotiating until we reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming for a compromise between $1,600,000 and $1,550,000.  I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and highlight the potential for a successful partnership."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,575,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your commitment to acquiring it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer of $1,550,000 and my previous offer of $1,600,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and signals a desire to close the deal.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing my offer as fair and mutually beneficial, highlighting the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's perspective.
* **Focus on Closing the Deal:**  I'm expressing confidence that this price point will be acceptable to Bob and lead to a successful agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  If he rejects again, I'll need to consider making a final offer or potentially selling to John if the remaining rounds are limited. However, I remain optimistic that this offer will be enough to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1575000, but I'm still a bit below that price. I'm willing to pay $1570000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,570,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is still slightly below my initial target, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,575,000.
* **Limited Time:**  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing.  
* **Profitable Outcome:** Selling to Bob at $1,570,000 is still significantly more profitable than selling to John for $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a profitable deal. Even though it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome given the circumstances and time constraints."
