Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The offered price of $1,150,000 is just slightly below the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000), incentivizing him to seriously consider the deal. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. You have the flexibility to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial ask and what the product is worth to him. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to its true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but my initial offer reflected the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your first offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** $1,100,000 is a significant amount above your guaranteed sale price to John, making it a worthwhile pursuit to continue negotiations with Bob. 
* **Gauging Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help you understand how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and if he's willing to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  Bob's latest offer of $1,075,000 is a significant increase from his initial offer and a reasonable compromise. It reflects a $75,000 gain from your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob. Accepting now secures a good deal without further delays.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you could hold out for a slightly higher price from Bob, there's always the risk he walks away. Accepting this offer ensures you don't lose the sale entirely."
