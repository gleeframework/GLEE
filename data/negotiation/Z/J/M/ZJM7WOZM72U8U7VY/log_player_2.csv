"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and negotiating is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer significantly lowers the price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiating. 
* **Target Price:** While lower than Bob's maximum budget, it still leaves room for potential concessions.
* **Building Momentum:** This move shows Alice that Bob is willing to walk away, potentially putting pressure on her to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his target price.  
* **Negotiation Advantage:** Bob has already shown a willingness to walk away, so he can potentially negotiate a lower price in the next round.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Choosing to buy from John now would secure the product but leave no opportunity to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is Bob's final offer, matching his maximum budget. 
* **Pressure Point:** Alice has rejected multiple counteroffers.  It's likely she will be more motivated to accept a price closer to Bob's budget, especially if she sees him willing to walk away. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** While this is Bob's maximum, there's still room for a slight compromise if Alice is determined to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still a bit higher.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. There's a chance she might be willing to come down even further, especially if she wants to avoid a deal with John.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While Bob could buy from John now and save time, there's still the potential to save $25,000 by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 810000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Concession:** This counteroffer represents a slight concession from Bob's previous offer of $800,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Pressure on Alice:** This counteroffer puts more pressure on Alice to accept. She knows Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000, and this offer is a good middle ground.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While this is a concession, Bob is still holding out for a lower price, which is important since he has the option to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only three rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting tight.
* **Little Room for Improvement:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll drop the price significantly enough in the next two rounds to make it worthwhile.
* **Guaranteeing the Deal:** Buying from John now guarantees Bob gets the product at his maximum budget.  While he might be able to save a little more by continuing to negotiate, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice outweighs the potential savings."
