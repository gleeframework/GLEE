"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great price, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a compromise to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's in your best interest to see if Alice will lower her price further or stick with buying from John."
