"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's a good deal for Bob, he can potentially get an even better price by counteroffering. There's a significant difference between Alice's valuation ($1,200,000) and the maximum Bob is willing to pay ($1,500,000), leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the lowest price possible, so he's starting with a significantly lower counteroffer. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and potentially leads to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is still a good deal for Bob, he's closer to his target price of $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to keep pushing for a lower price. There's still a chance Alice will come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been pushing for a lower price, but Alice has shown willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway. It is a good deal for both parties, as it is higher than Alice's valuation and lower than Bob's maximum price. This is likely to be accepted by Alice, leading to a successful negotiation."
