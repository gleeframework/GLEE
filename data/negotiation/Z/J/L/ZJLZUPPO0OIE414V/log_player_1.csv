Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to me and $8,000 to him. This gives him a good deal while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.  I'm hoping he accepts, but I'm prepared to negotiate further or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm hopeful he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum value, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
