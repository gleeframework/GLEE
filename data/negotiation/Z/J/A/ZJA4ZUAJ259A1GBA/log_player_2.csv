"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He's willing to pay up to $120, and Alice values it at $80. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm making a fair profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price,  $105 is still a bit higher than what he's hoping to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob is willing to continue the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows he is willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price. This approach increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm getting a bit closer to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's getting closer to his maximum of $120, he still has room to negotiate a better deal. Continuing to negotiate may lead to a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really want to make this deal work, but $110 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $102.50. This is my final offer, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show commitment:**  Bob is stating this is his final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Compromise:**  Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer, showing willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Target price:** Bob is still aiming for a price below his $120 maximum, aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $102.50. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to meet me there, we can make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Max:** Alice's offer of $115 is close to Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Limited Rounds:** Only 3 rounds left, increasing the risk of not reaching a deal.
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** Bob could try a final counteroffer at $110, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept.

The risk of not closing a deal and having to buy from John for $120 outweighs the potential benefit of trying to negotiate further. It's better for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product."
