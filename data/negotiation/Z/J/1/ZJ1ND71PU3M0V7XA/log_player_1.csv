Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price slightly but not too much, as I can always sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Power:** I still have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to be firm and try to squeeze out a better deal with Bob.
* **Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum, increasing my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows flexibility while maintaining a good profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I continue to use a friendly and encouraging tone to foster a positive negotiating environment.
* **Justification:** I provide a brief justification for my counteroffer, making it appear more reasonable.
* **Closing Statement:**  I end with a strong call to action, urging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  $95 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Upward Potential:** Bob has shown a reluctance to significantly increase his offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John provides a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since I'm unlikely to get a much better price."
