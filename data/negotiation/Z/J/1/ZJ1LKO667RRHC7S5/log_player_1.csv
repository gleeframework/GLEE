"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $80 to Bob, so there's potential for us to find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $80. Would you consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try and push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  How about that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. I would like to propose $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum price, and it's better than selling to John for the same price.  There's no need to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
