"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to negotiate a better price. Can you meet me at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is at least $1000000, and I want to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $980000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. Can you consider this offer?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I can offer it to you for $1000000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
