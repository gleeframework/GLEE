"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product goes beyond that figure. I'm confident that its unique benefits will bring you significant returns.  I can come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Considering its potential and the market, I believe $1,300,000 is a fair compromise. This price allows us both to benefit from the deal and avoids any further back-and-forth.  Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
