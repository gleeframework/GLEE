{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation and still provides me with a decent profit. I'm also framing it in a positive way, highlighting the value Bob will get from the product.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value, but it's close enough that it's worth accepting. I'm not keen on taking the risk of further negotiation, as there's a chance he'll back out, or I might end up selling to John for less than this.  $9,000 is a decent profit, and I'd rather secure the deal now."
