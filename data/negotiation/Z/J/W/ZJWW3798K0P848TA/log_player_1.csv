Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible. Offering it at $95 attempts to maximize profit while still being enticing for Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed buyer at $100, so I don't want to go below that.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price higher than $80."
