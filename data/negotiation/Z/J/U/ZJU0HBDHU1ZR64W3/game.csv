"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1300000 is still more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm happy to pay $1100000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1250000. I think this product is worth every penny of that amount. Can you meet me in the middle again?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product. However, $1250000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go to $1200000 as my final offer.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
