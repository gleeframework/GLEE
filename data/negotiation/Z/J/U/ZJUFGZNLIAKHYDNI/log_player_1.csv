"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully. While it's significantly lower than my initial ask, it's still more than John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
