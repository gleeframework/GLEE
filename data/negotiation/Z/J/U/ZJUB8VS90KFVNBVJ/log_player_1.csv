"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while also showing that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating with him. There are still rounds left, and I can try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13,500 for it. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet halfway, and I think we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. While it's still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to accept it to avoid risking losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same amount."
