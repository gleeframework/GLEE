"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $12,000.  He offers $12,500, a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in purchasing the product while also expressing his financial limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move the product while still making a reasonable profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum willingness to pay.  At this point, Bob realizes that further negotiations with Alice might not yield a price he's comfortable with.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget, avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential higher prices."
