Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 offer:**  This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Enthusiastic message:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer and keeps the negotiation going. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but I'm open to negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer myself.  I'll always be aware of John's $15,000 offer as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob become too unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my target, I'm still not willing to settle for anything below $15,000.  
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation:**  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.
* **John's offer is a valuable safety net:** If negotiations with Bob continue to be unsuccessful, I have a guaranteed $15,000 sale with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move the product while still making a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  The $13,500 price point leaves room for further negotiation while keeping my profit margin in mind. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, acknowledging Bob's budget while emphasizing my need for a reasonable price. This fosters a sense of collaboration and increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Positive Language:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
