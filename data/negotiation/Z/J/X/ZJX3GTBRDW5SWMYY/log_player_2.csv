"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $12,000 for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still significantly higher than his $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, so Bob can continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $10,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it's the highest I can go at this time."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. To further accommodate your situation while ensuring a fair return for our product, I propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. $10,000 is still more than his $8,000 limit. He has already shown that he is willing to negotiate and is prepared to reject offers that are too high. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. It is still early in the negotiation process, and there are several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be fair here.  $10,000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  This is the most I can pay, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our ongoing dialogue and understanding your financial constraints, I am willing to adjust my offer to $9,800 for the product. This represents a compromise that acknowledges the value you see in it while also reflecting the current market conditions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is still above Bob's $8,000 limit.  While there are a few rounds left, the negotiations seem to be at a stalemate. Bob has already rejected multiple offers and is sticking to his counteroffer of $9,500. Alice is also holding firm on her counteroffer. 

At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will result in minimal price reductions.  Given that Bob can purchase the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense for him to accept this offer and secure the product at the lowest possible price. This decision minimizes his risk of getting stuck in an endless negotiation loop without a deal."
