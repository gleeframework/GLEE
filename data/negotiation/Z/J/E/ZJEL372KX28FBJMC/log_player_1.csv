Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects its potential value to me while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
