"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the value I'm placing on this product and is fair to both of us. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $862,500. Can you consider this counteroffer?",862500.0,Bob,4,
