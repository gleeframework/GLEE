Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
