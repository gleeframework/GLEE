"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will be enticed by the offer and accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I have 9 rounds left, so I still have time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. I'm willing to take a small loss at this point, but I'm not desperate enough to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to consider selling to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable, but I'm not going to give up yet.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can still get a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that we're both trying to get the best deal here. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair compromise that allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can call it a day."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses.  I've already gone down significantly from my initial asking price, and Bob isn't budging.  It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the best I can do at this point."
