"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. ",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make a deal!",102.5,Alice,5,
