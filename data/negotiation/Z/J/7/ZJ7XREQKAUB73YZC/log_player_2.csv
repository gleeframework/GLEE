"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $80 to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still too high, and Bob has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within his budget. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear starting point.  $90 is a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price even closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly, but still keeping it below $100.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $102.50 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  While it's a slight improvement, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  At this point, buying from John for $80 is the most financially beneficial option, as it guarantees a price within Bob's budget."
