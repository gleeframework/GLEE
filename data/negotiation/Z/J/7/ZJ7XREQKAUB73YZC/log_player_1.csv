"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $80 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I have 9 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $120.  I'm going to keep negotiating. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 102.50}
