"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth $12,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  I'm offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her value of $8,000. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Be polite:**  Maintaining a friendly tone will keep the negotiation open and prevent it from becoming adversarial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I can likely get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering again. 

I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation since I can still potentially get a better price than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm really eager to get this product, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between her last offer and my previous one. This shows I'm willing to meet her halfway.
* **Show eagerness:**  Mentioning my eagerness to buy keeps the negotiation positive and implies I'm close to accepting.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  Continuing the friendly communication helps keep the door open for a successful deal."
