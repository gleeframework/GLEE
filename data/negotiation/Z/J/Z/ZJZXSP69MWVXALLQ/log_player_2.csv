"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this valuable product and I know you'd be a great fit for it. I'm thinking of a price around $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to leave room for negotiation.  A significantly lower counter-offer lets Alice know we're serious about getting a better price.
* **Respectful Tone:**  We maintain a polite and professional tone to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer is still well above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000), giving us room to negotiate upward if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is negotiating, but her counter-offer of $10,500 is still quite high. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have time to negotiate further and try to get closer to our target price.
* **John as Backup:** Remember, we can always buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations stall or become unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? "",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between our previous offer ($9,000) and her counter-offer ($10,500). 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We keep the negotiation moving by proposing a concrete price.
* **Approaching Our Limit:**  We are getting closer to our upper limit, but there's still a buffer between this offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $10,100? I'm trying to be flexible but need to get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Movement:**  Alice only came down $400 from her last offer.  This suggests she might be getting close to her bottom line, but there's still room to negotiate.
* **Time Considerations:**  We're halfway through the rounds, so we can afford to push a little further. A firm rejection might encourage Alice to make a more significant move next round.
* **John Option:** We're still within a reasonable range of John's price, so the backup plan remains viable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $9,750 is really the most I can justify spending on this product. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer reiterates our previous price while expressing a sense of urgency and a desire to finalize the deal.
* **Limited Flexibility:**  We indicate that this is our final offer, putting the ball in Alice's court to decide if she wants to accept a price within a reasonable range or risk losing the sale.
* **Alternative Option:** By emphasizing our readiness to close, we subtly remind Alice of our option to buy from John if an agreement isn't reached soon."
