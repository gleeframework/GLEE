Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $9,750 is really the most I can justify spending on this product. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob seems firm on his $9,750 offer, and while it's not ideal, it's significantly more than John's $8,000 offer.  Continuing to push for a higher price might result in losing Bob altogether."
