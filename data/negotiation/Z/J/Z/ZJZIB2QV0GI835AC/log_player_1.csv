Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe in its value and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I know Bob values the product at $8,000, my goal is to get as close to my own valuation of $10,000 as possible. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I have the security of John as a buyer who will pay my minimum acceptable price. This means I can confidently aim high with Bob.
* **Direct Approach:**  I'm being upfront about the price, as haggling could potentially lower Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation tactics.  A more nuanced approach might be necessary with additional information."
