Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without explicitly stating your minimum, making Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies you have other options and might not hold the offer open indefinitely, subtly encouraging Bob to act fast.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value of $12,000. There's a chance he'll reject any offer above that.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can always decrease your asking price, but avoid going below your $15,000 safety net."
