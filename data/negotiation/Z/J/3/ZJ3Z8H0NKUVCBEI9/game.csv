"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
