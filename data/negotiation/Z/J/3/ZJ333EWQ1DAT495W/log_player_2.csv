Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I can do $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, though.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum price than to risk Alice sticking to her offer and forcing you to accept a higher price or walk away."
