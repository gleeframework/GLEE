"Alice, that's a beautiful product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I can do $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, though.",850000.0,Alice,5,
