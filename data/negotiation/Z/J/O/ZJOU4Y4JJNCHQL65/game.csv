"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a valuable product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
