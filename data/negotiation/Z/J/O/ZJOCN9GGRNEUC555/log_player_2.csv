You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's best to counteroffer and see if Alice will come down in price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $17,000 is still significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer of $15,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he's already stated that he's not willing to go higher.  John is offering the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best option for him."
