"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  However, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time. Would you be open to considering a price closer to $10,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference again and go with $13,500. This would give you a solid price while staying within my budget. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $13,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to accept $15,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,5,
