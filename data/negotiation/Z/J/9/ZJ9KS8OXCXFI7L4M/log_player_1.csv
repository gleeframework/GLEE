Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible without losing the sale. By offering it at $1,350,000:
    * You leave some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
    * You secure a significant profit of $350,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's exact walk-away price.  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer, but this approach balances risk and potential reward."
