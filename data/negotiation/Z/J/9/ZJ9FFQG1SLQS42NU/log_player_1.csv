Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000,  meaning there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price above your minimum. 

**Important:**  This strategy aims to maximize your profit. However, be prepared to adjust your approach if Bob outright rejects your initial offer. You can always negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price."
