"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I've also included a friendly message to make the interaction more positive and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $92.50 is a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. That's a fair price for us both, considering your value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price."", ""product_price"": 90}
