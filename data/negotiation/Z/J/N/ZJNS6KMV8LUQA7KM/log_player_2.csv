"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. He's also expressing his interest in the product to make Alice more likely to consider the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is closer to Bob's maximum price of $80, it's still above his preferred range. He can try to negotiate further and potentially get closer to $85, which was his previous counteroffer.  Furthermore, rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of buying from John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $92.50 is a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. That's a fair price for us both, considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's closer to Alice's previous offer, but still within his preferred range. He's also emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's preferred price range, it still exceeds his maximum of $80.  At this point, Bob has been negotiating for a few rounds, and it's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go lower than $90.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, as it guarantees him the product at his desired price."
