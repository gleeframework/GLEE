"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12500 yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $14000. This is as low as I can go.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $13000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
