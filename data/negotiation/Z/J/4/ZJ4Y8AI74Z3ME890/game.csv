"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially worth much more than $1000000.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial price, but I believe it reflects the potential of this product.  If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.  Think about it, and let me know your decision. ",1500000.0,Alice,1,
