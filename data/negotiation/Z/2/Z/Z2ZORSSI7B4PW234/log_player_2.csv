"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for me. This unique item is not just a commodity; it's a testament to craftsmanship and innovation, tailored to elevate your lifestyle or business to unparalleled heights. I believe its worth far exceeds its tangible value, making it a true investment in excellence.

Considering the exceptional quality and the potential it holds, I am extending a special offer to you. For a limited time, I am willing to sell this product to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, reflecting my desire to find the right person who appreciates its true worth and can fully utilize its capabilities.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product. I am more than happy to provide additional information to help you make an informed decision.

Looking forward to your response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or explore other options."
