"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking to get closer to my original asking price.  How about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is now offering it for $13,500. This is a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, lowering her price from $14,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price reductions.
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects the offer and continues negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to sell or even increase her price. 

Overall, accepting Alice's offer of $13,500 represents a good balance between saving money and minimizing the risk of losing out on the deal."
