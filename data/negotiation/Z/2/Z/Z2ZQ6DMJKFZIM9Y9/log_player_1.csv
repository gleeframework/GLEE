Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,000 is lower than Bob's value of $15,000, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth if Bob wants to counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking to get closer to my original asking price.  How about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $13,500. This keeps the negotiations moving forward and gives Bob a reasonable offer to consider."
