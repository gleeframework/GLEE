While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'll try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:

Alice's final offer is still higher than my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned about the risk of going back and forth and ultimately not getting the product.  John is offering the product for my maximum budget, and I'm comfortable with that."
