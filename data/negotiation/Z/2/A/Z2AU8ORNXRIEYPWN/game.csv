"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This offers a significant profit for you and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $950,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,000,000. This would still allow you a very good profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm not ready to give up on a higher price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's worth it for the profit I'll make. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
