"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still plenty of room for both of us to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This offers a significant profit for you and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $950,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better offer than the first round, it's still above my desired price range. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,000,000. This would still allow you a very good profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm not ready to give up on a higher price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's worth it for the profit I'll make. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is close to my initial counteroffer of $950,000. While I would prefer to pay less, the potential risk of further negotiation and ultimately having to buy from John for $1,500,000 makes this offer acceptable. It's a good deal for both of us and allows me to save a significant amount compared to John's price."
