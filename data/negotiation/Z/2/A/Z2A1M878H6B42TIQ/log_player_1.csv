Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation if needed.  It's also a good starting point as it's less than Bob's perceived value of the product. This should encourage him to negotiate, but hopefully, we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is a good price, I'm confident I can get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer at $110. This is still a decent price for Bob, and it's closer to my desired price point. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this price."
