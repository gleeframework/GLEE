"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to pay. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
