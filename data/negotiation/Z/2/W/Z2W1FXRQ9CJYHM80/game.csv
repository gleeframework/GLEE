"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $650,000 is far below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $775,000? This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal!",775000.0,Alice,5,
