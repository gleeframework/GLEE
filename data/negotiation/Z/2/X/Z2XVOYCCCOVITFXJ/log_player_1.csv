Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement. How about we consider the product priced at $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, and I would like to propose a price of $1325000. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd like to push for more, I need to balance that with the risk of Bob walking away or me losing time to John. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit while minimizing the chance of a failed negotiation."
