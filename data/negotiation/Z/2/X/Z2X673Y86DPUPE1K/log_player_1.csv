This offer is a starting point. I'm hoping to get close to my minimum value while still being appealing to Bob.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation in case Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? It's still a great price, and I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

I'm still not happy with $9,800, but I'm willing to give Bob one more chance. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but still higher than my minimum."

I've reached my limit with Bob.  While his offer is getting closer, it's still not close enough to my minimum value.  I'd rather sell the product to John for a much better price."
