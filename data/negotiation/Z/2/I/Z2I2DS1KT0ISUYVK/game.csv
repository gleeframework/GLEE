"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with the price of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,6,
