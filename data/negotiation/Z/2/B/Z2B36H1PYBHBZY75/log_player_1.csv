It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profit:**  While $16,000 is less than your ideal price, it's still a $1,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob is firmly rooted at $16,000.  Continuing to push might alienate him and risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating is an opportunity cost. Accepting now allows you to move on to other potential deals."
