Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth a substantial investment.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the potential benefits and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is not a terrible price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This acknowledges the value you see in the product while still allowing me a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the potential benefits and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $975,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the potential benefits and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my ideal price, I've only got 4 rounds left. The risk of not closing a deal with Bob is increasing.  I'm confident I can get a better price from him, but the pressure is mounting. I think it's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. It's a safe bet, and it guarantees I won't walk away with nothing."
