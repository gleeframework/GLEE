{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special discounted price of $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this offer stands before I move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $10,000, getting Bob to buy it for slightly less still earns a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it at $9,500 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a firm offer, the slightly higher price leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still keeping the price above our minimum."
