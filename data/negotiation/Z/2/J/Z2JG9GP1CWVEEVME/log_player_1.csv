Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  I want to maximize my earnings, and there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than $800,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Starting high gives me leverage in negotiations. If Bob rejects, I can always go back to John, who will pay my minimum. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
