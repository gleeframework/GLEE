,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $12000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $16000. This still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up a bit. I'm still a bit away from your offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's settle at $15500.
