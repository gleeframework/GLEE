"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $12,000 right now.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow me to get the product within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $14,500.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,
