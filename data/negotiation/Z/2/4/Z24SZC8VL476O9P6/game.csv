"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $8000.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8000. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
