``` 

This offer is slightly below my minimum value of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point, and I can always lower the price a bit if necessary. I'm keeping John in mind as a fallback option, but I'm hoping to strike a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price closer to my value. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, so let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point.  I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I get the minimum value I'm looking for."
