"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good starting point, it's still above my maximum budget of $150.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial discount.  However, $95 is still a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $85? This is a reasonable increase from the original $95, but still leaves room for negotiation. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer. It's a good deal for me, and further negotiation might risk losing the opportunity altogether."
