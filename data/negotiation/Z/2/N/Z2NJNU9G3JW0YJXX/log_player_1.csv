Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial discount.  However, $95 is still a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
