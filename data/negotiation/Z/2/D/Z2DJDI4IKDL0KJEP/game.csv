"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you meeting me some of the way.  While I agree this product has value, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
