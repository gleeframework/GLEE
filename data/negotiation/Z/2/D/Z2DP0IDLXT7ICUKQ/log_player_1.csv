Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a guaranteed $8,000 from John, so we're not desperate. This lets us be firm in our pricing."
