"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, it's always worth exploring if you can get it for even less.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a $50,000 discount. This should start the negotiation process and give Alice some room to bargain. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is within my target range.  While I'd love to get it even lower, accepting this offer allows me to secure a decent deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation. I have 7 rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee I can get a better price. It's important to balance the desire for a lower price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
