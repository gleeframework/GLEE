"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a lot to me. My initial offer is $1800000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,800,000 seems a bit steep.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer. I'll try to negotiate a better price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with given the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need at least $1650000 to consider it.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit higher than I'd like, but it's closer to what I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down a bit more. Since Alice's new offer is $165,000, I'll offer $155,000, which is still a bit lower than her latest offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,650,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,650,000, which would be $1,575,000. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 1575000}"
