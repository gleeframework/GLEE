"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This remarkable item holds immense value to me, but I understand its true worth to you is even greater at $1,500,000. My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you at a price that reflects its true value while also ensuring a fair return for me. I kindly suggest a price of $1,200,000.

This offer includes all the features and benefits you've been seeking, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement that respects the significance of this product to both of us.

Please let me know if you require any further information or have questions about the product. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Alice
