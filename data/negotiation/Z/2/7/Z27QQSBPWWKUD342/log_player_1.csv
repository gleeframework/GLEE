Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you given the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is higher than Bob's $12,000 value, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  $14,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This offer leaves space for both you and Bob to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

By starting with this offer, you create a dynamic where Bob has an incentive to negotiate with you rather than immediately rejecting your offer and going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I cannot accept an offer that would result in a substantial loss for me.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and attempt to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this work for both of us.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I receive a price that is acceptable to me.
* **Justification:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and emphasizes that the $13,000 price is still a good deal for him.
* **Negotiation leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to either accept or propose another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer of $11,000.  It's also a good compromise that meets Bob halfway, indicating he's serious about buying the product.  Given that I can always sell to John for $15,000, accepting Bob's offer at $12,500 ensures I close a deal and avoid further negotiations."
