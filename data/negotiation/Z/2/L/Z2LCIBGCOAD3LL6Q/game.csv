"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
