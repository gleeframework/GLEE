"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $120 maximum.  He's shown willingness to negotiate, but not conceding too much in the first counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $135 is still within Bob's budget of $150, and it's closer to his ideal price.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might walk away, leaving him to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time:** Accepting the offer saves time and avoids further negotiation rounds.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point, balancing value and minimizing risk."
