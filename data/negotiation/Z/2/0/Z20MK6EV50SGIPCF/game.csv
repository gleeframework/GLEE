"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the $1,100,000 offer falls significantly short of the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a firm offer, reflecting the considerable worth this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I'm willing to move a bit further to $1,850,000. This price reflects a significant reduction on my part and takes us close to a fair deal.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $1,850,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm offering $1,450,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
