Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet at $770,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $780,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can we finalize the deal at this price?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unwilling to budge below $780,000. While closer to your desired price, it's still above your backup option of buying from John for $800,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best possible price."
