"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $12,500? This would give you a significant discount on its true worth while ensuring I get a fair deal.",12500.0,Alice,1,
