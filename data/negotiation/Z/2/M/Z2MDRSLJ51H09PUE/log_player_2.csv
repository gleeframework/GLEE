"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your ideal price point. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. It shows you are serious about buying the product but also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell the product for $110. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counter-offer is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what you'd like to pay. You have more rounds left and the option to buy from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle -  I'll offer you $105 for it. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is still lower than Alice's offer, but it shows you're willing to compromise and meet her halfway. It also keeps you closer to your ideal price point."
