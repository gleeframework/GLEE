Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and features. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the price. While $18,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $20,000? This still reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $17,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a reasonable price. However, we're still significantly above his perceived value of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, and holding out for a bit longer might yield a better result than immediately going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $19,000? That's my final offer, and I think it's a very fair price for a product of this quality."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $19,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $18,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and is incrementally increasing his offer. While we're still below our initial target, $18,750 represents a significant profit above both Bob's perceived value and our guaranteed offer from John. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
