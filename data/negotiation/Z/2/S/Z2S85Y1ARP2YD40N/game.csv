"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own something that's worth a lot to you, Bob. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget. How about we start the conversation at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we try something around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I feel like we are getting closer.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to do it for $8,000?  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about we meet in the middle of my minimum and your offer at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,7,
