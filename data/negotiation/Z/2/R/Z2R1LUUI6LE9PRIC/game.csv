"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. ",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $1,350,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both agree on this final figure.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,380,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll be getting a great deal at this price.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
