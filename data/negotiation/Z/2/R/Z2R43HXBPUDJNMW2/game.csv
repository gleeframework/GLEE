"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low. It's not even close to the value I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects a significant discount and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop to $8,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
