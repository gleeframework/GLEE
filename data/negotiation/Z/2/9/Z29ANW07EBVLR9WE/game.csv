"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
