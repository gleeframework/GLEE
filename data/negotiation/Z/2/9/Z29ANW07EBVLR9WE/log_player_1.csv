Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want to start high, a price of $1,100,000 is still within a potentially reasonable range for Bob, considering his perceived value is $800,000. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing you to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum:** $900,000 is substantially less than your $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a considerable gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** You have a strong alternative with John, which allows you to confidently reject Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,050,000."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility but Hold Firm:**  We are moving down from our initial offer to signal willingness to negotiate, but not by a large amount. This maintains a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Strategic Concession:** A drop of $50,000 is significant enough to be enticing to Bob but small enough to keep us well above our minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true value,"" we reinforce the idea that our price is tied to the product's worth, not just arbitrary negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Progress:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, but his price increments are small. It's unlikely he'll reach your minimum in a reasonable time frame.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of losing time and potentially a better deal with John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

While there's a chance Bob might eventually offer more, the slow pace of negotiation and the guaranteed sale to John make selling to John the most logical choice at this point."
