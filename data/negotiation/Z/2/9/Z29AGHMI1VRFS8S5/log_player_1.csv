While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,775,000 is a good business decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  The offer is still $275,000 above my baseline of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to frustration on both sides and potentially risk the deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Prolonging the negotiation prevents me from pursuing other opportunities. 

Accepting this offer provides a strong return and allows me to move forward."
