"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's actually more than what I'm willing to pay John for the product. I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my actual maximum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  I want to maintain a positive tone and show Alice I'm genuinely interested in the product, even though her initial price is too high.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""closer to $60"" implies I'm willing to move a bit on price, encouraging Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $60 is quite low, but I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $90 is still above my budget and what I'm willing to pay John.  I need to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about $70? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm moving closer to my maximum price ($80) but staying firm in my negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""ready to close the deal right now,"" I'm adding a bit of pressure, hoping Alice will see this as a good opportunity to sell.
* **Fairness:**  I'm reiterating that my offer is fair, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of finding a reasonable deal."
