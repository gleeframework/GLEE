"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can exceed your expectations.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your proposal. While I agree the product has potential, I believe the price point needs adjustment. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to move a bit, how about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer to a middle ground.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind and while I see the value in this product, $1,250,000 still stretches it a bit. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for me as well.  $1,225,000 is my final offer - it reflects the true value of the product. I'm open to discussing alternative payment terms if that would be helpful.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your understanding and willingness to be flexible. I'm also keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,200,000?  I'm open to hearing about those alternative payment terms you mentioned. Perhaps we can find an arrangement there that adds value for you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
