"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in your product, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This price is still within your profit range and represents a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
