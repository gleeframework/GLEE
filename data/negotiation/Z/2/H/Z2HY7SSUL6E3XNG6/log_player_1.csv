Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000.  I'd like to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for both of us to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer:

This represents a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.
