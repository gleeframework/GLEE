Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair market value, but I believe the product is worth more than that.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the value I know you place on this product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is still within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice will not go lower. Accepting this offer allows you to purchase the product for a reasonable price and avoid the risk of further negotiations falling through or having to buy from John at a higher price."
