"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $100 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I can potentially get closer to my desired $95 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $88.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good saving."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $88 is still a bit too high for me. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is closer to my minimum, I still want to try and push for a bit higher price. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $85 is still just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $86.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 86.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $86.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about $84? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, selling to John for $80 is the best option to ensure I make at least my minimum profit."
