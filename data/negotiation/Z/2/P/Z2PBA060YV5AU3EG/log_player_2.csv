Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's above his maximum budget, and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 for it.  What do you say?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his ideal price point. He can try to negotiate further or buy from John for a guaranteed $15,000."
