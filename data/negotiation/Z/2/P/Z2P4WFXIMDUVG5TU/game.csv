"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  Let's get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $975,000.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,012,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
