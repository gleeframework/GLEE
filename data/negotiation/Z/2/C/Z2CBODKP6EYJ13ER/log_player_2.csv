{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer. You can do better than $11,000, and it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You're still well within your budget, and rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

Alice is consistently increasing the price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You have a few rounds left and still have a good chance of getting a better deal. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and puts pressure on Alice to come down in price.  You're still comfortably within your budget."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

You're getting closer to Alice's price, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  You're showing that you're serious about buying the product but still committed to getting a good deal. You're also leaving enough room to potentially counteroffer if Alice rejects this offer.  You're still well within your budget, and with only a few rounds left, you need to start moving toward a final agreement."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is continuing to raise her price, and you only have one round left. You're getting closer to your budget, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept your final offer. 

Instead of risking a last-minute failure, you should buy from John.  You'll pay a bit more than you hoped, but you'll get the product and avoid the chance of a frustrating stalemate."
