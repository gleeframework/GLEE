"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can try to get a better price from Alice since her offer is higher than our ideal price and significantly higher than her own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer that's beneficial to me (matching Alice's valuation).  While she might not accept it immediately, it sets a strong anchor for further negotiation.
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important in negotiations to encourage a good working relationship. 
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm stating my desired price upfront to avoid any ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price I'm willing to accept, but it's still above my target.  It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down further before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate that, Alice, and I do think it's a good product. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling willingness to compromise by moving closer to her price while still aiming for a price below my maximum. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and encourages her to reciprocate with a similar concession.
* **Still Below My Limit:** This offer keeps me well within my budget and leaves room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close, Bob! But I was thinking more like $125. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down considerably, and $125 is a reasonable price, saving me $25 off John's offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I push further and Alice walks away, I'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but at this point, the potential savings are probably not worth the additional time and effort."
