"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in further discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good deal for Bob. I believe it is a fair price considering he is willing to pay $950,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm hoping to get a better deal from Bob, or I'll be forced to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will accept as it's getting closer to his last offer.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, and I'm not sure how many more rounds I can afford to lose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is getting uncomfortably close to my minimum, I'm not ready to give up yet.  I still have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal from Bob.  I need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to risk before turning to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering a price of $950,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob before I have to turn to John.  The risk is high, but I'm willing to gamble to avoid losing out on a potential sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, but it's clear that we are not going to be able to reach an agreement.  Bob's offer of $825,000 is too low for me to accept.   I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiations and potentially lose out on a better offer.  John is a guaranteed sale, even though it's not my ideal price."
