"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is fair, considering the value you've placed on the product yourself.  Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I still think the product is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product yourself. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
