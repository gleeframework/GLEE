"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's beneficial to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value"" of the product, you're trying to frame the price in a positive light, even though it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it provides, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer represents his perceived value, it's far below your minimum.  You have plenty of room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to your target. Selling to John is a last resort if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly lower than what I can accept for this product. It holds real value and I'm confident you'd find it useful. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can feel like a compromise to both parties. While it's your actual bottom line, framing it as a middle ground might encourage Bob to engage further. 
* **Firm but Fair:** You're clearly stating your minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for Bob to potentially counter with a slightly higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm unable to meet the current price of $120. Could we perhaps aim for $95 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, $95 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and still provides you with a profit.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations might not yield a much better outcome. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potentially losing both Bob and John. 
* **Bird in Hand:**  There's always a risk Bob could walk away in subsequent rounds. Accepting a reasonable offer now mitigates that risk."
