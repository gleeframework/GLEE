"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $150, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $150 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $157.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product at that price.",157.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $157.50 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $160. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know what you think!",160.0,Alice,5,
