{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd receive from another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a good starting point. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still gives Bob a significant discount compared to his valuation of $800,000. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefit to both of us. 
* This initial offer allows for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob to his limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give the product away at such a low price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000,  which is a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle on this. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
