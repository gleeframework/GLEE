"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $100.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, meeting in the middle at $110. 
* **Value:** $110 is still within Bob's budget of $120 and offers a decent saving compared to John's offer. 
* **Time:** Accepting avoids further rounds of negotiation, potentially risking a stalemate or losing the opportunity to John.

While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the product to John or failing to reach a deal within the 10 rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
