"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,350,000? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is closer to the mark, I need to get at least $1,550,000 for this product.  This is a very competitive price.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
