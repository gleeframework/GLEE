Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I see the value you're placing on it,  $18,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I could consider coming down to $20,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $20,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000.  While getting closer to John's offer, we have room to negotiate and entice Bob further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  Let's try to bridge this gap. How about we settle at $19,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers, indicating serious interest. Accepting $17,000 provides a $2,000 buffer over John's offer, making it a reasonable deal at this stage of the negotiation. Holding out for more risks Bob walking away, and the potential gain isn't worth the risk at this point."
