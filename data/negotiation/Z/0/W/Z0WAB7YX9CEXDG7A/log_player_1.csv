"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to lower the price if necessary.  I'll need to see if Bob bites or if he'll counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is still below my minimum price, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $120. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but still higher than $100.  I'm keeping my eye on the option of selling to John, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going down to $115. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. $95 is still too low for me, and I'm not yet ready to settle for less than my minimum price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my last offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. However, I'm starting to consider the possibility of selling to John, as the negotiation with Bob seems to be dragging on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going down to $110. I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this demonstrates my flexibility while also showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. However, if he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're at a point where Bob is only offering $90, which is way below my minimum price. It's getting increasingly likely that we won't be able to reach a compromise.  While I would have liked to get closer to my desired price, it's becoming more important to finalize the sale. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which meets my minimum requirement."
