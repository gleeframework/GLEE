This is a good starting point for negotiation.  You've made it clear you're not willing to pay Alice's full asking price. Now, you can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still above your maximum.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counteroffer again and hopefully find a price you're both comfortable with."
