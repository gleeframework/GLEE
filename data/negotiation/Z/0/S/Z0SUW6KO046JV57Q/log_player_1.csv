Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not going straight for my ideal price of $15,000 because that might scare Bob away. A slight discount makes the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Avoiding a Deal with John Immediately:**  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before I automatically go with John's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale at a decent price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worthwhile. I might counter with a slightly lower price, or I might decide to go with John's offer if Bob isn't willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Counter-Offer:**  I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  There's a chance he might be willing to increase his offer slightly if I push back a little.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I will make a counter-offer to Bob, likely somewhere between $10,000 and $11,000. This will show him I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the negotiation feel more balanced.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him, considering the product is worth $10,000 to him. This encourages him to consider the value he'll receive.
* **Setting a Firm Lower Limit:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I've made it clear that $11,000 is my lower limit. This prevents Bob from continually lowering his offers. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* **Prepare for More Negotiations:**  I'm prepared to engage in further negotiation if necessary, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $15,000, I'm willing to accept this offer because it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I would be forced to accept John's offer of $15,000, which is less than what I could potentially get from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the Deal:** I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale.  

It's always a good idea to secure a deal that's fair and beneficial to both parties, even if it's not the absolute best-case scenario. In this case, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
