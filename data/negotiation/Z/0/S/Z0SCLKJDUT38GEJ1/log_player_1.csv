Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $11,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $12,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $13,000?  That's a significant reduction from my original offer, and still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still sticking to my maximum of $12,000.  This is the absolute highest I can go. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, $12,000 is my minimum price and it's the absolute most Bob is willing to pay. It's better to secure the deal at this price than risk losing Bob and ending up with the same amount from John."
