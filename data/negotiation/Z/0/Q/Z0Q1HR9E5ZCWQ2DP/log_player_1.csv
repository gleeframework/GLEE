Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I've started high, the ""limited time"" phrasing suggests I might be open to a slightly lower offer from Bob if he tries to negotiate.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** I don't want to start too low and make Bob think the product is worth less than it is."
