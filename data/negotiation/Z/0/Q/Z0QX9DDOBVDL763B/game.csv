"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $13000, which would be $12000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
