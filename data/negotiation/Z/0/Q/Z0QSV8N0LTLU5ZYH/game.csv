"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is certainly appealing, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $1,100,000? This allows me to recognize your interest while still reflecting the product's significant worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
