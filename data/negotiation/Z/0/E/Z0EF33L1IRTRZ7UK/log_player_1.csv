Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm starting with a friendly, encouraging message to create a positive atmosphere.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I immediately state my willingness to negotiate to signal flexibility and make Bob feel comfortable making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum ($8,000), it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price and leaves me with less room to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price.  I want to see if there's more wiggle room with Bob before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit lower than I initially asked, but I'm willing to come down to $9000. That gives us both some room to compromise, and I still feel that's a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $9,000, which is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language (""I'm willing to come down,"" ""gives us both some room to compromise"") to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Rationale:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""still a fair price for the product""), which can help Bob understand my position and potentially sway his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I appreciate it.  $9000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is above my minimum of $8,000, making it a better deal than selling to John. It seems we're close to an agreement, and I'm confident that further negotiation wouldn't get me significantly more. It's time to accept his offer."
