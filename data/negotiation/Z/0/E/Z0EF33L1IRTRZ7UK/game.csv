"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit lower than I initially asked, but I'm willing to come down to $9000. That gives us both some room to compromise, and I still feel that's a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I appreciate it.  $9000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
