"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and it gives you a good opportunity to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget, and hopefully closer to what you're looking for. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $900,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum expectation. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This reflects the product's worth and allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's try to reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can realistically afford. I'm prepared to pay $910,000.  This is a fair compromise that's within my budget and hopefully a good value for you.  Let's try to close this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both willing to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $915,000.  This is a fair price that respects our respective positions.  Let's finalize this deal.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However,  $915,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is the absolute best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a win. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,8,
