"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering this product to you for $110. I believe it will be of great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you do $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $90 is a significant drop from $110, it establishes a lower anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Polite & Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's initial offer while clearly stating the price isn't currently acceptable.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer gives space for Alice to counter back, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than the initial offer, it's still above our target price. We've successfully brought Alice down from her starting point, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  There's still room to haggle before considering John's less appealing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice.  How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to meet Alice halfway between her last offer ($100) and our previous one ($90).
* **Sense of Finality:**  The language ""settle at $95"" suggests this is a firm offer, encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Still Below the ""John"" Price:**  Even if Alice rejects this and we go with John, we'll still be paying less than our maximum."
