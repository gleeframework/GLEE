"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that I believe you'll find attractive.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. How about $11,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
