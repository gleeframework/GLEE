Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. By suggesting that it's a good deal for Bob, you are trying to frame the offer in a positive light and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below the value of the product to Bob.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $97 is still less than what I initially hoped for, it's close to the middle ground and significantly more than selling to John. Accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable option at this point, as further negotiation might risk losing the sale completely."
