"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $95 is too low, and I can likely get a better price through further negotiation.  I'm willing to go back and forth with Bob a few more rounds before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $105.  This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible while also not conceding too much.  I believe this will be a good middle ground for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $100. While I was hoping for a bit more, $100 is a good price considering that John is only willing to pay $80. It's time to close the deal and avoid further risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer."
