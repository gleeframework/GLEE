"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $95, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her value of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $100. This shows Alice I'm serious about making a deal, but it's still a good price for me and leaves room for negotiation. If she rejects again, I'll consider going to John, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Alice."
