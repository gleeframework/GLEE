"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
