Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong buyer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for the full $1,200,000, offering a slightly lower price to Bob has the potential to close the deal faster.  
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer, I'm incentivizing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While my starting price is $1,100,000, there might be some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob counters. This still ensures I make a significant profit above his perceived value."
