Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $10,200 mark.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal. Accepting at $10,250 secures a $1,750 savings compared to John's price."
