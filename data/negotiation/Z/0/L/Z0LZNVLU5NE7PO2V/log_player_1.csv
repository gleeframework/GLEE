Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $14,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,500 is too far below my minimum value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this work for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
