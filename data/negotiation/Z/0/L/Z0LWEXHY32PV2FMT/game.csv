"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to come in a bit higher than $950000 to make this work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $975000.  This represents a significant discount from my original offer, and I truly believe this product is worth the investment.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",975000.0,Alice,3,
