"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the potential benefits this product offers.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
