{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business. My starting price is $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not ready to settle for $800,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
