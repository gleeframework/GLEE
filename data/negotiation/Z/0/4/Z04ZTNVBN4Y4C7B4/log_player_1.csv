"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. To start, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer that's slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get closer to your desired outcome.
* **Acknowledging Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reinforcing why he's interested in the first place. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language suggests a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

By starting high but remaining open to negotiation, Alice gives herself the best chance to secure a price close to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000).  It's highly likely we can find a middle ground that's more beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to work within a budget, however, $700,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm open to negotiating, so let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reframe:** Alice starts by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and his budget concerns, but she subtly reframes the conversation by emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Significant Concession:** By dropping her price by $75,000, Alice is making a substantial move to signal her willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price of $875,000 keeps the deal significantly above Alice's minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if Bob doesn't accept immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I still aim to keep my investment within my budget. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer now matches Alice's minimum acceptable price. While she might be able to negotiate a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or that further negotiation rounds won't yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting the $800,000 offer ensures a good deal for Alice and avoids the possibility of losing the sale altogether."
