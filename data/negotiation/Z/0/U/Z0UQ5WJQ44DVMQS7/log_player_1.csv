Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob values the product at $15,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I have a good chance of getting a price closer to the $15,000 mark.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** Offering a price lower than Bob's maximum allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Avoid risking a deal with John:** While John is a guaranteed buyer, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe there's room for a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $13,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** The counteroffer is closer to Bob's price, potentially making it more appealing while still leaving a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Maintain control of the negotiation:** By making a counteroffer, I avoid accepting a price that is below my target.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** I'm hoping this compromise will entice Bob to accept and avoid a longer back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,250 is only $250 less than my counteroffer of $13,500.  At this point, it's getting close to my target price and the risk of further negotiation failing and having to sell to John for a lower price is too high.  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
