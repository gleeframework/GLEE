"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $110?  It's still a great price for a valuable product. ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $110 is still slightly out of my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $105? I believe it would be a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a little worried we won't be able to agree on a price.  $105 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. ",112.5,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'd like to counter with $110. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Bob,6,
