Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $110?  It's still a great price for a valuable product. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $110 is still slightly out of my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $105? I believe it would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below it.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to get a little worried we won't be able to agree on a price.  $105 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 112.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

Bob's offer of $110 is finally above my minimum threshold of $120. While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on the potential sale to John."
