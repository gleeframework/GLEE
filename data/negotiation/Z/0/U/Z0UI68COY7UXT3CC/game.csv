"Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at no less than $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $1600000? This would still allow me to recover a significant portion of the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
