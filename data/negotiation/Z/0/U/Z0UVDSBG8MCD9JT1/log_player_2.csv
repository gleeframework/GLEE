"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $100 is within your budget, it's still too close to what you're willing to pay. You want to try and get a lower price.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a better deal.
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $120 gives you leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely interesting, but $100 is a little higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $92. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While closer to your target, $92 is still more than you're comfortable with.
* **More negotiation is possible:** You have 7 rounds left, giving you more time to get a better deal.
* **John's offer is your safety net:** You're still better off with John's $120 offer if you can't reach a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit much for me. How about we settle at $88? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $92 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell it to you for $90. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While she's lowered the price, $90 is still more than you're comfortable with.
* **More negotiation is possible:** You have 5 rounds left, giving you more time to get a better deal.
* **John's offer is your safety net:** You can still get the product from John for $120, which is less risky than accepting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $87, which is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to find a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another small concession. I'll sell it to you for $89. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:** $89 is only $2 more than your last counteroffer of $87.
* **Limited rounds left:** You only have 3 rounds remaining, making it less likely you'll get a better deal.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** You can still go to John for $120 if you're unhappy with Alice's offer, but at this point, it's better to take a slightly higher price than risk losing out completely."
