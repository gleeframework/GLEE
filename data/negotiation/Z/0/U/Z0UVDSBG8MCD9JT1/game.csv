Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think?,100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely interesting, but $100 is a little higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $92. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit much for me. How about we settle at $88? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $92 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell it to you for $90. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $87, which is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to find a good deal. What do you think?",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another small concession. I'll sell it to you for $89. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",89.0,Alice,7,
