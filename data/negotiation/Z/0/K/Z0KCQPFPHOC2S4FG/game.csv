"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This gives you a good deal while still ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  I believe this price is fair and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to drop below $11,000 at this point. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's aim for a quick resolution.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10900.0,Bob,6,
