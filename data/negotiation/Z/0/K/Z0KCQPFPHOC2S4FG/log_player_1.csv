Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I'm not ready to settle for that low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This gives you a good deal while still ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  I believe this price is fair and allows us to both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob, especially since he clearly sees the value of the product. I'm going to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to drop below $11,000 at this point. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's aim for a quick resolution."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  It's better to secure this deal than risk ending up with John's offer of $10,000."
