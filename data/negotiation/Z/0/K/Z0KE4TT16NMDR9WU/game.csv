"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested in the product, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product. I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
