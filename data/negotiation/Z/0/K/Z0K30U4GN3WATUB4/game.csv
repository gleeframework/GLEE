"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to make a compromise and sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a price that's still a good deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still very interested, but $9,500 is a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,250, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if that works for you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
