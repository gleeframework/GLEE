"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even cheaper.  Rejecting allows you to negotiate further and try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?  I'm happy to discuss further if that's not quite right."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $135?  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget.  While I'd prefer to pay even less, accepting her offer is a good choice.  I save $15 compared to buying from John and it's a decent deal for Alice."
