"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm serious about buying this product, but I need a price that works for me. How about $950,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I appreciate the compromise.  $950,000 is getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and go with $1,000,000? It's still a good value for you, and it gets me closer to my target.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer, but I need you to meet me a bit more on this. I'm willing to offer $960,000. That's a very strong offer, and I think it's fair given where we've landed in the negotiation.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to go higher. However,  $960,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's meet halfway again - how about $980,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",980000.0,Alice,7,
