"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my means. I'm thinking of offering $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the market value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, Alice, and I respect that. However, $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, as you suggested, and offer $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price that should allow you to make a profit while staying within my means.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $1050000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum price, Alice, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'm thinking of offering $1075000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
