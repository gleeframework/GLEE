# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1200000 is tempting, it's a bit below where I need to be right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the unique value of the product and its potential for you. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.
