"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Reasoning:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, which could make him more inclined to accept.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not starting too aggressively, so I can potentially negotiate down if needed. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware that I have a backup option with John, so I don't need to be too desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'd like to make a reasonable offer, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds left, and I can counteroffer and potentially reach a more profitable agreement with Bob.
* **John is a backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm not willing to give up on that opportunity yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low. Considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we're both looking for. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing flexibility by dropping my price from $12,000 to $11,000.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential benefits to him. This could make him more inclined to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** By framing the offer as a ""meeting halfway,"" I'm suggesting a compromise and fostering a sense of collaboration.
* **Negotiation Space:** $11,000 still allows for further negotiation, leaving room for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:**  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000.

**Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and force Bob to come closer to my target price. I'm confident that I can either convince Bob to increase his offer or  walk away and sell to John for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. $10,500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop my price to $10,750. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $10,750. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""meeting halfway"" again, which implies a sense of fairness and collaboration. 
* **Closing the deal:** I'm urging Bob to close the deal by emphasizing the need to be ""reasonable.""
* **Remaining above minimum:** My counteroffer remains above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Strategy:** 
* I'm pushing Bob closer to my target price by offering a slight compromise. 
* I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that we ""close this deal."" 
* I'm still confident that I can secure a higher price, or I can switch to John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's offer is stuck at $10,500, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited negotiation space:** There are only 4 rounds left, and I'm not confident that I can convince Bob to go higher.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk getting less or wasting more time on negotiations that might not lead to a successful outcome. 

**Strategy:** 
* By selling to John, I guarantee myself a profitable deal and avoid potential disappointment or wasted time with Bob.  
* While I would ideally prefer to sell at a higher price, securing a guaranteed $15,000 is the best decision in this situation."
