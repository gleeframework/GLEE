Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this work.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $10,250 for this.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  You've made good progress in the negotiation, but it's better to secure the $10,000 price from John rather than risk Alice not budging further."
