Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, I can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $120 allows room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significantly higher profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always lower the price or eventually accept John's offer, ensuring I never sell below my minimum."
