"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $7,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? This is still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",7250.0,Alice,3,
