Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, Alice should start with an offer closer to her own valuation to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth, potentially persuading Bob even if the price is above his initial valuation. 

**Important Note:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000.  Therefore, she shouldn't go below that price in any negotiation with Bob."
