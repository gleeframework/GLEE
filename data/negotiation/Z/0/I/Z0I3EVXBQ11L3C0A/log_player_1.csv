I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a higher price.  $12,000 is still a good profit, but I want to push for more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm counteroffering at $13,500, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a bit more than $11,500. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  While selling to John is a safe option, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a decent profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum, I'm not giving up yet.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get a higher price.  I'm also factoring in that we have limited rounds left and if we stall too long, I might be forced to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counteroffer at $11,500. This is a significant concession, but I want to close the deal before we run out of time.  I believe we can find a middle ground here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and this is a good price.  While I would have liked to get a bit more, I'm happy with the $750 profit.  Selling to John would only net me a $1,000 profit, so it's better to take the deal with Bob."
