You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a significant amount compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer, but still higher than my counteroffer, and it's significantly lower than buying from John.  It's a good deal that meets my goal of saving as much money as possible."
