Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I make a profit beyond my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $115 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $125. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
