"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's priced fairly considering its potential. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1150000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1100000 to make this deal work. Let's split the difference at $1125000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000. I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $1075000 is still a bit far off for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to stay at $1100000. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1100000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $1080000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and meet you at $1090000. This is truly my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1090000, but I need to get closer to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1085000.",1085000.0,Bob,8,
