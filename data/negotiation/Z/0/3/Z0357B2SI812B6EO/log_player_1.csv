Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's priced fairly considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation while still being higher than Bob's perceived value. It signals a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to respond with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1150000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this deal work. Let's split the difference at $1,125,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000. I think it's a fair price for a great product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, especially as we're nearing the middle ground. There are still 6 rounds left, and selling to John is always an option if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $1,075,000 is still a bit far off for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to stay at $1,100,000. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1100000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now offering a price that's closer to my minimum desired value, it's still below my ideal range. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, providing a safety net. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating, aiming to reach a price closer to my goal. There are still 4 rounds left, and the possibility of a better deal with Bob is still within reach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $1,080,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and meet you at $1,090,000. This is truly my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1090000, but I need to get closer to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1085000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, $1,085,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. We're running out of rounds and the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob is becoming increasingly unlikely.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get my desired price, I will sell the product to John.  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, which provides a better outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob."
