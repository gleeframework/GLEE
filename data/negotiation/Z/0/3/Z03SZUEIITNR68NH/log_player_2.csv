"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his ideal price point of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. He's aiming to find a price that both parties can be happy with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the price down closer to his $8,000 limit. While Alice has come down from $9,500 to $9,000, there's still room for negotiation.  He's not yet at a price where it's worth buying from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming to find a price that's closer to his target. He's offering a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest one, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. This also leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit lower than where I'm comfortable. Let's try $8,900. I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is only $100 more than Bob's maximum price of $8,800.  It's a very small difference, and it's likely that further negotiation will be very difficult. At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and close the deal. It's a good deal for Bob, and he avoids the risk of failing to reach a deal and having to buy from John."
