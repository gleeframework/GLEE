"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit lower than where I'm comfortable. Let's try $8,900. I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",8900.0,Alice,5,
