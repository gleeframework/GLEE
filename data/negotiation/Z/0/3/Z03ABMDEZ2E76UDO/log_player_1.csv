"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and slightly higher than what I believe Bob might be willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm mentioning that the product is ""fantastic"" and that Bob would ""appreciate it"" to highlight its potential value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob is interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed option, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob presents the potential for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I appreciate you coming down to my price range. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get great value from the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product offers great value, even at the proposed price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $145. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has come up in his offer, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob is showing interest and a willingness to negotiate further. I believe there's still room for a higher price that's closer to my desired range.
* **John is a Safety Net:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed option, but I'm not yet ready to accept the risk of getting a lower price than I could potentially achieve by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a final compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  This counteroffer aims to reach an agreement and avoid further rounds of back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $135 is a bit high. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:**  Negotiations have reached a point where further offers are unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum requirement.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already on round 6, and continuing the negotiation risks running out of time and potentially ending with a lower price.
* **John Offers Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price. This is a more reliable and less risky option compared to continuing to negotiate with Bob."
