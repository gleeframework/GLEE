"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is the lowest I can go.  This price still offers you a significant savings, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
