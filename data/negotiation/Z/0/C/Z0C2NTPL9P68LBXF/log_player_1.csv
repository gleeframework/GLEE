This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but is still within a reasonable range for you, considering your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $150.  I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $140. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum value of $150. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial ask, it's a reasonable price considering the negotiation and the risk of losing him as a buyer."
