"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to move this product, and I am interested, but I need to be realistic with my budget.  Would you consider $780,000? That's the best I can do.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $790,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",790000.0,Alice,7,
