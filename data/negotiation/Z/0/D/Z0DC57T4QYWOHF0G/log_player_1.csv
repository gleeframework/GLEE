"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, or if he doesn't counter, I'll make a slight concession in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I believe I can get a higher price, especially since Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows some flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept that price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it still leaves me above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I am serious about negotiating, but I'm also not willing to sell for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting too low. I'm not willing to risk going through more rounds of negotiation with him, as it's unlikely he'll come closer to my minimum.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $15,000."
