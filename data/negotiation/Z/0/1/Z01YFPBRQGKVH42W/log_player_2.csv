"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $11,500. I believe it's a fair deal, given its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $11,500
* **Your maximum budget:** $12,000
* **John's price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
