"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob ($15,000) emphasizes the potential bargain.
* **Leaving the door open:**  The message invites negotiation and keeps the conversation flowing.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while recognizing the need to secure a deal before resorting to John's lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can secure a better deal through further negotiation. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Bob's counteroffer shows his interest in the product and willingness to compromise. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price. 
* **Remaining rounds:** We are still early in the negotiation process (round 2), with 8 rounds remaining. This provides ample opportunity to refine our offers and potentially close the deal at a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I aim to maximize my earnings while keeping the deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,500?  This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $13,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  By framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, I appeal to Bob's sense of equity and potentially increase the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:**  A counteroffer keeps the momentum going and encourages a swift resolution.  

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties, while still maximizing my potential earnings."
