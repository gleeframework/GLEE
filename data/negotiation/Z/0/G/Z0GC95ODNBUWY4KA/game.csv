"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering,  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet in the middle again at $8,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000, Bob. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get at least $8,500. Can you meet me at $8,250?",8250.0,Alice,5,
