Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be very beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and give you an idea of his willingness to pay.  
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your pricing with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know the product's worth to Bob, consider if there are any factors that might make him hesitant to pay a high price (e.g., budget constraints, alternative products). 
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, aim for a win-win situation. A positive negotiation experience with Bob can be beneficial in the long run."
