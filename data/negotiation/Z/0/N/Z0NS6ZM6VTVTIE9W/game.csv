"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm comfortable offering $1,200,000, which is a substantial amount considering my budget.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
