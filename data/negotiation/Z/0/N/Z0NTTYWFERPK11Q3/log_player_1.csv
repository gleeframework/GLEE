Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a high anchor. While $1,300,000 is still less than your minimum acceptable price, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly and avoid missing out. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob.

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit with Bob while acknowledging you have a secure alternative if he declines."
