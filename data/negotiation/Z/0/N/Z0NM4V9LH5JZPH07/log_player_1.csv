"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you don't immediately sell to John for less than your minimum.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you leave room for negotiation and have a chance to get closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There are still 8 rounds left, and you can potentially get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Selling to John is too early:** While $10,000 is your minimum, it's not your ideal outcome. There's a chance you can get closer to your desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** You will need to send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above your minimum:** $8,500 is still above your minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Setting a clear expectation:** You're communicating that you're serious about selling the product but have a limit on how low you'll go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $8,250 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited time:** We are now in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases.
* **Possible better counteroffers:** While you could reject and counteroffer again, there's a chance Bob might become less willing to negotiate further.

**Conclusion:** 
Given the proximity to your minimum and the remaining rounds, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy to ensure a sale and avoid selling to John for a lower price."
