Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above your target, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above your target, and I'd like to make one final concession. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $1,200,000.  While you could try one more counter-offer, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000, saving you at least $200,000.  At this point, the risk of Alice not budging further outweighs the potential reward of a slightly lower price."
