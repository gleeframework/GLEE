"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $12,500. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $11,000, but unfortunately, that's still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. ",11500.0,Alice,5,
