Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $14,000, I create space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling pressured to accept my initial offer. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and leaves me with a substantial loss.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. This means there's still potential for a higher offer through further negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I can confidently reject Bob's offer because I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $12,500. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with $12,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Focus on Compromise:** My message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both of us, positioning the offer as fair and mutually beneficial.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm on my counteroffer, but I am still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $11,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and leaves me with a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is moving slowly:** While Bob is willing to negotiate, the progress is slow, and his offers are still far below my desired price point.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:**  With John offering $15,000, it's more profitable to sell to him, avoiding further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and selling to John guarantees a higher profit and reduces the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a favorable outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $11,000, but unfortunately, that's still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting this as my final offer to push Bob towards a decision. 
* **Slight Compromise:** I've lowered my price slightly to $11,500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum value. 
* **Clear ultimatum:** The message emphasizes that this is my final offer and if Bob rejects it, I will move on to other options, creating a sense of urgency.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing John will pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to make this a final offer. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a significantly lower price."
