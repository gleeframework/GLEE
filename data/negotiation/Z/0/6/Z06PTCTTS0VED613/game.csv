"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,400,000?  This would still leave you with a substantial profit margin. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,350,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000. Let's try $1,375,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to reach a more acceptable price point.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'd like to try to meet you at $1,325,000. I'm willing to make a bit of a concession to get this deal done.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $1,350,000. I've already made significant concessions, and that's my final offer. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
