"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's not even close to a reasonable starting point.  Rejecting the offer is the best course of action to start negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction and a very competitive price for something of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has reduced her price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  $2,000,000 is far too much, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffers and your willingness to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to make my final offer at $1,750,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true worth of this product. I'm hopeful we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her final offer of $1,750,000 is still beyond Bob's budget of $1,000,000. It's worth one more attempt at negotiation, especially since Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to make one final counteroffer before potentially moving on to John."
