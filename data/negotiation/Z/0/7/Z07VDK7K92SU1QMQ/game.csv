"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction and a very competitive price for something of this caliber.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffers and your willingness to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to make my final offer at $1,750,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true worth of this product. I'm hopeful we can close this deal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're unable to accept, I'll unfortunately have to move on to another seller.
