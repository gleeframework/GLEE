"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, so I'm thinking $15,000. Can we make it work?",15000.0,Bob,4,
