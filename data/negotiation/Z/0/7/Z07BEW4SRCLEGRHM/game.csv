,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but I would only be comfortable paying around $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To find common ground, I would like to suggest a price of $12,500 for the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value this product offers to you, I am willing to consider $12,250 as a final offer.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  To be honest, I'm finding it hard to justify going above $12,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
