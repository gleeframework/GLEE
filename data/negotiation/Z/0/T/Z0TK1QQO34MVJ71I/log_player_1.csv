{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $10,000, so you have room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:** You're showing confidence in your product and your negotiation skills.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what you're hoping for.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $8,000. However, my product is truly worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe we can reach a fair price. I would like to propose $8,200 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is closer to your goal, it's still below your ideal price. There's still room to negotiate, and you should aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,400? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 8400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $8,300 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiation is getting close to Bob's initial budget, and you've already conceded quite a bit. While another round of counteroffers might be possible, it's likely the price will only decrease further. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees you your minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further concessions."
