"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He has a maximum budget of $15,000 and Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for both parties to benefit from a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still within Bob's budget and a good deal for him.  He saves $4,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away entirely is not worth the potential savings. Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
