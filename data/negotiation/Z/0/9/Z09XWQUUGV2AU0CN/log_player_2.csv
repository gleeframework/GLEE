It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Even if you end up buying from John, the negotiation process with Alice might give you insight into the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is still within my budget, but leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still willing to push for a lower price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  $130 is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
