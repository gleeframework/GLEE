Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me a good margin while still being potentially appealing to Bob. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a decent profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $130. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds left.  It's better than selling to John and gives me a decent profit."
