"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, let's try $900,000. This price still offers you a significant value and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
