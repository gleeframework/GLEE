Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price than $15,000. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This gives you a great deal on the product, while also allowing me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$13,000 is too low, but it's clear Bob is serious about negotiating. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap.  I don't want to rush into selling to John yet because I feel there's still a chance to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. While $13,000 doesn't work for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $15,500. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500, but I'd like to propose an additional condition: if you're willing to sell it to me for $12500, I'd like to get some additional support and training with the product, which would normally cost $1000. Would you be willing to include that in the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted by the additional support and training, $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price or at least a better offer in the next round. I'm also starting to think John might be a better option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer and the additional value you're bringing to the table with the training. However, $12,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to include the training in the deal for $14,500. This is a good price for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price point. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000, but I need to be honest with you, this is my final offer. I've been trying to negotiate for a while, and I'm starting to get a bit worried about the product being available from other sellers. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's final offer is too low for me, and I'm running out of time.  Even though I wanted to get a better price, John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's still acceptable to me.  I'm willing to accept the slightly lower price to avoid further negotiation and ensure the sale."
