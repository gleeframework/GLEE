"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least that much. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $17500. This gives you a great deal on the product, while also allowing me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. While $13000 doesn't work for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $15500. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500, but I'd like to propose an additional condition: if you're willing to sell it to me for $12500, I'd like to get some additional support and training with the product, which would normally cost $1000. Would you be willing to include that in the deal?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer and the additional value you're bringing to the table with the training. However, $12500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to include the training in the deal for $14500. This is a good price for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price point. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000, but I need to be honest with you, this is my final offer. I've been trying to negotiate for a while, and I'm starting to get a bit worried about the product being available from other sellers. Would you be willing to accept this price?",12000.0,Bob,8,
