Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $17500. This gives you a great deal on the product, while also allowing me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. While $13000 doesn't work for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $15500. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?
