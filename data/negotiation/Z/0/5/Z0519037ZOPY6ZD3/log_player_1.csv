Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me halfway?

I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. $110 is still a good price for me, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a good price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $115. Would you be willing to pay $112.50? That's halfway between our last two offers."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I can do $110, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. I'd rather not risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $100."
