Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?,9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $8250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $7800. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $7800 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $7400. Can you consider that?",7400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my target price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm offering it to you for $7600. What do you think?",7600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to get a good deal on this product. I'm willing to meet you at $7200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",7200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $7350. What do you think?",7350.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $7000, Alice. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. I'm willing to make one final offer of $7000, and that's as low as I'll go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",7000.0,Bob,10,
