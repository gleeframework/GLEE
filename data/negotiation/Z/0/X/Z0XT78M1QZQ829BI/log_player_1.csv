"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not asking for my full desired price right away, acknowledging that Bob might counteroffer.  
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the deal aspect, implying that Bob is getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain my leverage and show I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100 for the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? "", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm not sticking to my initial $100 offer, but I'm also not accepting Bob's $90.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the Middle Ground:** ""Split the difference"" makes the counteroffer seem reasonable and fair.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Moving:**  By offering a specific price, I'm keeping the momentum going and pushing towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Improvement:**  There's still a small gap between our positions.  I'm hoping to squeeze out a few more dollars.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting shows I'm not desperate to sell at his price and might make him more willing to increase his offer. 
* **Time is On My Side:** I still have several rounds left to negotiate and can always sell to John if I don't get a satisfactory price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $94.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:**  $94 is still a bit below my target of $120, but it's a good compromise to get closer to a deal.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  ""Fair price for both of us"" suggests a mutually beneficial outcome and encourages acceptance.
* **Creating Urgency:**  ""Finally close this deal"" subtly implies that if Bob doesn't agree, we might not be able to reach a deal, increasing his incentive to accept. 
* **Negotiating Down to the Wire:** We're approaching the halfway point of the rounds, so it's important to be flexible while still pushing for my best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with $93 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $93 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are getting close to the halfway point of the negotiations, and while I would like to close a deal, I'm not going to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting shows I'm still willing to walk away if I don't get a better offer.
* **Potential for a Counteroffer:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I'm not under pressure to close the deal right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to my limit here.  Let's go with $93.50. It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 93.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm only raising the price by $0.50, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a slightly higher price.
* **Finality and Compromise:** ""It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal"" emphasizes the urgency and a willingness to settle. 
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm re-emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Balancing Negotiation and Risk:**  It's getting close to the halfway point, so I need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $93 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to the last three rounds. 
* **No Significant Progress:** While Bob has shown a slight willingness to increase his offer, we are not making significant progress. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering me my minimum price, and selling to him guarantees my desired outcome. 
* **Risk of Loss:**  There's a high chance that if I continue to negotiate, I might end up with a price below $93, or worse, no deal at all. 

It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $120."
