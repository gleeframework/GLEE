"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $10,000 to you. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $9,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
