"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $850,000 is a significant step away from what I had in mind. Let's try and find a middle ground - how about we settle at $1,000,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget.  To make this work, I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understanding of the product's value. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price that reflects its true worth. To move things along, I'd be willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're committed to that price, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $925,000. It's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another option.",925000.0,Bob,6,
