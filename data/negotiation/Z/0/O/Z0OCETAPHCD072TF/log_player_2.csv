Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique value proposition this product offers.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still significant.  I have another buyer interested at a much higher price. To be completely transparent, I'm willing to let this go for $1,700,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
