"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** I've framed the high price by emphasizing the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to influence Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""fair starting point for negotiations"" signals my willingness to discuss the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer acknowledges the product's value,  it's too far from my target. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, even if it takes a few more rounds.  Selling to John at this point would be settling for the minimum, and I believe there's potential for a higher profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique value proposition this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I want to maintain a positive negotiation environment by recognizing his counteroffer.
* **Significant Drop:** The substantial decrease from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000 signals flexibility on my part and might encourage Bob to make a more substantial move. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" as a justification for the still-high price.

This counteroffer balances firmness on my bottom line with a willingness to negotiate, keeping the possibility of a profitable deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000,  which shows my genuine interest. Let's work together to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still far too low.  He's moved by only $100,000 in two rounds. It's time to send a strong signal that I'm serious about a price closer to my minimum, and that John's offer is a viable alternative. I'll continue negotiating for now, but I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't make a significant move soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still significant.  I have another buyer interested at a much higher price. To be completely transparent, I'm willing to let this go for $1,700,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  I'm shifting my tone to be more direct and firm. This conveys the seriousness of the situation and my alternative option (John's offer).
* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is my final offer adds pressure on Bob to make a substantial move if he's genuinely interested.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While firm, I'm dropping the price by $200,000, a significant amount that might prompt Bob to reconsider his position.

This counteroffer aims to either secure a much better deal from Bob quickly or lead me to accept John's offer in the next round if there's no significant movement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to maximize your return, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant step towards your price and shows my genuine desire to come to a deal. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has finally made a more significant jump in his offer, it's still too far from my minimum of $1,500,000.  More importantly, his incremental increases and justifications suggest he is unlikely to meet my valuation.  

Bob's offer is now $1,000,000, and he's moved slowly in previous rounds.  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. Continuing the negotiation with Bob holds a higher risk of losing John's offer without a guarantee of reaching an agreement with Bob that is significantly better than what I already have.

Therefore, it makes the most business sense to cut my losses and accept John's offer for $1,500,000."
