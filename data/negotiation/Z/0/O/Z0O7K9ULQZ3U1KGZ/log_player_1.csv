Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, I want to start with a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Simple and Direct:** The message is clear and leaves no room for negotiation. This can be effective as it sets a firm boundary.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
