"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to me.  While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to find a compromise. This price reflects the true value and potential of the product.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit high. How about $875,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. How about we settle at $887,500? This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
