"Alice, $22,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product for me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
