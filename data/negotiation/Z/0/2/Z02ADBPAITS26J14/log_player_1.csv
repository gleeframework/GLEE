"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $70 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $80. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $80? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 80}
