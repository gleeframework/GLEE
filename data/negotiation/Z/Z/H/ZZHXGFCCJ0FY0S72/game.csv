"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-end item that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but my budget allows me to spend up to $10000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable selling the product for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your need for a profit, I'm still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. This would allow us to reach a compromise while staying within my financial limits.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. How about we meet at $13000? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and I'm not able to increase my offer further. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise between our positions.",12000.0,Bob,6,
