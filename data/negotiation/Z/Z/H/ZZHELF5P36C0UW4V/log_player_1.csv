"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. It's also a reasonable price considering Bob values the product at $150. This initial offer allows for a positive negotiation experience."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more for the product. How about $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering my budget, I am willing to offer $105 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is close to my target price and significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
