"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,175,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. Let's try $1,150,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
