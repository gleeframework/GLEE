Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to that price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's getting closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
