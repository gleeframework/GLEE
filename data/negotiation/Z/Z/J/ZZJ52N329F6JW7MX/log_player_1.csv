"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer. Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my previous counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is firm on his offer of $750,000, and I'm not comfortable dropping below $800,000.  Given the limited number of rounds and the risk of a further price reduction, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer of $800,000 and guarantee a profitable sale."
