Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're interested in the product, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $15,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to be close to your bottom line, but $15,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a good middle ground. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob is very unlikely to go above $12,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
