"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're claiming it has.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I believe $750,000 undervalues the product.  Given its potential and the significant benefits it can deliver to your business, I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and the value proposition.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I still think $850,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $775,000 is still below the value I know this product holds. I'm prepared to come down to $825,000, which is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's reach a deal and unlock the full potential of this product for your business.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.
