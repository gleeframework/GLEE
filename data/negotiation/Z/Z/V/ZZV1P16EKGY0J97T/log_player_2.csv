"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she completely rejects $80, we know we have a lot of ground to cover.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and interested tone, encouraging continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand it's a significant investment, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down a little, $130 is still significantly more than our $100 limit and John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Alice's counteroffer suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting, we signal we're looking for a lower price. 
* **John as Backup:**  We can always fall back on John's offer of $100 if negotiations with Alice don't yield a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making it clear that $100 is our maximum, making it harder for Alice to counter with a price above our limit.
* **Middle Ground:** By suggesting $100 (exactly between her $130 and our previous $80), we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and incentivizing her to do the same.
* **Time Sensitivity:** While we don't explicitly mention John, implying a firm budget can subtly suggest we have other options."
