Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $11,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a strong starting point.  I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm offering the product for $10,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that Bob will accept."
