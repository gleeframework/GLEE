"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be open to $950,000? It's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 is pushing my budget, and I'd have to go with another option. How about we make this easy on both of us and settle at $975,000? ",975000.0,Bob,6,
