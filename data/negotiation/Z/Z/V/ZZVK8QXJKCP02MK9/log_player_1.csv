Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $1,000,000, it implies that there is significant value beyond $800,000. This could pique Bob's curiosity and lead to further discussion about the product's benefits.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to share his thoughts, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts the $1,000,000, you gain an extra $200,000.
2. **Secure a Sale:** Even if Bob negotiates down, you're still likely to secure a price higher than your fallback of $800,000."
