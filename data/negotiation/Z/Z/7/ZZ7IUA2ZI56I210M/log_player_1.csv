"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the uniqueness and worth of the product encourages Bob to see its potential value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends on a positive and open note, ready to discuss the price further.

**Important Note:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This is a strategic move to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $1500000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and walk away with a guaranteed $1,500,000, I want to explore if I can get more.
* **Potential for Higher Value:** Bob's willingness to negotiate indicates he sees value in the product. 
* **Strategic Delay:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while keeping the pressure on Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,750,000 for the product. This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both parties can make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Moving Closer:** By splitting the difference, I am moving closer to Bob's initial offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal. 

**Important:** I am still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value of the product, I think $1600000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a Deal:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him walking away increases with each round.
* **Market Conditions:** Bob mentioning market conditions suggests he's serious about this price. 
* **Time is Money:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids potential further losses.

**Important:**  Even though $1,600,000 is less than my initial goal, it's still a significant profit and surpasses my minimum acceptable price. It's important to recognize that negotiations involve compromise and finding a mutually beneficial outcome."
