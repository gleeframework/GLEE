"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value to me is much higher. Let's talk!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my budget. I can't go as high as $1,700,000.  Perhaps we can meet somewhere in the middle? How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from this product.  Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,500,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my own needs. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
