,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $18000? This would still be a great deal for you and a fair price for me.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
