"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110? That's still a good price for this fantastic product, and it's closer to our original offers.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I can go, but I really think it's a fair price for this product.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're trying to stay within your budget, and I want to make this work. However, $108 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $109? It's a small step closer to your offer, and still a great deal for this product. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable going above $105. Would you be willing to go down to $107? That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for this product.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I can't go any lower than $108.  I've already come down quite a bit, and $108 is the absolute minimum I can accept. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. What do you say?",108.0,Alice,7,
