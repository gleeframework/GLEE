Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $115. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This should encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $120, and the option to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110? That's still a good price for this fantastic product, and it's closer to our original offers."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I can go, but I really think it's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to $110."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're trying to stay within your budget, and I want to make this work. However, $108 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $109?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable going above $105. Would you be willing to go down to $107? That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm still not comfortable selling for $107. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to $110.  I am also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $120, but I'm hopeful that I can reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I can't go any lower than $108.  I've already come down quite a bit, and $108 is the absolute minimum I can accept.
