Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. This is my final offer: $15,000. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but her ""final offer"" is still almost double your budget and what John is offering. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you risk her walking away entirely.  It's better to cut your losses and secure the product from John at a price you know works."
