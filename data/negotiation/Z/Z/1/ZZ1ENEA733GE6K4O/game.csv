"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. If you're open to something closer to my initial offer, I'm ready to talk.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. This is my final offer: $15,000. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll need to explore other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,
