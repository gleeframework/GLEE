Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,100,000.  This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above John's guaranteed offer. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get Bob closer to $2,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and reflects the true value this product holds for your business."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $1,950,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has signaled this is his ""final offer"" and the price of $1,950,000 is a strong return, well above John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  It's unlikely Bob will go higher and we risk him walking away if we push for more. Better to secure a very good deal now."
