"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,100,000.  This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $1,950,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
