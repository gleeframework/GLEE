**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer is a good starting point for negotiation.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget of $1,200,000.
*  Although Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting this offer saves time and effort.
* Buying from John for $1,200,000 would be a worse deal than accepting Alice's current offer."
