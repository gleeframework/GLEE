"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the compromise, but I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my limit. Could you possibly lower the price to $11,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
