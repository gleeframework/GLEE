"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it also sets a strong initial price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would love to get closer to my initial asking price, the negotiations have been going back and forth.  $1,250,000 is a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn."
