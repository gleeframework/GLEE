"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price that's higher than what the product is worth to me, but still lower than what it's worth to him. This gives him room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit.  I'll be watching his response to see if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to what I want, I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can come to a mutually acceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will show him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my desire to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I'd hoped, it's a good profit and we're getting closer to a deal. I don't want to risk pushing him away and ending up selling to John for the lower price."
