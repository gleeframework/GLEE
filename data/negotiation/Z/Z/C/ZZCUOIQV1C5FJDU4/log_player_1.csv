Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Exists between $1,000,001 (slightly above Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (slightly below your guaranteed price).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA, but you need to give Bob a reason to accept. Here's one approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. It's something I highly value, but I believe it could be transformative for your operations. Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Focus on Bob's Benefit:** ""Transformative for your operations"" emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **High but Justified Price:**  The price is significantly above Bob's valuation, but the framing suggests it's a premium offer for something exceptional.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Bob is rational. If he's a tough negotiator, you might need to start lower and be prepared to walk away.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive approach might be beneficial."
