# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something valuable at a price that's still very competitive. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
