Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range.  I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to negotiate and find a price we both feel good about."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, but it's not drastically low.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my value for the product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will show Bob that I'm serious about selling but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price.  While I would prefer to get a bit more, it's not worth risking losing the sale and having to start over with John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
