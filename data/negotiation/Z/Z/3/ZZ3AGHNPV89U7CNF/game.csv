"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about $9500?  That's a fair compromise, and lets us both walk away happy.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9500.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
