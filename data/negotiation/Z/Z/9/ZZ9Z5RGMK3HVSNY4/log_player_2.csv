{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left, Bob is running out of time to negotiate a lower price.  Alice has shown a reluctance to go below $10,000, and even if Bob makes a counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll accept.  It's better to secure the product at his maximum budget from John, guaranteeing a successful purchase."
