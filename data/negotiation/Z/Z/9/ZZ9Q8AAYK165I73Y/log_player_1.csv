Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This is a high opening offer, reflecting the value I place on the product. It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take $600,000, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer and attempt to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it well above Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also reinforces the value I place on the product. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer again to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, just slightly above my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go lower. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could counteroffer again, I'm concerned that the negotiation is becoming unproductive and could potentially drag on.  It's time to cut my losses and accept the guaranteed offer from John."
