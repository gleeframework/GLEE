"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the lower end of the price range.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $6,000, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,000 and $9,000. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $8,500? That's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,6,
