"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $15,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's a better price than the initial offer, it's still above his ideal price point. He has room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $12,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  He can get the product for the same price from John, so it's the best choice at this point."
