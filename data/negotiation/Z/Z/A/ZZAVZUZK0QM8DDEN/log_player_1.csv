Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation and get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It also keeps me above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob has come up slightly in his offer, it's still below my minimum price. John's offer is guaranteed and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob for a potentially lower price."
