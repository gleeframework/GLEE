"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Consider the significant value this product holds for you - it's worth $1,000,000! I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $850,000. This allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
