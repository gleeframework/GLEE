Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before it hits the open market. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning the open market, Bob understands that if he declines, he might lose the opportunity. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
