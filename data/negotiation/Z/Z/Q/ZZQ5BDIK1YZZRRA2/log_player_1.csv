Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

Here's why this offer is strategic:

* **Maximizes Profit:**  The price aims to get the maximum possible profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive.
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** The price is slightly above Bob's valuation, but the message emphasizes value, hoping to persuade him.
* **Below John's Offer:** It's important to secure a deal with Bob at a price higher than $100, ensuring you don't lose profit by going with John."
