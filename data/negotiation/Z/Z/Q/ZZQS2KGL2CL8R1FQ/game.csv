"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll still find the product to be a great value.",112.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $112. How about we try $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,4,
