"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
