"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out first. However, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
