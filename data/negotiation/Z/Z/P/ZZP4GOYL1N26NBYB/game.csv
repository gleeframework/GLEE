"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that price. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. I can do $12,000, but that's my limit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest,  $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I could let it go for $16,000, but that's my absolute best offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference at $14,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if it seals the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
