Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that price. Would you consider something closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest,  $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I could let it go for $16,000, but that's my absolute best offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference at $14,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if it seals the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

This is a good deal for you, Alice! You're getting more than Bob values it for, and it's close enough to your minimum to justify the time saved by not negotiating further.  Plus, there's always a risk Bob will walk away if you push too hard."
