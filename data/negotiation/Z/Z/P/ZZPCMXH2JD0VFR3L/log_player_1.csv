"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while also maximizing my potential profit. It's a bold opening move, but I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It's a reasonable compromise that hopefully encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer more, it's not worth risking further negotiation with only 6 rounds left. This offer guarantees me my minimum value, and it's a solid deal."
