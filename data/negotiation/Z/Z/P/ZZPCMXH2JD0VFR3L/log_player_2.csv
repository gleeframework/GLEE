"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice is willing to come down, and even if she doesn't, you can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget.  This aggressive move aims to signal my seriousness about buying the product while also testing the waters to see how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my desired budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating.  There's a good chance she's willing to go lower, and I have several rounds left before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering my maximum price. This is a serious attempt to close the deal. Since Alice is willing to negotiate, I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. If Alice rejects, I'll still have the option to buy from John, but I want to see if we can finalize the deal with Alice."
