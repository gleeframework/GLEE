You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product at $10,000, which is your maximum price. However, you have an alternative option to buy from John for the same price. This means there is no advantage to accepting Alice's offer."
