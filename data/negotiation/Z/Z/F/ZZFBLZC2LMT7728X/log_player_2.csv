{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good price, but I'm really looking to stay under $10,500.  Would you be willing to go down to that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? That seems fair to both of us, right?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a deal, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  But I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. Let's try to bridge the gap a little more. How about $10,900? It's a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal, but I can't go any lower than $10,850. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.  Let's finalize this deal, shall we?
