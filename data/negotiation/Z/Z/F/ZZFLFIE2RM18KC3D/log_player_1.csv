Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  $1,350,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers - I'll accept $1,450,000.  If you're not willing to come up to that, I'm going to have to consider other offers."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with a deal that's not beneficial to me.  John is a secure option, and I'll sell to him for $1,500,000."
