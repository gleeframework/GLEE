"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic price considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a great investment for your business. However, please note that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, so time is of the essence. Let me know your decision soon! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It makes more sense for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
