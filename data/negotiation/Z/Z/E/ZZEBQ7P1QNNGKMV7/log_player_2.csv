"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's still above his target price of $800,000, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000 again. This is my final counteroffer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice has already stated this is her ""final counteroffer"" and is unwilling to go lower.  Bob has already made his final offer, and it was rejected. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for his target price of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice only risks losing the deal with John and ultimately paying more."
