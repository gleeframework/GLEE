"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000 again. This is my final counteroffer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
