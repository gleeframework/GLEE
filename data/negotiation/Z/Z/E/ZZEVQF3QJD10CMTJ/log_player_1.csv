Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,025,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said,  $1,025,000 is still a bit rich for my blood.  How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly inching towards a more reasonable price.  We are still 8 rounds away from having to accept John's offer. It's time to apply a bit more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be firm.  This product is worth a considerable investment, and $950,000 doesn't reflect that.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to John's offer price. Giving a firm final offer now accomplishes two things: 

1. **Establishes a bottom line:** Bob knows we won't go lower, increasing the pressure on him.
2. **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, there's still potential to land between $1,000,000 and his current offer."
