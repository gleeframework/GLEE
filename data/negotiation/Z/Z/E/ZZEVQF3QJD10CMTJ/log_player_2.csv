# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be firm.  This product is worth a considerable investment, and $950,000 doesn't reflect that.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to her value for the product and is unlikely to go lower.  Taking her offer now secures the best price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
