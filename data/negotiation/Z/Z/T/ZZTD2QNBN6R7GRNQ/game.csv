"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $90, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $105. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do.",105.0,Alice,5,
