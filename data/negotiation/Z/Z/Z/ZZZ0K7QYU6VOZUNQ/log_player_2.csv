"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for as low a price as possible. Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price of $120. Therefore, rejecting the offer is the logical choice.  Bob can then counteroffer at a lower price and attempt to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $100 is a strong counteroffer that is still within his acceptable range. This price is below Alice's minimum value ($150) and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price closer to his target. He can counteroffer with a lower price and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. Offering $110 is a compromise that shows he's serious about buying the product, while still staying within his budget. This offer is likely to be more appealing to Alice than the previous $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's price, but $155 is still above Bob's limit. Bob should continue negotiating to get the price down further. While buying from John for $120 is an option, there's a chance he can get a better price from Alice with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is still within his budget but also closer to Alice's current offer. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. It also gives Alice a better chance to accept the offer and make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum limit of $120. With only 3 rounds left, it's a risk to continue negotiating with Alice, especially since Bob already has a guaranteed deal with John at his target price.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not be successful."
