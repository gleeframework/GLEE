"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction. Let's close this deal!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I appreciate your continued interest, $1,150,000 is simply not a price I can accept.  This product holds significant value for both of us, and we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, at $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that the product holds value for both of us, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but this time at $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
