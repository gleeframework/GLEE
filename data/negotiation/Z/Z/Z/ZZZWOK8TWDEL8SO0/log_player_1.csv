"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm aware that the product is worth $80 to him, but I'm hoping to get a better price than that. If he rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $150 at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm not guaranteed to get a better offer from him, it's worth exploring further negotiation before settling for such a low price.  I'll see if I can get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get a higher price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to increase his offer further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still keeping it above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I'm running out of rounds, but I'll see if I can get Bob to increase his offer further before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm reducing my offer one last time, hoping this will be enough for Bob to accept.  If not, I'll likely sell to John next round."
