"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price of $80. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to work towards a deal that works for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price of $80. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to walk away if she won't come down to my price, but I'm hoping she'll see that it's better to sell to me at $80 than to risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $80.  I have more rounds available, and I don't want to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still want a fair deal. I'm hoping she'll see that she's closer to getting her desired price with this offer than if she risks losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she's come down a bit more.  I'm determined to get the best possible price, and I believe I can still push for a better deal.  I have 5 rounds left, so I'm not desperate to settle for anything less than what I think is fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $100.  This is a significant move, showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching a compromise. At this point, she's likely to accept, as she's already come down quite a bit from her initial price, and I'm within striking distance of her desired value.  If she rejects, I'm prepared to continue negotiations, but I'm confident this offer will be enough to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is getting closer to my desired price of $80, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd still prefer to pay $100, I'm willing to accept this offer as it's within my budget and a good compromise.  I don't want to risk losing the deal to John, especially since I've already invested time in negotiations.  At this point, it's better to secure the purchase than continue negotiating and potentially miss out."
