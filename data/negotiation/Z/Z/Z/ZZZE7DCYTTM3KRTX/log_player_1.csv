Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000) but still above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, emphasizing a fair price. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware that I have a fallback option with John, which gives me some negotiating leverage.

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm rejecting his offer for now because:

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob initially valued the product at $15,000, so there's a chance we can find a middle ground.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** I have John as a backup, which gives me some negotiating power.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to close the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. 
* **Message:** I'm  acknowledging Bob's offer but staying firm on my desire for a higher price. I'm emphasizing the value Bob would still get at $13,000.
* **Closing:** I'm expressing my willingness to close the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still unable to go above $12,000 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutual agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is firm on his offer of $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  However, I've already made a counteroffer and attempted to compromise.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to lead to a higher price.

Given that John is also willing to pay my minimum price, it's  more efficient and less risky to sell to John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob would be successful, and I'd risk losing time and potentially the sale altogether."
