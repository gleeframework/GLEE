,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. How about we meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is still a good compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $9,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're sticking to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience and exclusivity of this deal. How about we do $9,250, and I'll throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal?",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional support you're offering, but $9,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to accept your previous offer of $9,000.  Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $9,125, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to accept, let's make a deal!",9125.0,Alice,9,
