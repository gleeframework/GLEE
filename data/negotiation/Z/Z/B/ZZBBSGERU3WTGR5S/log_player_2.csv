```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In an effort to reach an agreement, I am willing to lower the price to $12,500. This is the lowest price I can offer while still maintaining the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He has already stated his willingness to pay $12,000, and Alice has countered with $12,500. This is a reasonable price for Bob, and he would be risking losing the opportunity to buy the product at a lower price than John's if he continues to negotiate."
