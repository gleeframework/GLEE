"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to get a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? This is a fair price that considers both our positions. I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying the product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
