"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It makes sense to negotiate down from here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, starting with a much lower offer gives room for negotiation.
* **Anchor:**  By immediately throwing out my target price, I'm setting an anchor.  It signals to Alice that I'm serious about a price closer to my range. 
* **Alternative:**  I have the option to go to John at any time, so Alice knows I'm not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to get a fair price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice only came down $2,000, which is still significantly above your target price and what John offers.
* **Negotiating Room:** There are still seven rounds left, giving you ample time to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:**  By suggesting a middle ground, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to make a deal.
* **Incremental Increases:** Moving from $10,000 to $13,000 is a significant jump, signaling that you're serious about finding a price that works for both of you.
* **Time Constraint:** While we have time, it's good to start moving towards a potential agreement. This offer keeps the pressure on Alice while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? This is a fair price that considers both our positions. I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  Alice only moved $1,500 from her last offer, suggesting she has room to negotiate further.
* **Above Target:** $14,500 is still $4,500 more than John's offer, and you should aim to stay closer to your $10,000 budget. 
* **Time Factor:** You still have five rounds left, giving you leverage to push for a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying the product."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Moving up to $12,000 is a substantial concession from your last offer, indicating your willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintain Pressure:** While a larger increase, it still keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to your range. 
* **Time Awareness:**  We are getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation.  This offer balances pushing for a good deal with the risk of Alice becoming less flexible."
