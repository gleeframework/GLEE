"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create some room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $18,000 is still below my minimum value, so I have some flexibility if Bob counters.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to see the value in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is an Option:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to get a fair price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $18,000 to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum value. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting that my offer still gives Bob a discount, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to Increase Value:** I believe I can still get a better price through negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always a viable option, but I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? This is a fair price that considers both our positions. I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** My offer of $14,500 is very close to Bob's offer of $13,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise further.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the worth of the price.
* **Positive Language:**  I continue using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Round:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We seem to be stuck in a negotiation stalemate, with Bob unwilling to go much higher. 
* **Secure a Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further risk of a lower price from Bob.

**Conclusion:**  I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price closer to my minimum.  It's more efficient to take the guaranteed offer from John and move on."
