"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $1300000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1250000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000 as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $1280000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but unfortunately, $1280000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1220000, but that's my absolute maximum.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options. ",1220000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $1220000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to reach an agreement. However, I need to get closer to my minimum price.
