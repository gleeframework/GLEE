Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is closer to Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Framing it as a deal:** I'm highlighting the perceived value and framing the price as a good deal, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for counteroffers and a potentially mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **John as a safety net:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $80, so I'm not pressured to make a deal with Bob if the price doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While $85 is better than $80, it's still too low for my desired profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob clearly wants the product and is willing to negotiate. I can likely squeeze a bit more out of him.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I'd prefer to avoid selling to John if possible, as Bob is willing to pay more. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand you're looking to keep costs down, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes the offer seem fair.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal, even at $92.50, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Remaining firm:** I'm not dropping to $85, showing that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $87.5. This is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $87.5 is only slightly below my minimum of $80, and given Bob's rejection of my previous offer, it's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, leaving me with only the $80 offer from John.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag on and may not result in a significantly higher price.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's close to my minimum and is better than selling to John."
