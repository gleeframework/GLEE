Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my ideal price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob responds and if he's willing to come up to a price that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $650,000 is too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $875,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to counter again, but I need to be careful not to push him away.  I'm going to try and find a price point that is fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This offer is a compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer you $775,000. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price that meets us closer to the middle ground. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $800,000.  I've already made several concessions and it seems like we're stuck.  To avoid losing even more time and potentially ending up with an even lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and guarantees a sale."
