Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable value. It allows for negotiation space and also reflects the potential value you see in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I will counteroffer to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial price but still remaining above Bob's offer. It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a profitable selling point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only slightly below my desired profit margin, and  further negotiation might take too long.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and a profit that is significantly higher than selling to John."
