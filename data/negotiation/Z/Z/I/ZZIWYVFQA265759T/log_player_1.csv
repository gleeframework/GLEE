Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,650,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that amount. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to our desired price range, we have room to negotiate further and aim for a better outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,600,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,570,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous negotiations. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,570,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving closer to our price, but at a slower pace. Accepting his offer of $1,570,000 is a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
