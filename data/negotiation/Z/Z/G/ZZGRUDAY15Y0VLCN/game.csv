"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to go down to $825000, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other buyers. Let me know your decision.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $795000 for the product. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",795000.0,Bob,6,
