"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $850,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. ",850000.0,Alice,3,
