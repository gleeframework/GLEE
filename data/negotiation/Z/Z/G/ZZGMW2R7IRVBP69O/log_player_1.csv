Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob (""fantastic opportunity,"" ""competitive price"").
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting high, I create space for Bob to counter and for us to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk in starting high.

**Next Steps:**

* I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and determine if I should accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested. This gives me leverage to negotiate.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I'm willing to take a chance on getting closer to that amount with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than my initial offer.
* I'll aim to find a middle ground, hoping to meet Bob somewhere between $800,000 and $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $850,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $900,000 to $850,000, but I'm still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a ""win-win"" scenario for both of us.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than what he's currently offering.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation and keeps me closer to my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response. 
* If he rejects, I'll consider either making a final counteroffer or selling to John, depending on how firm Bob seems to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $825,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. If I reject, there's a good chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John.
* **Time Value of Money:**  It's better to secure a sale now at a slightly lower price than risk delaying and potentially losing a buyer altogether.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the agreement with Bob and move forward with the sale."
