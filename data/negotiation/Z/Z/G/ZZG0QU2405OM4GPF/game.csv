"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a significant value for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
