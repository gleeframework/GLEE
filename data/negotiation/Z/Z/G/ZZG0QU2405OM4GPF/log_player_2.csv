"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a significant value for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for me.  It's lower than John's price, and closer to my desired price point.  Continuing to negotiate might get a lower price, but it's risky as Alice might walk away, and I'd be stuck with John's more expensive option.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
