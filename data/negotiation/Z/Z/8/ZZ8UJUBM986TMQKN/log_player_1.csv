Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** While not strictly necessary, hinting that the product might be available elsewhere or highly sought after can add perceived value. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer is as much about gauging Bob's interest as it is about getting him to immediately accept $18,000. His response will help determine how to proceed. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower, but still above your minimum.
* **Negotiation Style:** This response assumes a collaborative negotiation style.  If a more direct approach is preferred, the offer could be adjusted."
