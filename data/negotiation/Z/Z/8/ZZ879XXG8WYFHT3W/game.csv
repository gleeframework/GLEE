"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still offers a great deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to compromise. I'm happy to come down a bit more, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
