"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $11000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with a price of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000, not $15000 as you mentioned earlier.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but no further. I believe this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the product.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'll make one more serious offer, $11500, which is closer to the product's true value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
