"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $9,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum of $8,000 and getting me closer to my desired price.  It's time to finalize the deal."
