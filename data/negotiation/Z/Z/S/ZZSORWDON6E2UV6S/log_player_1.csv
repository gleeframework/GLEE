"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000.  I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident it will be a great asset for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to settle for the bare minimum just yet.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. There's still potential for a better deal, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a profit that reflects the true value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is a good starting point,  I'm looking for a price that reflects its full potential. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm confident this price will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, while still trying to secure a better price.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a good deal and I'm confident it's worth taking. I've learned that Bob is a tough negotiator, but I've managed to secure a price that's higher than John's offer. There's a good chance that if I continue to negotiate, I might not be able to get a better price. It's time to close the deal and move on."
