"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $15500?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $15000. How about we try $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $14500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $15250?,15250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value.",16250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $15500 for the product. That's my final offer, I'm afraid.",15500.0,Bob,8,
