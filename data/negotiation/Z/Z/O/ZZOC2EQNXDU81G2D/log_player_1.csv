{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we're still a bit away from my ideal price, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're getting diminishing returns on each counteroffer. Accepting at $1,332,500 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling in the remaining rounds."
